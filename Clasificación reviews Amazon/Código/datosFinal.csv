4.0 out of 5 stars;Charges nicely but….;These magnetic chargers are doing the job and will charge both my iPhone 12 and my iPad mini 5… it charges at normal speed … my only issue with them is that the tops heat up and get pretty hot… I am a bit concerned about the heat issues… the C tips I have used to charge my Nintendo Switch Light and again, the tips get pretty hot… the micro tips also heat up when charging my flashlights and uv lamps… I will continue to monitor the charging tips to make sure that they do not overheat and cause damage to my equipment… the cables themselves are very nice… I like the nylon braiding on them a. Dina,so like that they are very flexible and not really stiff like other charging cables… so far, everything is going ok… it’s just the heating up part I am worried about…
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works as expected super convenient charging;Was hesitant to believe these would work but they do.I can’t tell you if the charge times are impacted or not but our devices are charging.We have not experienced and unusual wear and tear, connector problems into power plugs for wall plugs or “accessory not compatible” error messages on our smart devices.Side benefit if that it reduces the wear and tear on your charge port.Has not worked with all models of phone cases though as it does need some clearance to fit.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Durable;I like there was different size cords. Cords are durable. Blue light at end is cool. The one thing I don't like is that the phone will come off the magnet quickly and you not know it. Wish they gave more of the 3 foot to 6 foot cords in pack, but still good value.
4.0 out of 5 stars;so far so good ...;For apple device, just make sure you have the arrow correctly inserted or it won't chargeI have more apple devices, so I used up all of them.  And I only used one micro-C.The price is good, and it is easier for me to charge especially when driving.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Does what it says;So far seem like decent cables. Just wish they  give you more included tips for your devices instead of having to buy them separately.
4.0 out of 5 stars;magnets are weak;I bought this for my Oculus to make sure I didn't destroy the charging port while playing hooked to a battery.  It prevents damage very well, but the magnet is so weak that it doesn't stand up very well to my bouncing around when I'm gaming/exercising.  I find myself unplugged any time I get at all vigorous. Still better than destroying my VR headset, though.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great concept;Honestly this is a game changer . I upgraded my barber station by installing  these ports for my air duster , atomizer gun and I phone . It keeps the ports clean on my equipment and just feels so much nicer . I like the light on the charging cable to show its active and also  the magnetism on the cord tip to attach it to a metal cabinetwhen not being used  . So no more fumbling through wires to find your charge cable . My only complaint is that the picture shows it has a hint of gold and it arrived solid black. Bummer
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great but not phone case friendly;The tips connect with a strong magnet, and the connectors fit into ports tightly.  Since it takes less force to remove the magnet than it does the connector from the device, my phone's case won't allow me to remove the connector without removing the case.Aside from that, I'm very happy with the cables!  As long as the above is not a concern for you, can fully recommend!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Power up;I gave this system a 4 * review due to the fact that it doesn't work well with a case on my phone. The magnets are strong,  length of cords are great,  and it works well with my other devices.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Cool charger not for apple car play or android auto;"The media could not be loaded.
                



 The product comes with a variety of tips usb-c, USB, iphone or apple products compatible and chord sizes included in the package that hold on firmly. Pros: feeling of chord is smooth not plastic kind of like a rope. Flexible tips that also has lighting which is cool at night for easy access. Hold charge very well. Cons: if you do use car play or android auto it will not hold the connection, it does keep disconnecting. If you do want it for that feature i wouldn't recommend it for you but if you want something cool and also to charge multiple devices with one charger then this would be a good product. Be aware thought the tips are single point just if you want to get additional ones to do research so you get the correct ones."
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not for data;Being unaware of the differences in connections, I bought these. Several weeks in and so far charge phone as they are supposed to but I wanted data also, so they don’t do the job I wanted. Bought other data cables to replace them.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Standardize!;These are for fast chargers, and to be fair I gave them to my wife after realizing the use was limited.  I both a couple packages of the 'slow charger' variety.  These are NOT compatible with those.If you are going to get them STANDARDIZE.  Probably best to start with these since you don't have to have a fast charger.  The cool thing is that if you have multiple devices that require different adapters, this lets you standardize and have one cable that will connect to anything.Another awesome piece about these is the magnetic component.  When I get up and go, I grab my phone and if that may mean I pull a little harder on that plug.  Magnets just let go, a class 'c' could cause damage.
4.0 out of 5 stars;These are very convenient!;These are great is it takes away the need to have multiple cords as the same cable can be used with all of the ends.  I would give them a five star rating but they do not charge quite as fast as a regular charging cable. Other than that they are a winner!
4.0 out of 5 stars;A very convenient and cost worthy device;This product is simply amazing to say the least. It is an all in one charging cable with a multitude of connectors for just about every modern day plug-in and charge device. It also saves you money by not having to purchase separate chargers for all your devices. This particular one came with five different length cables and many connectors for various charger ports. That fact that you can attach your phone or other devices via a magnetic connection between device and cable to charge your device is an outstanding feature in it self. The cable looks and feels sturdy, you can't beat this product at this price point, I'm glad that I purchased it.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Only good for charging;Not good for USB cable for my vehicle but Bluetooth does work fine. This cable is only designed to charge not the transfer data.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Instructions & content identification;A huge glob of connectors included, without instruction nor description of use. Huge trial and error is cumbersome.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Newly bought: GREAT with some cons;Pros: GREAT for kiddos tablets and old phones who might not be gentle in caring for charging ports. My kids have destroyed tablets by pulling chargers out at an angle or inserting them too harshly. So this magnet application is AWESOME! I LOVE the hinge and long cord for my phone bedside. Little light is a neat bonus for finding cord in dark. I actually think these charge well at a decent speed. If you don’t remove the charger port tip it helps block the port from getting dirty.Cons: The port tip is small and hard to remove with phone case on in a situation where I would use my AUX cord to play my music or for corded headphones. (If you use Bluetooth to connect this is unlikely to matter to you)Also since the tips are so small they are easily lost if removed, my son already lost one first hour.Unknown: haven’t had them long enough to testify sturdiness and long term function. My son insists that the port he lost “fell out” but mine is tight so I am not so sure if it did or not. He’s not a liar but he is 6 so…lol
3.0 out of 5 stars;Okay just okay;Well I've had it for about a month and it broke. The little in the middle piece broke off. I hope I have another one. I personally like the blue light as it is easy to local at night and to tell the difference from another wire. It's not a super charge but it as good charge. My phone doesn't drain the charge more than normal.
5.0 out of 5 stars;really expected more :/;I first got these and was so excited! Loved the idea of the magnetic technology and since I have Multiple Sclerosis, my hands often don’t cooperate with me that easily. This product was perfect… for a week! Now I will say that from the start as soon as I chose an adaptive piece for my device and put it in correctly, I tested with the charger to see if it could withstand a pull while plugged in. NOPE! Came right out, adapter piece and cable. So I figured meh, for the price, I’d deal with it. But id noticed the “lightning charging” that was advertised was not shining through either. I have an iPhone XR, with standard apple lightning cable it should take about 45 minutes to charge, untouched, from 0%. For this charger, it took 2 hours+. Because of this, I no longer use these cables and won’t believe i’ll try them again. The length was great, no issues there. But shorting also came to be an issue as well about 2 weeks into use. I’d swivel the cable (as it should do) and it would disconnect and reconnect, I would have to fight to find the correct positioning sometimes. It became a nuisance and I gave up. It was nice-ish for a week or so. Don’t waste your money!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Magnetic Charging cables for Android Apple and others;Work fine but definitely not a fast cable. My OEM would charge my phone 70% in 30 minutes not this
4.0 out of 5 stars;Do yourself a favor;Buy several of these...being able to use the same cord with different ends is an amazing thing. The lighted magnetic ends is a nice touch for use a night. The fact that the end swivels helps in the places where most cords where out due to the nature of cords.
4.0 out of 5 stars;So far love it.;Easy to use
3.0 out of 5 stars;Great when it works;Magnets are definitely not as strong as they are made out to. While the charging can work if the device isn't moved, trying to charge while using the device is usually a failure and the connection isn't strong enough. The iPad doesn't charge at all, tried different cables, chargers and adapters. Definitely not buying anymore after this and am hesitant to even try other brands.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Fine but not amazing;We bought these as a way to charge mine and my husband phones so we could share cords as I have an iPhone and he has a Samsung. These were great at first but when I got a different phone case, it wouldn't work with my Otterbox. It also didn't allow me to use apple CarPlay in my car and had to use bluetooth, not the worst thing but I prefer apple CarPlay.My husband wasn't a fan of these chargers because it doesn't fast charge his phone. If he switched to a different charger, he had to take out the small piece in the charging port in order to put the other charger on. This caused us to loose all the small pieces(eventually all found) that go into the charging port. While this has really good potential it just wasn't the product for us, especially with little kids around. The small pieces are a choking hazards.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Low quality materials changing charge rate to 6hrs;Tried all of the cables and they yield the same result, even with different charge blocks. Magnetic chargers just aren't there quite yet. They all take a min of 4 hours to fully charge my phone.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Easy? Yes. Durable? Perhaps not;I loved the idea and ease of these iPhone cords, and my daughter loves her magnetic cords. I hoped that the connection would be more consistent, longer-lasting than a traditional iPhone cord.Nevertheless, within 2 weeks, my husband managed to separate the connector from the cord by pulling on the cord rather than breaking the magnet's seal. DO NOT DO THIS. Just as you do not pull an electric cord out of the wall by yanking on the wire, do not pull the cord away from the phone before breaking the magnetic seal by grabbing hold of the magnet itself and slightly bending it away to disengage it.The good news is there are several cords in the set and my husband is more careful now. After 1 month of use, I can say I like these iPhone cords. Just know that you must be careful when disconnecting the magnet from the phone or it will break at the hinge.
3.0 out of 5 stars;A picture is worth 1000 words;This product is questionable. So first off, the PROS: I really like that the end of the charging cord glows blue when not in use. It’s easy to see in the dark and let’s you know that there is power to the cord. I also like that the cords come in various lengths. Finally, I like the whole concept of magnetic charging. It’s so easy to connect and disconnect. Seems like less wear n tear on the cords. CONS: The mini dongle ( for lack of a better word) that you insert into your device is glued together. SEE PICTURE ATTACHED. I simply disconnected the wire from the charger and it fell apart. I also noticed that you must have the part that you insert into your device, inserted the right way ( For Apple Devices). Otherwise it doesn’t work. Most Apple compatible chargers work no matter how you insert them. Finally, I noticed that it was hit n miss when charging my iPad. I had to connect and disconnect the charger several times before it seems to finally connect. All in all, you get several dongles and dongle types. If they hold up, I’m still happy. If they continue to break. It’s a waste.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Can't charge phone if it's in a case.;"Cool idea, lots of little parts and dexterity.  But with an iPhone in a ""not really bulky"" case, my primary reason for purchasing, it wouldn't insert completely.  It's heading back to Amazon."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Cables ok, connector tips broke apart;"I bought these to help eliminate some of the many charging cables I have. most are Micro connections, and the newer devices have Type-C connections, so this is the perfect solution.The cables are fine, but the connector tips are lousy:The micro tips did not make a proper connection -- they were either loose and/or needed to be held in with extra pressure. I replaced these with a different brand.The Type C tips were initially great, but quickly failed. These are used in my Android phone and get a lot of plugging in and out. The first one lasted about three weeks, the second, about two.I love the magnetic connection and the bendable ends. Those were the main features I was looking for.These would be a great value if the tips worked.Also, these are generic cables. The Amazon listing brands these as ""Terasako"" and the photo even shows the name printed on the end of the cable, but these are completely generic. Even the box is generic. There is no manufacturer or company name. It doesn't even say what kind of cables they are.I've been looking for the Anker version of these, but I haven't found them yet. Happy shopping!"
3.0 out of 5 stars;Easy to connect;Works fairly well, magnet doesn't seem that strong
3.0 out of 5 stars;Don't allow data;These are only charging cables and will not do data if your trying to use with android auto
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great charging cords, BUT might not fit with every phone case;These cords are perfect and worked great for me - the only thing is, the little bit that stays magnetically in your phone's charging port is a bigger circle and might not fit with your phone case. They worked great with my old phone case, but when I switched to iPhone they did not fit in any phone cases i tried using. Only get these if your phone case has a wide opening, otherwise, i suggest going with other chargers
3.0 out of 5 stars;Great idea, mediocre implementation;A co-worker purchased this product and recommended it to me. It's okay, I don't really have a need for the 3 foot cords, but some of the connectors for the devices came broken. Not all of them and there were more than enough for the devices I wanted to charge.The idea of being able to hot swap devices and not worry about which charger you have is great when you have an iPhone for work and an android for personal devices. I plugged one into my airpods and the other into my galaxy buds along with the phones and it takes them a little longer to charge, but the convenience is worth the delay in most cases.Without the broken pieces I would give this a 4. If it included 6 foot cards instead of one of the 3 foot cords I would consider giving it a 5.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice but wore out after a little more than 6 months;First six months or so of this product was great after that getting a connection to my iPhone was just about impossible but it worked fine with a standard charging cableThe non iPhone connectors seem to be working fine. But I admittedly don’t use them as much as the iPhone ones so with more use they might not last as well eitherLove the idea of this product and was super happy with them until it started to not connect and charge
3.0 out of 5 stars;Works on Android;Works on my android but the other fittings will not hook to an IPhone. Also as an overnight charge works great but does not fast charge.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good choice;Did not allow me to get a loknger length.  The cord seems sturdy
3.0 out of 5 stars;No data transfer, just work for charging;No data transfer, just work for charging
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great for kids and adults!!;I got this pack of magnetic chargers because i was stuck with only one short charge cord for my phone,the different lengths are great short one for the car long one to reach my bed when im getting ready for sleep and want to scroll a bit lol... Since it comes with multiple i can keep one in multiple places so i dont have to keep unplugging and plugging in elsewhere , just leave the little attachment in your phone and you are good to go! And of course the big bonus is it works amaxingly for my kids who struggle to plug in their tablets, i just leave the piece in their tablet and they can magnetic charge anywhere without atruggling to plug it in ^_^ 10/10 reccomend
4.0 out of 5 stars;Slowly Charges....Sometimes;These Charging Cords Are Ok But It Sometimes Charges Slowly Like Almost 5 Hours To Charge So I Recently Bought A New Different Charger And New Charger Cord Else Where And I Will Not Mentioned Where I Got It But My New Charger Charges 3X Faster Then These Cords So I Would Recommend To Not Waste Your Money On These Cords Of What You See Here
4.0 out of 5 stars;Charge sucks;One sloght move and it disconnects from the phone, it's slow charging even if you have a fast charging box.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Easy to use;These where great loved them. But if you have kids are or not gentle on cords they don’t last.  I gave the review on how I used them till the kids saw the light that shines from them and played when I didn’t see and broke them on me.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Disappointing;I like the cord length and the easy connection. The bad thing is that the end easily comes out of phone and are not so durable as I have wrecked two of the cords and a couple of connectors that go in the phone.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Okayish;Most work fine. The loner cord sometimes (often) ntermittently connects and disconnects. Like while sitting on the table and not touching it....
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great chargers;I was skeptical that I would like these, but they are awesome. I have always had trouble with charging cords and this has solved that. I love that it comes with so many plugs and cords. Great item!Edit: It's been a few weeks, and I still like them, but one of the six foot cables stopped charging. I'm not sure why, it's still in good shape, I've cleaned the connections but it still won't work. But I just switched it out for another one of the cables. I had to drop a star for this, but still a good value.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not great;I got them because they had a right or left angle, so the cable would not get in the way while using it in Portrait mode.  I found that the plug ins didn’t last, I had to buy more.  It was just a good idea that didn’t last!
3.0 out of 5 stars;They work, but slowly;I loved the idea of these and like most people we have multiple devices all with a different type of charge cables.  The only down side i had with these, are they do not charge past 2watts and most products now days require 5 or higher.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Do not buy!;The pieces in the kit fit very well into phones tablets and other devices. The bad if you are looking at this for your phone or tablet it will only work sometimes and other times it will say connected not charging. You pull it off and reconnect it will tell you slow charge you pull it off again it won't even show connected very inconsistent. I will be using it for smaller devices that don't need a heavier charge rate but not for my phones and tablets!
3.0 out of 5 stars;If you use a phone case, forget about it;I bought this specifically for my son who MUST have a case on his phone.  He ends up destroying the charging port and I was hoping that keeping the port piece inside the damn thing would solve that problem. It does not.  I'm not returning them because we have plenty of other devices that don't require cases or have a wider charging area, so they will come in useful. So also using it in your car, IF YOU HAVE A CASE, is not gonna happen as easily as they say. (Which sucks for myself also). I cannot express how irritating this is.
5.0 out of 5 stars;I ordered the 5 cords for 5 I phones and there was only 4 ends for a I phone;Wish the five cords would of come with 5 iPhone attachments
4.0 out of 5 stars;Decent magnetic charging cables;The slightest speck of dirt will cause slow charging. Moisture quickly causes corrosion at the swivel. Otherwise, so far, they work great.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Takes forever;I really liked this at first. More cords than i expected and can fit iphone or android. I really like that it can swivel so you don't damage the cord. The con is that it takes so long to charge. I try not to let my phone die completely because it takes forever to even charge long enough to power it back on.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Very slow to charge my phone;If u have a big galaxy phone and are using tic tok in bed your phone will still die faster than the cable allows u to charge
4.0 out of 5 stars;Seems good for impulse buy;This was an impulse purchase for me when picking up a couple of charging cables for my devices. When opening the box and first seeing the item I didn't have much hope for it. As I didn't like how the replaceable heads attached to the cord. That being said after two days and using with two different devices (Android phone and Switch) I am quite pleased. The charge speeds have been really good for me and the detachable heads has so far turned into one of my favorite things about the cord. It is easy enough to leave the head plugged into the device and then attach the cord to what ever needs charging....So far after two days it is easily a 4.5 star product, rounding down to 4 stars instead of up to 5 stars because I don't know how long term the cord will survive.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Dunno about this;"I bought this end of Aug 2021. At first I loved it just to make my life simpler so I can toggle using tablet/phone with one cable where I'm sitting. This does not fast charge. I knew that going into it that a lot of the magnetic chargers aren't fast. that doesn't bother me. What does bother me is that one of the 6ft cord ends seemed to have melted or something? I have no idea how or why this would have happened. I was using it earlier in the day and came back to use it a couple hours later and found it would no longer attach to my phone. When I looked at the end it looks ""goopy"" like the center of it dissolved or something. I don't even know how to describe it so I attached a photo. The left is what it is supposed to look like and the right is what happened. I will not be buying this brand again. A decent should last minimally a year. Even if it stopped working, I wouldn't have dreamed anything like this would happen."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging, but didn't claim to be;I just got these today to replace my stock cables. So far so good, cords seem nice and the magnets are wicked strong.  However, I am disappointed they do not fast charge.  I ASSUMED all of there were. It's 2022.  My bad for that.  Otherwise I am satisfied.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Disappointed;Love the whole concept, cord length is great, magnet is strong! The only down side is the charging ability, it's very slow. Need to improve the charging speed and this would be a 10!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Fast charge, strong hold and pliable. Ps4= not compatible. Good product.;It charges fast and good has great hold and movement. But does not charge ps4 controllers.
1.0 out of 5 stars;No longer works;I have had these chargers for 6 to 8 weeks now and they have already stopped charging.  Of course it worked long enough to get past the return policy and then stopped working.  If my phone has 5% battery and put my phone on the charger it will keep my phone at 5% for days but never actually  charge it.  I have tried playing with it and nothing helps.  I will now have to buy more cables because I threw out my old cables.  This is a bad purchase and wish I wouldn't have bought so many and gotten rid of my old ones without testing first.  They also advertise how strong the magnet is and how you can hold the phone by the cable.  Yes you can if you are very careful but it is not as strong as it says it is.  Most of the features and details about these cables are lies.  Save yourself the frustration and don't bother.  If you really want to try them.  Let me know.  I have 5 cables and plugs you can have.  I will.ne er get my money back
3.0 out of 5 stars;Only For Charging, But It Does That Slow;Fine if you want to charge your phone, but be aware that it charges V E R Y  S L O W L Y.  It will not work for connecting your phone to your car via Android Auto or Apple CarPlay.
3.0 out of 5 stars;pretty slow...;Way too slow for anything other than overnight.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works well can’t beat the price;Doesn’t charge quite as fast as a regular cable but it’s not too slow either.Magnet is pretty strong, I wouldn’t recommend try to pick it up by the cord with a bulky phone like the iPhone 12 Pro Max, but it will never come off by accident.So convenient to not have to have multiple different cables and at this price you can buy multiple packs and scatter them in every room of your house.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works well except doesn't fully charge iPad in a reasonable time.;The positives:  Love the braided cord.  Really like the one that has a swivel connection.  This will result in less damage and replacement of cords.Now the issue:These are good EXCEPT that they do not work well for iPads.  I plug in my iPad overnight and it still does not have a full charge by morning.  Using a standard plug provides a full charge (so it's not my iPad at fault).  The only other issue I have found is that if multiple people have devices, but they don't have the proper connection, they can't use this cord.  For instance, I have one of these permanently plugged into my car.  When someone who does not have this set is in my car, they can't plug their device in.
3.0 out of 5 stars;perfect depending on your phone CASE;READ! BEFOR YOU BUY, If you have a hard case or full cover case this is not for you as it need to be all the way inside to latch on properly or you would have to take of your case to plug it in properly.•Charging power/time would depend on your brick/portable batteryPros:•very good cables•different lengths of the cables•perfect for kids ipad or phones since they always use the phone/table while chargingCons:•not for all phones with Hard case or full body case.•when using the wire for a while it kinda gets stiff.•is not able to transfer data or updates (TESTED with a ps5 controller)
3.0 out of 5 stars;Low Charge rate;This cable charges at less than half the wattage compared to a regular cable. I like it but if you want fast charging this is not it.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great charging cables, great value;Magnetized charging cables and connectors are far more superior to conventional charging devices. Quick release and charging power are just some of the advantages over regular charging cable accessories
5.0 out of 5 stars;Charging;The media could not be loaded.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Cool concept… works well mostly;These cables are great and convenient, but require a bit of commitment to the system. If you leave the tips in your devices it can work well… but, if you’re out somewhere away from your cables and need to charge, you’ll need to remove the tip and sometimes they get lost.Also, I have to pull the magnetic cable off to the side and not straight out or the tips sometimes come off attached to the cable. Strong magnets.Also, for some reason, they don’t seem to work in my Honda Fit and once in a while in other usb chargers. Not sure why. This is why they get 4 stars instead of 5.
4.0 out of 5 stars;falling apart;"I thought these were great, but my 10"" only lasted 3 months before falling apart at connection swivel point"
3.0 out of 5 stars;Works well when the inserts work;We use these all the time, we ended up with 2 sets and the different charging ends are in several of our commonly used devices. The idea is brilliant for making cables universal and the ends that do work charge our phones, tablets, and other items fairly quickly. The light at the end of the cable makes it easy to find them in the dark but may not be ideal for everyone since the light is pretty bright. Unfortunately 2 of the 8 Type C plugs we have do not work at all. luckily we had enough to just use other ones but 25% makes me a bit worried about how long the rest will last if 1/4 were DOA.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Works great on my IPhone, not so much with my tablet;No issues at all with using the product with my phone. However, with my IPad tablet, the cord was very positional to get it to charge. I also had to be careful when disconnecting because it would also remove the insert as well. (By the way, unlike a lightening plug which is double sided, these are only one sided so you may have to flip it over to get a proper connection.) I ended up going back to my original charging cable on the tablet.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Works. Until it doesn't.;I liked that it was magnetic, so I wouldn't constantly be plugging in/unplugging the charger. I didn't like that it took a looonng time to charge. I liked even less that the charger tips (not the tabs) break off so easily. I downright HATE that the last one just now died. I don't think I'm going to try again
4.0 out of 5 stars;they work well enough;they work well enough, have used them for 3 weeks now with no issues, hope they keep up the performance and durability
4.0 out of 5 stars;Lowered a star :(;It stopped charging my iPad. I changed the adapter.Still charges my iPhone.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Love them so far BUT THERE IS ONE FLAW!!!;I like them so far but I'm super bummed that it doesn't allow the Apple Car Play to connect..😫😣☹️
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good in theory;Bought these to replace my multiple car chargers but ran into a couple of issues.1.) Could never get these to fast charge on any block2.) When you uplug from your device, the magnet tip stays stuck in the phone port. If you have a case, having to constantly dig out the charger tip is annoying.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Takes to long to charge.;The principal behind the charging cord is great. Small children can charge their tablets themselves.  But if you are looking for a rapid charge, this doesn't do that. Normal charge time for my phone is around an hour, with the magnetic charger it takes about 4 hours.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Drains battery (Samsung Galaxy)--edited: but customer support is excellent;*Edit*So I requested help with the product and they were very responsive and honored my request. I think if they are able to obtain and market a more reliable product, it would be good. But I am impressed and thankful for their customer support!-------------------------------------------------It's very convenient and gets rid of the breakage/loosening of the fastener, but after a few days, I noticed that it drained my battery! It also takes a long time to charge.  I really appreciated the versatility of it, but too bad about draining my battery. I almost thought it ruined my phone, but after I reset my phone and went back to the traditional charger, it was fine.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not for iPad Pro!;Doesn’t charge my iPad Pro at all.  Works perfect for AirPods and the Nintendo Switch
4.0 out of 5 stars;NICE IDEA BUT.....;What type of phone case works with this product? Not mine.... Should partner with Otterbox and then it would be awesome!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn’t work with phone case on!;It’s awesome but the part that goes in the phone needs to be longer so you can charge with your case on. Love it’s got a light at the end. Not a fan of taking the case off to charge.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Worked ok at first, then power fell;The charger still works, and the idea is novel and convenient, but not long after having it, the amount of power output dropped significantly. It still works, but as a very slow charger, sometimes taking 5-7 hours to charge my phone. I have used other known good charging plugs that are much faster with other wires, but now these wires are very slow. Sometimes if you wiggle the port or such it will jump up to 2-3 hour charge, but only says that as long as you're applying pressure to the port. So not a viable solution.The magnet is strong enough to pick up my phone with it's case on. But other than that, this is not worth it to me. I would not recommend this product to other people. I like the idea, but it does not last.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Cheap product;This is the first time I've ever bought charger cords that refuse to work with a plug in wall charger or my computer.  The ones I received only work with built in USB ports like in the base of a lamp you see in a hotel. I don't know many people who have that kind of built ports. So basically they are completely worthless. Even if you have the built in ports, you can't get fast, lightning, or anything else remotely quick charge. A 23% charge on my Samsung 5G 2022 model phone takes 1 hour 24 minutes. Buyer beware.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Nice set - be careful;I was excited about this setup when it showed up. It comes with everything I needed for all my devices different plugs. I quickly realized I get very hot. Like jerk your little finger away as soon as it touches it. I don’t use it on my phone or laptop anymore - worried it will mess something up. I only use it for all my little gadgets that charge in 15-20m. BT Speakers - head phones - etc .
4.0 out of 5 stars;Really easy and large, clumsy dog friendly;It's nice knowing I can set my phone on a table while it's plugged in and if my dog runs past, grabbing the cord in the process, he won't pull my phone with him. Also, there is a small light at the very end which makes plugging your phone in while it's dark super easy. Thankfully, once the phone is attached the light is no longer visible! So no blue light keeping me awake all night.Only downside is that it wasn't a fast charge.  Ultimately ended up sending these back since my other cords charged my phone 50% faster.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Fast Charging?;I have devices capable of fast charging. These did not function for me. I got constant errors telling me to use the manufacturer cable.  I own a Note 20.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Very slow charge;Pros:-Magnet works great, doesn't accidentally fall out and is very secure-Being able to use 1 cable for every device is awesomeCon:-Charges very slowly, my 10,000mah phones charging case takes 10+ hours to charge-No data transfer
3.0 out of 5 stars;Very nice to have but beware of it's minimum charge speeds.;Great for most small devices but it only charges 5w2a max, which is bare minimum for any device. Every magnetic charging cord I have seen has been the same. Must be a limitation of the technology although idk why. For the most part, even that super low power covers most devices overnight. I bought it, not seeing the max output, hoping it was just copper and it would charge whatever the wall wart outputted. I was wrong. Just don't buy this hoping it'll cover any larger devices or fast charge. It won't.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Cords;Some of the adapters did not work. One of these sets was a Christmas gift and the recipient didnt want the hassle of returning
4.0 out of 5 stars;the connection wasn't always perfect but it will do.;it's an okay set of cords, sometimes you have to mess with the connection tough.
4.0 out of 5 stars;good cable package;They work very well and reduce or eliminate the strain on the plugs and cable ends.  Just be aware if you have a case with a port cover for your charging port, the magnet remains in place, so the cover will stick out slightly.  The magnet attaches quickly and without much alignment.  Charging is good through the cable.  Read the disclaimer, not sure if it does data transfer through the cable.I also wish they sold multi-packs or individual 10'ft cables.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Charging AND playing simultaneously.;Simply love it!  Over the years I was constantly replacing frayed or broken cables. I think So far that this one is quite durable and also allows you to charge and use simultaneously.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not worth it.;My phone over heats with this. This is cool. but not worth it.
2.0 out of 5 stars;i-connectors not to spec - wriggles right out;The product's i-connector (iPhone) is slightly shorter than the standard Lightning connectors.  The connector/product measures 5.90 mm, compared to the standard cable lightning connectors of 6.89 mm.  This means that your product can wiggle loose when small latitudinal forces are applied. The connector falls right out due to the weight of the cable.I tried the connectors with and without a case on multiple phones and the same thing happens.  the Locking mechanism doesn't fully engage because of the measurements listed above.The cable itself is nicely braded.  Since it is only handling power it is slightly thinner than a standard lightning cable.  Overall if the i-connector stayed in this would be a smashing good product.The other connectors, micro usb and usb-c work very well.  I am giving Terasko support an opportunity to provide i-connectors that are the right spec, or I will be returning this product (since I will be using them primarily with my apple devices)5-10-22 Update:Support says their newer product has updated I-connectors. They refunded my purchase and recommended trying the newer product.
3.0 out of 5 stars;The magnetic ends do  not hold very well when using your phone while it’s  Charging.;I like the fact that the cord is sturdy and it has plenty of length to move around. I bought this for the magnet to make life easier when I charge my phone because I am in the a wheelchair and my hands are weaker than they were before I broke my neck, but the magnet doesn’t fit into my iPhone deep enough for a connection to charge it, and the magnet only works on one side for the iPhone because they only put the little gold connectors on the back side facing the back of the iPhone when you try to charge it.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Falls off  of the phone;It charges slowly. The worst issue is that the cable came loose at any slight motion, even just picking up the phone. Very disappointing...
2.0 out of 5 stars;Neat idea, cable underperforms;Several cords of varying lengths are pretty handy and the magnetic part attaches well to charge the device. However, the cable did not allow for fast charging and one cable charged so slowly it didn't even keep up with my phone.
3.0 out of 5 stars;No data transfer;I did not realize that these did not allow data transmission / GPS useage. Otherwise I'm sure they are fine.
5.0 out of 5 stars;I love these cables.;I love these cables.  They work just fine and when the device is connected and you want to grab and run, you can.  You don't have to stop and fiddle with it unplugging the cable.  Just grab the phone and walk away.  The cable stretches out to the end and pulls the magnetic connector apart as the cable hits the end.  You don't have to have a magnifying glass to see the orientation of those pesky little micro USB plugs to connect.  Just bring the magnetic end close to the magnetic insert that lives in the phone port and they snap together.  I use them on samsung phones, android tablets, Ipads, MP3 players and several other items.  I think they are great.  I've been using them for about 6 months or so now and they seem to be holding up just fine.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Warning Tips too short;"The tips where you connect to your phone are ""short"" or the circle is too big. Therefore, if you have a phone case, this cable is useless. It can't insert fully, so can't charge."
1.0 out of 5 stars;It's not worth it;I was super excited about this purchase. I was worried about all the pocket and air dirt getting into my charger port with every movement. So I bought these because they claimed to be fast chargers.For the first 2 weeks they were great. Then they started dying very quickly. Instead of an hour to charge my phone (while I was NOT on it) to suddenly 7 hours or 4 hours or however long it wants to take.I just had it connected to my phone while I was in the bathroom and IT LOST BATTERY WHILE BEING PLUGGED IN. Nothing has touched liquid, the cable has been in one spot the entire time. So I moved plugs...same thing. Maybe it's the box it's plugged into? Used a different box and same result. I even plugged my old cable into the port and it's charging my phone now. It went from 1% to 12% in the 3 mins it took me to write this review.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Get to what you give;Another roll of the Amazon roulette with a cheap product.  It works but nothin special honestly and make sure you put the piece in the charging port the correct way or you will return to a battery not with 100% but 1%.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn’t last;This product we found to be slow charging then they started to come apart within just weeks of starting to use.  Don’t recommend.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Great Idea and convenient but ultimately slow charging.;This cable is great for quick application and the swivel aspect is helpful. The main job of this product is to charge and my experience is that is is lacking. I actually loose charge while using it when I am using the phone.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Mhhhh....;I purchased this because it's a great concept however, it wasn't worth the money. The little magnetic charger that goes in the phone, falls out so easily. Mine kept slow charging no matter if it was plugged into a vehicle or into a wall outlet.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Best purchase yay for charging cables;This is the best buy that I have done for  charging cables. So useful I have put them on all my charging devices
2.0 out of 5 stars;Won't charge everything;No problem with charging my phone. Will not charge any of my Samsung tablets but will charge my mother's ipads - slowly. Checked to ensure the magnet is securely in the tablet port.Also, the car's USB port does not recognize my phone when using the magnetic cord.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great buy;They light up when not connected to the phone and light shuts of when connected, charges just as fast as other cables. Only problem is they disconnect pretty easily.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Micro USB Tips did not make connection unless I hold pressure into the usb jack.;Micro USB Tips did not make connection unless I hold pressure into the usb jack. I already had another tip from an earlier purchase of another brand that works fine. If I use that tip from an earlier purchase the cables work great but the tips that came with this purchase are useless. I really like these cables because not only does the end pivot but when connected to charge their is NO LIGHT to keep me awake at night. There is a light in the end of the cable but it's hidden when attached to charge. I will probably keep this set just for the cables but I do need more tips.Note: I have a new phone, so there is no lint inside the micro-USB jack that could contribute to this issue. I also tried the tips in other items (tablets & phones) with the same results.Note: looking into the end of the micro usb I can see the metal contacts are not at an even height. This could be the cause of the no connection issue. Unless I am holding pressure, pushing it into the phone there is no connection. My Tip from another purchase that works fine is not this way. All the metal contacts are evenly placed within the tip.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Work good, when they work.;I bought three orders of these.Each order has had one cable stop working in the first week.They do work well, at least the ones that do work.If I would need more, I’ll probably try a different developer.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Cord does not last long;What I like was the way it connects. But with in 2 weeks cord goes to charging fast to slow charging .on same phone  tried on a different phone it was slow charging also. But say it can work on on these phones bought a new phone last night galaxy 10 slow charging on it to other phones were galaxy 8+
2.0 out of 5 stars;Worked, and then didn't the next day.;This product stopped charging my iPhone on the second day of owning this cord.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good for c connector;Works really well on my android device. Charges very slow or not at all on iPad. The adapter has to be put in one way to work,  if flipped over does nothing. When it does work it charges very slow. Item works great on android though.
3.0 out of 5 stars;I love these;I wish the piece that goes in my iPhone fit tighter, I have lost several. I bought a set with straight cords last year and the magnetic plugs were plenty tight on them.
2.0 out of 5 stars;"One of the magnets broke into 3 pieces. It""s rather thin.";"One of the magnets broke into 3 pieces. It""s rather thin."
3.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't support fast charging.;The cable is a functional master peice. The only problem is charging power along with speed. It doesnt support fast charging and only maintains your current battery status when plugged in and using phone at the same time. When not using phone, it takes about 3 hrs to charge my Note 9 with a fast charger.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Very Disappointed;The magnetic connection aspect is great. But they don't last very long...or maybe they're just not made to withstand fast 3amp charging. Because they operated and charged fine for a while. Then I noticed it began taking longer and longer to charge to the point my cell phone notify me of slow charging and 7hr estimate to full charge from 50% battery. I switch back to my prior regular cable and it reads fast charging again. So it's not my wall charger, it's the charging cable. And this has happened to both myself and my wife's cables. They still look new and aren't broken or anything. They just quit charging properly. I would not recommend these.
4.0 out of 5 stars;These are so easy to use!;Maybe I'm asking too much, but it would be great if these cables would pass data.  Unfortunately, they are only good for charging.  But for charging, they are great!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Does not work with either protective case I have.;They seem like a good cords and it is a good idea, but Ibhave a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra and they do not work with either phone case I have. They are to big where the tip meets the connector to the cord to fit.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Slowest charge I've ever seen;Well constructed and strong magnet. But, not very effective at charging - took 11 hours to charge an iPad and in 6 hours my cell phone only charge from 22% - 71% (used different cables from the package).
3.0 out of 5 stars;If it charged at 45-65w it would be a 10!;I love the flexibility of this cord but it only charges at 25w. I prefer 45-65w so I passed it on to my granddaughter's tablet.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Works so far...;"Works so far... Only one six foot cord didn't light up and now doesn't work. but we don't care about that. they do not support fast charging or work on fast charging pads so keep that in mind... I do appreciate that the tips work with the ""Statik Power 360 Cable"" that we already bought."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Convenient;I have I-phone, android tablet, android phone, blue tooth headphones.  I just plug the adopters (provided) and one cord will charge them at a time.  Actually I have one cord in the car and couple places at home and all my devices get charged.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not for Apple CarPlay;I purchased this mainly for the vehicle. After seeing the picture of the phone in the vehicle and no warning that it wasn’t CarPlay compatible, I purchased this assuming it was. It wasn’t it. It will still charge the phone, but that’s all it does.The bottom of the the little magnetic piece that inserts into the phone has has a little contact piece that protrudes further than the base and can dig into your finger.The cord is very thin and feels cheap. The lightning  insert (for iPhone, iPad, etc) have contacts one one side only. So make sure it is inserted the correct way or else it won’t charge it.Only time will tell how long these will last.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great Cord not so durible.;I love the fact they offer different lengths. This cord works perfectly and has not failed to charge all of the different devices I own.However it had one flaw with one of the cords where  the magnetic head fell right off.other than that all other cords worked flawlessly. I want to believe this is a one off situation and would continue to purchase their products in the future.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Short life span;Worked great for a while but didn't last more than a few months
3.0 out of 5 stars;Works fine. Metal magnet connector gets HOT;For anyone with an iPhone, the included lightningcable tips only have the prongs on one side of the tip. The tip DOES work, however you might just have to flip the tip over and insert it into your phone the opposite direction if the first direction does not charge.I’ve found while charging my iPhone 11pro max that the metal part of the magnet connector gets insanely hot to the touch. I’ve burned my fingers if they accidentally touch it while using my phone. Not sure if that is a potential fire hazard?Other than that, it charges all my devices fine. A little slow but not horribly so.5 cords and a bunch of connector tips for this price is a good deal.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not suitable for bedroom due to LED.;I really wanted to like this, it is a cool concept.  But there’s a few details they just didn’t get right.  1) The charging times are very slow, slower than a Qi wireless pad…the only reason I plug in is to get faster charging, so this is a failure.  2) Not enough USB C tips included.  This is the default now.  I’d like to see more of these.  2 type B would’ve been plenty.  3).  This is the dealbreaker:  The tips have a blue led light built in.  At night, it lights up the whole room.  I keep my charging cords mostly in the bedroom, and so I either have to plug something into all the cords, or unplug any unused cord each night, otherwise it is impossible to sleep.  Pain in the butt.  And if the cable becomes dislodged at night, which is easy if I fall asleep with the phone next to me in bed as the magnets aren’t that strong, it wakes me up.  I’ve stopped using them completely.
3.0 out of 5 stars;power ONLY no data transfer at all!!!;I was loving the cords I got then to connect my battery pack to my Quest 2 it was very convenient but when I went to transfer files from my PC to my quest 2 there is NO data at all only charging I'm very disappointed it says nowhere that they are power only and I didn't see any reviews stating thisBUYER BEWARE!!!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Can not connect my iPhone 12 Pro to car play;I like the cords, they have a solid connectionThe magnetic end only has contacts on one side so it will not charge unless it is inserted properly.  However after proper insertion I am unable to connect my IPhone 12 Pro to my 2018 Silverado HD pickup. Car play will not work. Phone will charge. When switching back to a conventional non magnetic cable car play will work.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Data transfer not supported for iphone;This cable works great for charging, but not for data transfer.  I found this out by accident when i couldn’t use the cable for Apple CarPlay in my car.  The cable for data transfer has to have the leads on both sides of the tip.  A couple of articles indicated “MFI certified” are the ones that will work.  I was really bummed as I like the magnetic connector with swivel.
1.0 out of 5 stars;HORRIFIED!!! DO NOT BUY CAUGHT FIRE!!!!!!!!! DANGEROUS PRODUCT;ordered two packs of these for my aunt, In the amazon box i received one  box of cords, and one package in a clear plastic bag. thought this was odd as the connector up links were different but thought nothing of it, i plugged the charger head into phone then plugged the cable into my computer to charge, the cord at the mate end to the phone promptly started smoking and catching fire. i pulled it from the computer but now my phone is acting odd, contacting amazon to get refund and to issue warning about it being a dangerous Product.  (see pictures for burn proof.)
3.0 out of 5 stars;Will not fast charge my steamdeck, what I bought it for, or my phone.;The cord lack power transfer.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Conjures ferrous dust out of thin air;For the price, really not all that bad. You get 2 of 3 sizes, plenty to go around. That being said, the charging ends of the whips are pretty easily broken, and they magically SUMMON THE MOST MAGNETIC DUST FROM THE AETHER! So when said dust gets between the charging tips, they do t connect very good. Kind of a pain to clean. Otherwise, not the best, not the worst.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Product is as advertised. A pleasant surprise.;The headline is the review.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Broke 2 of the ends and 1 cord so far in 3 months;The part that sticks into your device being magnetic isnt a great deal because it attracts metal filings to your charging port. I had hoped when i ordered it that the plug was just ferrous metal and the cord was magnetic. Anyways i also keep breaking the parts so not great overall, cool idea though.
4.0 out of 5 stars;great customer service;product was at first  great but after a little while proved unreliable at best
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not for data;Wife uses it. I needed data for my android auto. If you just want to charge. This works great.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Jokes on me;I’ve had these for about a week and right away one of the IOS charges was inoperable 1/4 no big deal I guess. Well then little by little having our phones in our pockets and whatever the piece that goes into the phone started cracking and breaking. On top of all that when they are charging anything they get sooo hot! Not sure what’s up with that. What at first seemed like a really bad ass concept turned into the biggest wast of money. I do not recommend these at all!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Slow to charge;Very slow to charge
3.0 out of 5 stars;It doesn’t work if you have a case on phone;The part that goes into the phone is too short to fit when I have my phone case on. If you don’t have a good phone case on there it will fit.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Mehhhh;Charges ok not a quick charge cable for sure. Charges about 400 - 800mA an hr. Depends if your using the phone then it's around 200 to 400mA
3.0 out of 5 stars;Great customer service- responded same day;Update: another cable stopped working intermittently. Great customer service- I wish the product was a little sturdier.One of the five cables stopped working properly- when I contacted the seller- they responded same day and sent a replacement part which arrived within 2 days- faster than the original order!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Magnet poor quality;The cords are great sizes , and the swivel is pretty good  , but the magnets don't hold up their strength for long within a day or two they loose their power.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Do Not use for tablets, Unless;I tested it for rechargeable led lights, cell phones and pretty much anything with mini usb connectors and 5 watt chargers.But.. The moment I tried it on a 4 year old iPad with a Anker Elite 24 watt charger the cord got very hot, and I mean Very hot including the swivel connector.This cord is constructed with fine, meaning very thin, wires and can not handle 24 watts safely and anything over 24 watts is an exponential risk.With a 10 watt or less charger the cords will be acceptable.If you have a USB C device I recommend looking for a mag adapter that fits on your existing USB C cord that is rated for powerful chargers. I would recommend one on amazon but it would be fare enough to simply recommend one and let you look for one with realistic reviews to match with it.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not the best;Great product but charges very slowly.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Contact area is too small;The cable wouldn't continue charging if the device was bumped or moved. Constantly went on and off charge mode. Needs to have a larger contact area.
4.0 out of 5 stars;is good;id good
3.0 out of 5 stars;6 ft Cords don't work well;The 6 ft cords aren't charging correctly. The 3 ft and 10 ft are working great.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Nice design;Love the design but connectors fall apart easily and too much resistance will not fast charge my phone.
5.0 out of 5 stars;no hunting for the right cord.;love them. one cord for all my charging needs
1.0 out of 5 stars;Burn;DO NOT BUY THESE!! I went to charge my LG phone and smoke immediately came from the end of the cord!! I immediately disconnected and touched the end with the tip of my finger and burnt my finger tip! The plastic part around the melted!! I immediately went around the house and cars and pulled out all of these bad cords!! Glad it didn't start a fire making contact with my chair or carpet!!!!!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Worked for a week before the lightning adapter stopped working.;The concept is great, but when the little adapter that goes in your device fails, it’s worthless. They send you tons of adapters, but only 3 lightning type. I have 2 Apple products I charge on a regular basis, so now I’m stuck with. I spare adapters if the other 2 fail on me. My window to return has closed so now I’m stuck with an inferior product. Not happy with this purchase. Can’t even contact the seller! 😡
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging but works;I brought this for fast charging and to not have to keep entering my charging port(to preserve the port). I don't plan to buy a phone for 3 years. It charges devices but it didn't solve my issue. I was too lazy to return it. Worth about $15 in all.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn’t work with Apple CarPlay;The good:The cords feel nice, the tips attach securely and there’s a satisfying click when the magnets connect.The bad:My biggest gripe is with the iPhone lightning plug. The plug only has contact points on one side, which means that there’s a certain way this has to be put into your phone. Not a huge deal, but because you can’t use half those contacts you can’t use some functions like CarPlay, which I personally use almost every time I get into my car.Oh and the round base may interfere with some phone cases.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Great quality & versatility. NOT for rapid charging;I think these chargers are excellent quality and the magnetic versatility is great. What they do not do is rapid charge. It takes a good 8 hours to charge from about 25% to full. If I need a quick rapid charge, I would have to pry the adapter out of my phone/case to be able to use a regular cord with my rapid charging box. Sadly, had to return because I need the rapid charge more than the versatility and strong design of these. Too bad, because I really do like them.
2.0 out of 5 stars;They're ok;My kids broke 2 of the wires within a month of buying these. I thought they'd be easier for them to use but at this point we've all stopped using them and they've lost most of the attachments. Obviously that's not the company's fault but these are just more gimmicky than I'd hoped. I stopped using one for my phone because about half the time I'd find that they didn't charge my phone at all.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Love love love!!!;These cables and adapters are the best thing for a household with multiple devices of all kinds. No more struggling to find the right charger for the device. I put the 1ft cable in my car and eliminated the additional cords we previously had to switch out with various devices.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Great concept, poor execution;This charges extremely slow to the point it's unusable. I love the look and the feel but unfortunately that's not going to cut it. Will be returning.
3.0 out of 5 stars;So close to great;I love everything about these cables, save for one thing. When charging a table or iPhone it stops charging randomly. It will stay connected a charge of the magnet connection is oriented correctly. It’s weird.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great customer service!;Charges great. I did have a couple of the tips break, but they replaced them. Thanks guys!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Wanted to love these but they are generally useless after several months;Bought these primarily for charging my tablet while I am using it. Certain apps designed primarily for phones use a portrait orientation that results in the side mounting power cord to press into me if straight line. I thought these hinged connection points would be a great compromise. Well after several months the cables will not feed a consistent charge. I don't know where the failure point is but that's irrelevant.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not actually helpful;"iPhone 13 Pro user.Pro's: Ample charging cables and adapters (lighting, Android, etc.)Con's: The Magnetic charging plug/adapter that inserts to the charging port of iPhone does not fit with a phone case.  I had to use scissors to cut pieces of plastic off my case in order to accommodate the insert.The insert also falls out easily, so phone stops charging (or the insert comes out when you attempt to disconnect the phone). In my vehicle the device frequently stops charging after about five minutes, probably due to connection being loose.Also, for my iPhone, the insert only works when inserted with the correct side facing the charging connection, it's not ""universal,"" despite fitting in both ways (so it's a 50/50 chance you plug it in the right way, if you don't know to look).When the plug stays in, and the device keeps charging, it's pretty great.  The magnetic attachment is very convenient and the little blue light on the end of the charging cable is great when I'm looking for it in the dark. Overall it's more stress than it's worth since I will probably wake up to my phone NOT being charged."
1.0 out of 5 stars;Excited, then disappointed.;I was very excited about these cords. I loved the length and the light on the end. I ESPECIALLY loved the swivel head on the cord. However, I was sorely disappointed when each cord stopped working within a few days. On Day 10, out of five cords, I'm down to my last one, and it's temperamental at best. I've tried each cord on multiple devices with both micro USB and USB C plugs. The most recent stopped working while charging a Bluetooth speaker.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Demora en cargar el teléfono;No carga rápido, demora demasiado, pero, sí es cómodo!
2.0 out of 5 stars;I love having a universal cord.;The grandkids (8 &10) are really enjoying these. The 8 y.o. likes to go “fishing”  for his phone… the magnetic tip grabs his android and he pulls it up.. The light helps them find the end in the dark. The tangle-free cord allows them to use their device while charging. I love that 1 cord charges every thing with the multiple tips that were included..  My daughter and I share a set - 3ft in the cars, 10ft in the family room and a 5ft in the bedrooms — we don’t have a multitude of chargers everywhere any more- all three tip-types have worked with our devices (Note: The “I-tip” for I-phone place copper-stripes face down for charging) When we did have a slight issue, customer service quickly took care of it for us. (1 year warranty plus you can buy the extended warranty for $2.99)
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works well;Works well. Only down side is that when you unplug the part that stays in your phone comes out if you pull it straight off. Just need to get used to unplugging.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Works OK but not great;We have been using these chargers for a few weeks now. They work OK but sometimes you have to pull them apart and let them reconnect several times to make sure they are charging at full speed. We use galaxy s21 ultras. If you're not watching the phone will sometimes say 10 hours till full charge. Disconnect and reconnect a couple times and the charge time will go to about an hour which is normal. Other than that they work OK
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good;Good
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not a fast charge!;Using a fast charging plug and it takes forever to charge!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Apple adapter won’t stay commented in charge port.;The apple adapter that’s included with this product does not stay connected and disconnects the charging process as soon as you try to use the device while charging. Also, if you have a case on your phone, forget about it.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Worked good for a few weeks and then lost efficiency;Can't recommend.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Great chargers;Might be a little slow to charge, and I wasn't able to get data to transfer, but still very handy.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Great, except...;They potential to lose the charging tip is too great. I lost mine.
3.0 out of 5 stars;NOT FAST CHARGING!!!;I WISH THE CABLE WAS FAST CHARGING. I WON'T RETURN IT, BUT I WON'T BUY IT AGAIN.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Didn't lazy very long for me;The braided cords and the magnets are nice and don't look cheap. But I've had mine for almost a month now and both of the longer cables starting having problems. They either charged very slow or didn't charge at all. Tried using different power blocks as well as plugging them directly into my PC's USB ports. After seeing all the other reviews I'm hoping that maybe I just received a faulty set.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Cool idea but charging capability is much too poor to recommend;Pro's:-Variety of connection types provided-360° rotation connections very cool-Braided cables provide better protection from damage-Variety of cord lengths-Lighted when connectedCon's:-Charging power is much too low. Not adequate for anything but very slow charging-Magnets don't hold well (pics of device being swung by cord are misleading)-Cool tech that doesn't live up to ideals
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not for CarPlay;Good designs, but doesn’t work with Apple CarPlay. Only charges phone.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Cool for stationary things, but not durable.;Cool concept, but not for everyday use. Does not do well with the wear and tear that happens to (my) phone.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging;The magnetic aspect of these cables works as advertised. They connect easily and don't seem to stop charging when swiveling. The major issue is they don't work with modern fast charging bricks. Every fast charger I've plugged them into had the same result. The cable light turns on for about 10 seconds, and then stops working. I've plugged these cables into low power USB chargers and they work fine.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Great idea but...;Awesome idea but it charges substantially slower than a normal Samsung charger but if you're not in a major hurry...works well
2.0 out of 5 stars;not car play compatible;"The media could not be loaded.
                



 It's a really cool idea and It charges well, but this does not work for Apple car play or android auto. that makes it 50% useless. if you have to pull the little dongle out every time you use your car, you might as well just use a regular cable all the timetried it with my samsung, and my wife's iPhone. disapointing, because otherwise it's really great"
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not a data cable;Be aware that it is not a data cable. You can not transfer data to any other devices, like a PC, or projector.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Wife can't use it w/o adapter, always where I left it.;Love the charger and simplicity, adapters are easy to lose so watch for them.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Downgrading, short-lived cables, was: Love these, have converted most of our cables;I'm downgrading these cables, since after a while, they quit charging. At first we could unplug them and they'd start working. now even that doesn't help. My husband still uses these, but the rest of us have gone back to our old cables to avoid the hassle.We've been replacing our charging cables with these when we can, because these magnetic cables make life so much easier. Not only do you not have to fish around to find the opening on your device - the magnet just snaps to it, you don't have to fish to find which of the many cables you have draped around at each charger has the correct end.I wish these types of cables would become the status quo. they make charger so much simpler.
2.0 out of 5 stars;There is an issue with the cable;When I attach a cable to my iPhone 11 and make a connection to my display on my 2019 GMC CANNON the maps don’t display.If I switch back to my old USB cable the maps do display.Do I stopped using this product.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Quality Product;So far it seems to be a quality product. I would recommend it especially for kids tablets.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Works when it wants to;Not very good!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not charging;I received several cords and tip’s yesterday and worked for a little while however it has quit charging. I have tried changing cords and tips to no avail!  Great idea crappy product
3.0 out of 5 stars;Swivel is stiff and magnet weak;Hard to keep attached while using device. Easy connection though.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn’t always connect;I have trouble with them always connecting to charge and have to replug them in quite often
3.0 out of 5 stars;I wanted it to be better;I really wanted this to work out and be a solution to all the cable/charging woes. Alas they did not last, the cords stopped working after just a few weeks of use. Disappointed
2.0 out of 5 stars;Quality;It worked well with my LG style 6 and charged it quick but when I used the cables with newer phones like Samsung s22 n Gen over 10 it would charge really slow n really heat up the phone. So it works well with older gens but not the newer gens n I'm bummed out because it would of been great if it did, I no longer use it due to the issues it causes me now
2.0 out of 5 stars;The cords that work;Great concept. Not all cords in pack work. Thought it was my charging block but I have tried some cords in multiple blocks with the same result. However the ones that work well are amazing. I have an android and my work phone is iPhone. One cord for both
1.0 out of 5 stars;Almost just ok;Won't charge my phone over 1%.  I'm 30 min in how.  The movement of the cable is cool but when my phone was off Samsung just gave me a problem with charge symbol.  Do not buy this product.  It's bad.
2.0 out of 5 stars;i want to like them more...;The lengths are great. The color is outstanding (love red!!). The little ends are great. Awesome that it had different kinds. The charging.... oh boy..... 3-8 hours to charge my phone? With the fast charge wall plug that the phone came with. Even tried different wall plugs. The short one is ok. 6 foot... not so much. I have the 10 for away and it only gets used when the person sleeps because it takes so long. I want to like them more but i can't.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Nice Concept Poor Execution!;Biggest issue I had was the magnet and  the associated swivel functionality- The magnet was strong enough to connect the cable to the plug but it would come unseated easily when swiveling.Also (advertised) fast charging did NOT work with these cables!- I saw manufacturer said the longer cables wouldn't work for fast charge (ok...I guess)- I also tried with shorter cables and no dice there either
5.0 out of 5 stars;These things are awesome!!;I will definitely be using these from now on, it's so awesome having everything on the same cord. My headset my phone my controller and so on. Love it
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not durable at all;Only used for short time and already have had 2 of the tips that go inside iPhone come apart , not durable at all
3.0 out of 5 stars;Powers only;This will not allow data transfer, only powers your device.
1.0 out of 5 stars;If I could put zero stars I would. Absolute waste.;I don’t even know where to begin.Out of the 5 chargers, only 3 worked right out the bag. Of those 3, 2 of them stopped working the same day. And the very last one worked for about 2 weeks.Magnet strength isn’t great. It’s decent as long as you don’t move or tug at all. *eye roll*Bottom line. Just don’t waste your money like I did. They’re not worth the time & frustration.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Does not work for 2019 Macbook Pro laptop;I liked these for our phones that use USB-C connections.  However, it totally drained my 2019 Macbook Pro laptop when I left it charging overnight.  So even though I like them, I won't be able to use them on the laptop. bummer.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Contact is not very good;Not easy to use, often insensitive to contact, often have electricity for a while, and no electricity for a while,
5.0 out of 5 stars;I love it.;Simple to use and the right price
3.0 out of 5 stars;Cords are good, the plugs not so much.;All of the plugs have failed in a fairly short period of time. Luckily the cords work with a few other brands of plugs that I have tried.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Possibly a waste;My fiancé and I absolutely love these chargers. They are so convenient and easy to use. (Plus nobody steals your charger) however the bits that go into the phone break so easy. Eventually you run out and have to buy more. It really sucks because it’s a definite waste of money. But when they do work they are amazing.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Very slow charging;Worked great for the first week or so, then the charging speed fell way off. Takes close to 5 hours to charge now, when it used to take about 1.5.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't support steam deck;Doesn't even reach 45w.... no matter the connections... I've used several different at this point... what a waste of money
1.0 out of 5 stars;Fire Hazard;Although the idea is great and it does work if you never move once you use them the joint that bends becomes faulty. The wire within will start to gray you will lose charging unless it’s bent back where the frayed wires touch… umm fire hazard if ever there was one. Now if you never move much or use the charger in a stationary position you shouldn’t have any problems quick to attach and release, but the idea is to be able to charge while using and the cord not be tangled. Otherwise a regular cord would work just fine. Beware yes they work but you could ruin your phone and or start a fire!
3.0 out of 5 stars;its Allright;the part that you plug into the phone it gets stuck in there were you have to pri it out with a knife
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not worth the money;Worked quite well for first 15 days, but then things started going wrong.  First: the strong magnetism weakened until just moving the device would dislodge the cable.  Second:  charging speed began to slow, growing worse over time.  Third: even with cable connected and indicator shows charge in process,  device would lose amount of charge under very light use.  Fourth:  charging process became unreliable where speed would change even when device was turned off.  Last night, using the last cable charging at all,  I left my tablet on charge and turned off.  In approximately 8 hours, level of charge only increased from 25% to 62%. I checked the level of charge after 2 hours to find an increase of 30% (55%), but after 6 more hours, the additional increase was less than 10%.Will be purchasing from a different manufacturer.  Very disappointed.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Cable failed after 2 weeks;Great connection for 2 weeks and then cable stopped working. Still worked with another cable so it was not the adapter. Was pleased with the product and a 5 star item until then. Now I give it a 2 star, waiting to see when the other cable fails...
4.0 out of 5 stars;Could be better;Having connection issues
5.0 out of 5 stars;Best versitile/functional charger!;Love not only the durability and function of the cord. The LED light at the end of the cable that lights up when not connected to the device, is a great help. The strength of the magnet far surpassed what I was expecting.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Hate that it comes off so easily;Don’t even bother trying to pick your phone up from the ground with the cord, it will detach AND when you want to detach the cord, it unplugs the little attachment causing it to get lost! Terrible.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Fast charging doesn't last;Great out of the box, but the swivel ends feel very fragile. They were perfect straight out of the box, but now a month later charging times are outlandish. If you use the phone while on the charger it just keeps at the current charge. If I plug it in at 60% it says charging time is 2 hours. After 2 hours it's only at 85% . Got what I paid for
3.0 out of 5 stars;Great idea;
1.0 out of 5 stars;Well, that didn't last long...;Several of the cables now don't charge properly due to the cheap wiring in the swivel tip. I was already disappointed that they didn't support fast charging... But that was my fault. But not working in just a few months of use? Horrible. The 10ft never workered right, now both 6ft are going out.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not high quality;The brick end of the charge is standard usb slot. Most of my current bricks are usbC now.Cable seems like it wouldn’t last long, but that’s just an impression.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charging;It charges so slow
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works perfectly as advertised;Super easy to use and works very well.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Short Term Solution;Some of the cords and clips work really well for short periods of time. We’ve gone through 2 boxes of cords and iPhone clips within a year. Initially, only about 3 clips actually worked out of 2 boxes with the cords. Every few months each cord goes bad. Cords aren’t frayed or worn either. They just stop working. At nearly 1 year after purchasing 2 boxes, every cord and clip is non functional. I encourage you to just buy the Apple cords that will work long term and save the hassle and waste of money.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not as good as they say;Always says slow charging, even tho they say they are suppose to be fast charging. Already have a cord not working. I tried different outlets & different plug in parts, but still wont charge my phone.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good;Good product. But magnetic end dose hold up very long
2.0 out of 5 stars;Do NOT work with my other cords!  All of my others have the button not a line connector.;These are unusable with my other cords so I gave them away!  If you have other cords check the connections carefully before ordering!!!
1.0 out of 5 stars;It doesn't work.;Cables stopped charging after few hours of use. I tried multiple time to change cable, adapter and source of power but I didn't get any positive result.
2.0 out of 5 stars;NO DATA CAPABILITY;I returned these as they do not have data capability and did not work with my android auto in the car. The magnetism was strong though! I could hang my phone in the air, by connecting the cord to the charger and hanging onto the cord. I also really liked the led light- it was covered when charging. Which was nice for sleeping. These would be perfect if they had data transfer ability.
5.0 out of 5 stars;I love these;I love these charging cords very easy to use and last longer because of the 360 turn
2.0 out of 5 stars;Disconnecting Cables;It will not stay charging my phone. I connect the two ends, the magnets connect and it charges for maybe 2 seconds then disconnects.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good;Good
3.0 out of 5 stars;Slooowwwwww charge;It works as advertised. The swivel head is nice.Im guessing there are so few strands going through the swizel that it cant pump in much juice.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Barely charging;The cords barely charge anything. After two hours my device was only 10% charged. My old charger would easily be at 100% after two hours.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Love these charges. They’re my fav.;Bought enough for me and my boys. I love how they come with all the different types you might need to charge anything.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not good;Do not like the product very well magnets fall off very easily.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charging!;It is good but slow charging for iPhone I test.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charging and doesn't support Android Auto or Apple CarPlay;It is nice and easy to use, a shorter cable would have been helpful but the biggest cons are:1. Slow charging2. Doesn't support Android Auto or Apple CarPlay
2.0 out of 5 stars;Don’t work;Plugged cables into wall out let. Have blue light at end of cable. Connect to iPhone 11 Pro and will not charge.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Works on Android;Works on android and our IPad but not on our IPhone.  Slow charging and doesn't work for data transfer
5.0 out of 5 stars;Kid proof;No more bent receiving plugs
2.0 out of 5 stars;The magnets are circle the y are wrong.;There’s reason to change from circle and I like better the shape is different then circle?
2.0 out of 5 stars;Magnet is too strong;Works but the magnet is too strong. It pulls the little plug out of the sticker on the phone. It could be that my phone is old. But it happens on new devices too.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not for fast charging;These cables are a simple hot wire and ground. They cannot perform fast charging even with fast charging adapters.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Works for some phones but not all it seems;Wonderful concept.  Worked fine on my wife's Samsung Galaxy Z-flip 3.  The connector wouldn't stay in my phone (Galaxy Note 20 5G).  So I'm still looking for something that works for my phone.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Activity avoid;Product did not work at all. The connection was either not strong enough or not connecting at all. I tried all the cords and there was no power being sent to the phone.
2.0 out of 5 stars;IPhone compatibility issues;Worked great at charging the first week.  Then started having issues with our iPhones not recognizing when the cable was connected to charge.  Now they are completely unusable as regardless of what charging device is used it creates a power surge warning when attempting to charge.  We tried changing the charging adapter etc. but nothing works. Our IPhones are older models so I can’t to speak with compare with newer iPhones.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Good cable, strong magnet but average usb device connectors;The magnet connection is nice and strong but it keeps pulling out the usb connector  from the device you are charging when you are disconnecting the cable.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Two of the usb c broke upon 1st use but cables are great;Watch for connectors breaking but great cable
3.0 out of 5 stars;Cool connections;These are very cool how they connect…but they disconnect very easily…so my phone wasn’t charging at night. 😢
2.0 out of 5 stars;Garbage, slow charging and very unstable...;This cord doesn't support fast charging and comes unstuck from the tip way too easily.  Almost any movement brings it unstuck, a lot of the time without you even noticing, making the slow charging all the more painful.  Great idea in theory, not so much in practice.  Save yourself the aggravation, don't buy this product.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Broken after 3 months;So I got this magnetic charger cord in January and loved how convenient it was to charge my Samsung s20+. It wasn't the fastest charger and took considerately longer to charge using it versus a regular charging cord but at least I didn't have to insert the charging cord into the USB c socket in the darkFast forward 3 months and the magnetic piece that is attached to the cord had broken off. It's actually a little pivot point that I suppose is the weak part of it's construction. The attached pictures shows an intact cord and the second one shows the piece that broke off. I tried to reattach it but I was unsuccessful.I don't think I'd get this again.
2.0 out of 5 stars;They work.  Meh;They are exactly  as they say they are. They work. But if you are expecting  it fast charge your phone like  the cord that comes with your phone. Don't buy this. My phone is at 68 % and will take 1.75  hrs to fully charge. But like I said they work. So meh.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Very Disappointed;Started out ok, but started heating up repeatedly at the connection point. I’ve stopped using it afraid it will damage my iPad.
1.0 out of 5 stars;It completely sucks.;It keeps losing connection. Did not come with a brick. Lots of tips I have no use for. After an hour the percentage of power hasn't increased.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Well made. Good collection of lengths and tips in small boxes.;These are rare magnetic cables WITHOUT externally visible light (it lit only on the inside of the magnet ring, when disconnected. The cable is soft, connectors are compact.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Inserts magnets fall off;the cord is great and charging works well however, the inserts magnets doesn't stay on. Once they fall off that's it. Will try different brand next time.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Magnetic are not shock proof;Any type of drop can dislodge or crack the magnetic from its base. Mostly the adapter, charging cord has no real issue.
1.0 out of 5 stars;These are horrible;A little magnetic inserts burnt out and almost burnt out the charger on my iPhone
1.0 out of 5 stars;Bad. Don’t Buy;Don’t Buy. They changed the pin length so it will not connect power with there old adapter. Forcing you to change (ALL) your adapters. Anything to make a new sale.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Chargers;Don’t work!
3.0 out of 5 stars;The first time I bought magnetic cords that didn't include the tips;This is the first time I bought magnetic cords that didn't include the tips.  I love the short magnetic cords, but the tips should always come with them.  I happen to have enough, but that can't be assumed.  The cords without the tips have no function.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charging....;I got these because I liked the swivel. Well they only do slow charging. It's a complete waste. How can it take this long to charge a phone already at 63%
1.0 out of 5 stars;Broke;Never even used one of them
2.0 out of 5 stars;You get what you pay for. Very slow at charging. Had to go back to my old charging system.;Make Sure of this before you purchase. 1) Do you have wall adapter,  2)If you don't have adapter it is a separate purchase. 3) Are you okay with slow charging? Otherwise you may be disappointed.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Don't bother...;Cables are proper length as advertised but that's about it. Swapped out my OEM cable for these and charging was significantly slower. Magnets are no where near what they're showing you in strength of magmatism. Tip built up heat quickly and I removed immediately as not to damage my phone. Even tried other tips and other lengths just to make sure I'm not imagining. Swivel joint is cheap and clearly won't last long. Do yourself a favor and get better cables that fast charge and avoid these. Will be returning for full refund.(I read a bunch of reviews and have to say, anyone who rated these 5 stars is clearly a paid reviewer or bot)
1.0 out of 5 stars;Didn’t work;These seemed like a great idea but they don’t work. They get power but do not charge.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Broken after 2 weeks use;Product works and the magnet is strong however the attachment broke after a couple weeks of use. I haven’t dropped my phone, works but not sure how long my tips will last.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Terrible for charging;Doesn’t charge well. Falls off all the time. Cool design but needs more work
2.0 out of 5 stars;Poor charge;Not a very good charge with these
1.0 out of 5 stars;Except that the iPhone tips don’t work it’s great;The iPhone tips don’t work
1.0 out of 5 stars;Great idea poor execution;Lightning plugs have to be plugged in a certain way 🤦🏻‍♂️ pretty obnoxious in the dark haha over all wish they were a bit stronger. The swivels take a bit of breaking in which leads to lost tips and cables coming disconnected.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Failed much to quickly;Stopped working within week.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Hit or Miss with Connectivity - NO MAC SYNC;"Hit or mis with charging.  Have to find the ""Sweet spot"" with the direct iphone connection as well as USB-C.  Pulling in/out the connector to get charging.  Another large downfall is the Mac will not recognize for sync.  These are ONLY FOR CHARGING, NOT FOR DATA."
1.0 out of 5 stars;No Fast charging;"The cable does NOT support Fast charging.  Tried with the magnetic cable that is 3 years old and my phone clearly says ""Fast charging"".  Once this cable is in, it charges at the slowest speed.  The concept of the cable (rotating head and light on the inside, not the outside is very good but not being able to charge at faster speed is very disappointing)"
1.0 out of 5 stars;Almost started a fire;While playing a game on my iPad, I was charging it up. I had used these cables several times to charge my iPad over the last several days without incident…until today. While holding my iPad, I noticed the charging port felt warm, then a few seconds later, it became very hot. Hot to the point that I could no longer hold my finger near the port. I pulled the cable immediately! There appears to be no permanent damage.  Also, I was unable to use these cables to charge my iPhone. I found several fittings that would insert into it, but none would recharge my phone.  This is a very dangerous system. Avoid at all costs!!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Poor charging;It worked at first and I love the length but it started to not charge my phone but keep it at the same percentage that I put it on before I went to bed. It sucks cause it's a cool charger but I can't use it if it won't work.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Needs to be more powerful than this its hours before a full charge worthless;Didn't like the charge its slow even on a fast power cube worthless.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Does not work;Don’t bother buying this. It does not work on iPhone and items that require higher power. Charging a small mouse is probably ok. Waste of time.
1.0 out of 5 stars;The miracle is that this is being sold;Used on my iPad 3:  The charging was intermittent.  The magnet worked well.  The charging went off and on without being touched at all, 2 to 4 times a minute.  I reversed the plugin, and then it would not charge at all.  I tried using it to charge my iPhone 7 plus, and the magnetized plug-in freely slid in and out of the charging slot of the phone without even touching the contacts.  I have never seen that happen with any charger before.  The magnet is the only fully functional part.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Great idea, Lousy performance.;"Using an original Samsung smart charger and Galaxy S20+ I get the message, ""To charge faster, use the charger and cable that were provided with this phone."".I used a USB tester which measures volts and amps. With the phone at 93% charge I got the following results:Aftermarket direct cable: 8.54v, 0.86-0.98ACompetitor mag connect: 8.43v, 0.86-0.91AThis item 3': 4.63v, 0.14A & 4.83v, 0.39AThis item 6': 4.8v, 0.29A & 4.67v, 0.29AThis item 10': 4.67v, 0.17AI really wanted to like this product, but it is unusable for my purposes."
1.0 out of 5 stars;Didn’t last;It broke pretty fast. The bending part on the top that connects to the magnet broke off randomly of two out of the pack and no idea how or why. After over 3 months of usage
1.0 out of 5 stars;Disappointed product;Garbage.  Takes forever to charge phone.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Worst item ever!;I thought at first it was the coolest idea, but after I received it, I learned I was completely wrong. It sucked the life outta my battery.. I could never get the damn thing to charge past 30% even having it on all night long... don't get it... waste of money and phone battery
2.0 out of 5 stars;Charging is slow;It wont keep up charging my ipad while using.  I switch to the iPad changer or ipad cord with my battery pack and it charges without issue while using.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Broke less than 2 weeks of use;The end broke off when I was trying to disconnect my phone from the charger, just a tiny tug needed to separate the magnetic connection. Amazon support would not send me just one new cable, so all of them are being returned. Which is a hassle and not cost effective, but I guess that's what happens when products aren't vetted. Super disappointed. Will not buy this brand again.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Terrible! Does not charge at all!;Update!! I have now gotten six emails to remove my review! I’m not sure if they are spam or not! However, I will not be removing my review! This is terrible, honestly if I still had the box I would return it. It doesn’t charge my phone at all. I tried not touching the phone while it was charging and that didn’t even work. Basically the only way to charge the phone was to hold the charger in place. Do not purchase this item.
1.0 out of 5 stars;DO NOT BUY!! I REPEAT DO NOT BUY!;DO NOT BUY!! I REPEAT DO NOT BUY!  We have only used for only 2 mo and almost caught my son’s tablet on fire.  Melted the connector and started to melt/burn the tablet cover!!!  We smelled burning plastic and caught it before it did further damage fortunately!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Don't waste your money!;Everyone's milage may vary, but over the product is made poorly. Ends don't last but more than a few weeks of use.At first everything seemed great. But after a few months, all of the devices don't recognize the charging cables at all. Don't waste your money.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Good but only came with 3 cables;Missing 3 cables + one of the boxes was already opened
1.0 out of 5 stars;Pretty much useless unless you want to change all your charging locations to use this device.;Probably great if you had a set of this everywhere.I have 5 normal charging places I use, and this covered only one.Car, Bedroom, Kitchen, Office, other car.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Keeps breaking upon connecting;For some reason when I connect the magnetic cable the attached keeps breaking. I’m not sure if it’s cheap super glue, but this is not convenient at all. Maybe it’s just mine that’s manufactured badly
1.0 out of 5 stars;Get’s Hot. Apple Won’t Recognize.;Two Apple phones: an iPhone 13 and an iPhone 11. One Apple iPad Pro. None of these devices recognized the charge at all. Simply would not charge my Apple devices. Also, mind you while NOT charging, gets very hot.It very slowly charges my E-Ink device, but not worth the money. Find another product!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn’t work on IPhone 13 Pro Max;The cords looks very sturdy and I was very excited when my order was delivered, but unfortunately even though it says it works with smartphones it doesn’t on my IPhone 13 Pro Max.  The tips are either way to big or way to small.  Very disappointed.
2.0 out of 5 stars;They are alright....;Nice idea and they look great, but 2 of the cords are dead. They do not work, and of course they are the cord lengths that you would use the most. I would NOT buy again!!!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Don’t waste your money;It will take forever to charge and will not work in one month
1.0 out of 5 stars;BUYER BEWARE;These DO NOT WORK. I'm glad I tried them before boarding a plane to Central America tomorrow where I would have had no way to charge phones or pads. I tested all of them with multiple devices and outlets. no functionality whatsoever. Unless you really, really want a bunch of cords with weak magnets and tiny blue lights at the end, forget about buying these. Nice to get the different insets, but when none of the cords work it renders the item completely worthless. Thankfully Amazon has a super easy return process!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Won’t stay in phone.;The part that goes in my phone pulls out of my phone every time I go to take the charger off. Completely defeats the purpose. I’ve used these kinds of chargers since I got this phone and this is the first time I’ve have this issue. I tried all of the different plugs that came with the product. Highly disappointed with the fitment.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Magnetic plugs fall out;The magnetic ends that plug into my iPhone will not stay plugged in…especially if you pull the cord to disconnect them.  They also don’t plug in deep enough to charge the device without holding pressure on them.  These tips fall out often then the search is on!  Very disappointed and dissatisfied
1.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped working..;I liked the product at first. I purchased 2 sets so 10 cables. I found a few of the cables overheated, after it overheated, one worked after I set it aside for a few days but then stopped.  Now, of the 10 cables, only 2 works.  The others connect but then the equipment would say “Not Charging” after half a minute.  I gave up on all of them and reverted back to the old cables.  Tempted to reach out to get a refund.. but it’s a little over a month now.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Glue;The glue that holds the magnet onto the connector on the little pieces you ply into your divine could be better. I’m down to one more IPhone connector out or two packages I bout. Maybe a weld would be better.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Takes all night to charge my phone 50% through this cable;I was excited by the swivel head on these cables and have used the magnetic cables for years. I love them. These cables won't pass enough electricity through them to charge my phone. I have tried different plug heads and the cables work on none of them. I threw them away. They are worthless.
1.0 out of 5 stars;JUNK;Good thing it includes multiple cables, because you’re lucky if each lasts you a month. And even when they’re “working”, they will randomly stop charging occasionally until you fiddle with the connection. This is straight up cheap junk. I have bought more effective phone chargers at the dollar store.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Looks nice, but cheaply made!;Product worked out of the package, but quickly fell apart, the charging magnetic end completely came away from the cord exposing the “Hot” leg of the cord. Dangerous for fire and shorting the device out.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Muy practico!!!!;Excelente y practico
1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn’t transfer data;This cord will charge my phone. But it doesn’t  transfer data.  I ordered this cord to use it in my car.  To make it easier to snap it into my car.  The cord charges my phone.  But it doesn’t work with google maps.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not compatible with any Data;Doesn't work with Apple Carplay or Android Auto. System only works when you only use their charging cables.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Definitely not a good buy;Only had this for a little over a week, already stopped working… down to the last two cables and I’m sure those will go out just as fast. Poorly made, ya get what you pay for
1.0 out of 5 stars;Stops working after a few weeks;The magnet is a cool trick but the charging is not consistent and fails to charge when connected after a few weeks of use
2.0 out of 5 stars;Easily broken;One of the ends came out after two uses.
1.0 out of 5 stars;It doesn’t hook up to Apple car play, otherwise it’s good. W;It doesn’t hook up to Apple car play, otherwise it’s good.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charge/cord tip breaks easily;Three days past return window....the Tip pops off the cord, so it's unusable junk.Plus, Three of the other cords have a really slow charge. Painfully slow. Do not recommend.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Dont buy;Grass grows faster than these cables can charge a battery.  Wouldn't even charge a battery over night.  Tested pn multiple phones.  Some batteries lose charge with these cables.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Really cool. But NO support, falls apart;Loved it but most of cables already stopped working after 2 months!!!!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Sadly…no :(;I was so excited for this but sadly I got it and it didn’t work for me but it came with a lot of items for a good price it will not even charge my phone at all
1.0 out of 5 stars;Meh…;They DO NOT transfer data for iPhone. Only provides charge. They DO NOT fit into 7/10 of my devices due to the round magnetic end preventing the plug from inserting into your device far enough. If you don’t need data transfer and you only want them to fit into a couple (if any) of your devices, they are fantastic :-(
2.0 out of 5 stars;Devices with protective cases may impede functionality;Did not allow proper charging
1.0 out of 5 stars;Does not work with phone case;Does work with phone case. Plug is too short
1.0 out of 5 stars;Do not buy.;I just opened this charger and it already stopped working. Not even an hour into charging my phone it stopped. Hoping I can return it.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Broken within a week;Terrible broken from normal use in a week
1.0 out of 5 stars;Poor quality tippers;Tippers poor quality broke in half. The cord was ok. I wouldn't recommend this product. No point in buying a warranty. All they want to do is refund you.
1.0 out of 5 stars;These cables DO NOT support fast charging;These cables DO NOT support fast charging
1.0 out of 5 stars;Won’t transfer data;Won’t work in my car for Apple car play & doesn’t charge on most outlets. Piece that plugs into phone only works in one direction frustrating. Pass on this I wish I did but reviews said it was ok but it’s clearly not!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Your Phone may over heat!;I bought the charging cables because I have many devices that use different charging cables and it would make charging them easier. However, it made my cell phone over heat. I don't know why but it did. So be careful.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Ugh...;Cords are very delicate. Both C dongles fell apart, as the soldering pulled free on both of them, rendering the charger useless for me.I can't recommend these, unfortunately.
1.0 out of 5 stars;adapters don't fit i-phone;"Despite the claim that these cords would work with ""i-products,"" none of the dozen or so adapters supplied fit my iPad Air or my iPhone 11."
1.0 out of 5 stars;Failed in a little over a month!;It failed in normal service in my truck.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Won’t work with a protective case on;It’s an okay charger but you can’t charge your phone without taking your case off of your phone. Pain in the butt in my opinion.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn’t stay plugged in;Falls out constantly
1.0 out of 5 stars;Absolute garbage;Absolute garbage. Will not charge anything. Tried on my LG v60 and my iphone. Nothing. Don't waste your money
1.0 out of 5 stars;Love the idea, just charges slow.;Charging is very slow
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not worth it;Only received 4 of the 5 cables and didn’t receive any of the charging tips.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Junk;Doesn't work on iPhone XR
3.0 out of 5 stars;Magnetic heads hard to remove;These seemed like a great idea but the magnets are not strong enough to pull the magnetic head out of your phone port and if you use a case with your phone it can be quite difficult to remove the magnetic head without taking off the case. Which is a major inconvenience and the reason I'll be looking for something better suited to my needs. Otherwise the design is great.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Carga lenta.;Su carga es muy lenta.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Bad connection;Without pressing hard against the magnet to phone . It wouldn’t charge
1.0 out of 5 stars;Don't waste your money;Flimsy. Adapters don't stay in, charging power is minimal.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Don’t Buy;Only one of them worked.  Had to return.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Work well for Android, but not for Ipad,;"For my Android phone I leaqve the adapter in and just put the cable near it and it connects anc charges it everytime. My iPad, I have to connect it multiple times before it will actually charge, Sometimes the ipad gives a ""device not compatible"" message, other times it says not charging up in the top. I finally stopped using it for the iPad and went back to a normal charging cord and have not had any problems since."
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not charging;Looks good, magnet is strong, but slight movement and it stops charging while still connected. Very annoying.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Crap;Bought March 28th. Broke on May 10th.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Magnetic tips were not included and missing 1 charger cord;My package did not come with any magnetic tips and 1 6ft cord missing. Disappointed. Now I'm gonna have to buy magnetic tips. Boo
1.0 out of 5 stars;It will not charge my phone;I have an iPhone 11 and it will not charge with these cables
1.0 out of 5 stars;Dident work as listed;The attachment would not stay in my phone and would not chatge my phone eather =(
1.0 out of 5 stars;Garbage;Garbage
1.0 out of 5 stars;Type C;Disappointed it didnt work with my Type C samsung phone. The other pieces worked fine.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Shows metal housing on cable - Missing;This is cheap crap
1.0 out of 5 stars;not charging at all;Lots of connectors, and many cables. very fancy. but it is not charging my iphone, neither charge ipad. useless.
1.0 out of 5 stars;SUPER SLOW CHARGING;Find a faster charging cable
1.0 out of 5 stars;I bought this a few months ago now it stop charging my phone;Never buy again just stop working.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesnt work with case.;Doesnt work with case on.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Did not receive what was advertised;This only came with half of the products it claimed was included in the set.Disappointed with the deception.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Don’t send data only charges!;I like the concept but it doesn’t fit phones etc. with cases… also it only charges no data transfer. Can’t be left In phone port it mutes the phone. It gets very het at magnetic connections. It just needs a lot of fixes lol.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Great Concept, poor quality;My son bought these.  They worked great at first but within a couple of months, the cord magentic end came out of the cord and would not charge.
4.0 out of 5 stars;So far so good;I like using one cord for both C and micro devices.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Love this product...;"Very easy to use, Love that it ""glow's"" when it's dark. Have had this item for 2months now and no problems. I actually just ordered a few more...✌️"
3.0 out of 5 stars;Super convenient but they don't last any longer;"As much as I love these and will continue to use them simply because my phone is always plugged in due to gaming my charging port gets Extreme use. That said the magnetic plates have a nickel coating on them and over time as the wire twists back and forth it wears down this coating and the plates no longer make a sound connection if you're charging small devices this is not a problem "" I use the old worn out nipples for charging flashlights and Bluetooth speakers and such"" but for a phone that needs quick charge my phone will die even while plugged in even if I'm not gaming the charge is so slow that it takes all night to completely recharge the battery with the phone off the moment I replace the nipple with a fresh one I no longer have that problem. The nipples last about 3 months and you can buy them in packs of 6 for a decent price however the cables need to be replaced as well but not nearly as often especially if your usage is being split between multiple wires they should last roughly a year"
1.0 out of 5 stars;Does Not Stay Connected;Does not charge phone due to not staying connected.  Unless I held it with pressure could not keep the connection.  Quite disappointing!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Buenos cables pero conectores débiles.;Es una buena idea pero se nos han roto los conectores a todos en casa. Se depegan los imanes con un par de usos.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Worked great at first. No longer working.;Worked great at first but now the charging icon goes off within seconds. No longer charging. Going back to old cords. How disappointing.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Only type C  tips work.;"The micro USB tips will not fit Anything.  I wanted to charge my small tablet but all 4 tips won't fit. I tried them All in several items and do not fit. I use the type C tips for other items and they work great. Would Really like something to work. Otherwise it's a decent amount of money for just 4 tips. Gave my son a cord with the iPhone tips since I don't use iPhone. They are Not working for him. Amazon customer service originally offered a full refund. Called today to ask where refund is so I can replacethe non working things. Some guy I can barely understand says he will give me $5.00. OMG I finally hung up on him. Wouldn't even look up the previous call to read for himself what the other rep. told me. I can't replace the items for 5 dollars. Returned item March 25th today id April 5th and it still is ""on it's way""."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Excited for magnetic charging!;Had looked at this option for over a year now and finally decided to bite the bullet.Watched several YouTube reviews and found this brand to have received the best reviews, outside of the “incentivized” reviews on Amazon.It came in a nice box with magnetic knubs in protective plastic containers. I went ahead and installed two of the (4) lightning knubs on my iPhone X and iPad. The cables seems very sturdy and the led charging ends easy to spot under no light conditions. So far, iPad is charging nicely. I have a QR charging base for my iPhone and that knubs doesn’t seem to affect the wireless charging whatsoever!Will update this review in a month or so!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Does not work with apple car play;I bought these because my charging port is at the point where I have to either hold my phone in a certain angle or lay it flat carefully while charging. With these I’m more free to use my phone while charging without it disconnecting. Unfortunately I can’t use them in the car because they don’t work with Apple CarPlay. I tried with 3 different cables and heads but won’t work. All in all they’re very thin, the joint that bends is cheap plastic so I guess we’ll see how long these work for but I’m happy so far after a week.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Quick charge 3.0? Not Here;Product is great 👍 I really like the fact that u can just bring it close to the cell and connects and if I pull it it disconnects ... BUT if I pull it to the sides is easier to disconnect properly and If I pull it out straight then the whole thing disconnects .... and only work for regular charging I have quick chargers and my phone would not take quick charge when I'm using this cord .... so ill have it as a back up .... I still like it I could return it but I won't
3.0 out of 5 stars;The plug in adapter don't stay in.;The adapter plug in don't stay inside the phones input and the magnetic pulls them out. It has no grip. But fortunately my old magnetic adapters were made the same and they have good grip and don't get pulled out by the cord magnet. I would not buy again because they don't stay in the phone.  The magnets work but are pointless because they pull the adapter out of phone.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Recommend if you only need cable!;I really like the turnaround the cords can do. The magnetic is strong, I even successfully get my phone from under the seat in my car, using this cable and the old tip I still have!Note: the tips, in another hand, are not really good. It’s so easy to be remove from a device! 9 out of 10 times I try to unplug, the tip come out of my device, stick strongly to cable!
5.0 out of 5 stars;I only use these now.;I have the little charging nubs plugged into all my devices so I can use any device on any cable, it is extremely useful and no more destroying cables via bending the ends of them. Comes with MANY different cable lengths.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great deal!  Saves your port.  Love them!;Fast shipping.  Really nice, great quality cords. I always seem to be in a situation where I have to use my phone while it's charging, I ruined a phone doing that so I was very happy to see these!Thank you!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good charger;Works well fast charging I did have to superglue the plastic cover that goes over the hinge since it kept sliding down and the metal pin in the hinge almost fell put
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good Value - No Carplay;First off I’m unhappy that this doesn’t support CarPlay but I also blame Apple for that in some measure.On to the good. Magnetic chargers or great for a multitude of reasons and these are definitely the best bang for your buck. The multiple tips make charging any device simple. The helpful LED lets you fine your cable in the dark. 4/5 wish they’d mention the CarPlay features not working. Also wish it’s came with another 10 foot, but I can’t complain as it’s already a great value.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Charging Cable;I used to charging cable to charge my phone all night long. My phone only has 10 percent battery. It doesn't charge my phone at all. Also, my phone is very hot too.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Best charging cords!;I am an all-time world-class klutz. I am constantly dropping my phone and tablet and breaking my cords' male charge prong thingy (I have no idea what the technical term is for it). The swivel had and magnetic attachment mean that it is nearly impossible for me to damage my cords! I l❤ve these cords! I'm getting them for the entire family!
3.0 out of 5 stars;The metal gets really HOT;I burnt myself a few times on the metal part of the charger where the magnet it attached. The whole piece gets  so hot that I was afraid to leave them unattended in case it was a fire hazard. I wish they could fix that, because it was such a good design otherwise.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Wish I had delved deeper into the specs for this cable.;5V max. When most charging now requires 15V, this cable doesn't compare. Slow charge times for the newer phones make it painful in the car and will sometimes cause your phone to shut off when it is connected to power. Great for the headphones and other products that don't require the more dedicated power.
1.0 out of 5 stars;A bit disappointed!;The quality is terrible!  The magnetism is very poor and it is easy to fall off!  It often fails to charge and needs to be reconnected!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Not if you need it to connect android auto to your cars my link;Wanted to give these a try because I like the idea of the magnet. However when plugging it in in my car I could not get android auto app on phone to connect to my chevys my link. Put my regular cord back on and it works just fine.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Misleading video;Is not able to hold the phone like in the video and kind of comes off easily
4.0 out of 5 stars;Amazing product but bad shipping;The charger is great and is so much better than normal chargers however it ships in the products original package with just a label on it and the box is torn.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Great idea, poor construction.;They worked well at first. 2 months in, phone at 80%, charging time showed 3hrs 15 mins until fully charged.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Keeper;My daughter loved it, she shared with boyfriend also.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Awesome Product at First Sight 👀... with one drawback (imo)... durability remains to be seen...;My only complaint has to do with the bright blue light at the magnetic end of each cable. While I'm glad that the led light is hidden while the cable is magnetically connected to the phone, it sucks that it is so bright when it is not connected. Terrible since I get up very early and need to grab my phone (which is my alarm clock) but my wife would still like a dark room to sleep in for the net 3 or so hours. 90% less bright would be adequate to let me know that there's power to the cable. It's really the only thing that would compel me to search for something different. Also might be a negative if keeping it in a vehicle. Other than that I really like these... read on.Compared to other magnetic chargers I looked at on Amazon this round style magnetic charger tip works perfectly with my phone case on... no need to mod it or anything. With so many usb powered/rechargeable gadgets in my life I might consider buying another complete set or at least another set of the tips (usb-cc and mini, not an i-phone user) if I can't find something better led light wise. These tips not only keep your device from failing due to a bunged-up/worn-out charging port (what killed my last, otherwise perfectly good, phone) it also prevents dirt and debris from getting into the port.  And again, it does NOT interfere in any way with me using the case or the clip holster it rides in all day long. Plan is to just keep the tip in the phone 24/7.Amazing bang-for-the-buck with all you get here. The variety of lengths are not necessarily what I would pick but at least there is a variety. Would trade the long one for another 3 or 6 footer. I didn't knock off stars over this since the product is as stated.The rotating magnetic cable end is really convenient but is also my main concern as far as it being the weak link in the system. Tiny little moving parts on a cheap import product.  Need to keep my expectations realistic as to how long before these cables fail. If this happens sooner rather than later I'll try and pop back here and revise my rating. But for now I'm Loving It-5 Stars if not for the overly bright led.I can't answer to the complaints of some of the i-phone users. 90% of what I need these for is usb-c and the rest are a few old style mini usb devices that are still hanging around.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good for people who kill charging cords;Things I love:I can use my phone while charging without destroying the cord.The magnetic connection keeps me from accidentally ripping a cord from my phone when I absent-mindedly walk away while connected.The magnetic cord can be “stuck” to metal to keep the end from falling on the floor when not in use.The cords are sturdy and come in a variety of lengths.Things I don’t love:I thought it didn’t work with my iPhone at first because the little bud that plugs into the phone is not bi-directional. If it doesn’t work at first, flip it around.It doesn’t “do” data for the iPhone, so my computer engineer husband had to essentially install Wi-Fi in my car in order to connect to it while charging. I wouldn’t have gone through the effort, but he loves solving puzzles. I don’t know whether it does data for the other types of connectors.Aside from those two things, I am enjoying using these handy cords.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Excellent product;Good product and use able 100%
3.0 out of 5 stars;Magnetic USB Type-C Adapter Broke after only 2 weeks of use .;One the Magnetic Adapters on a USB Type-C Broke after only two weeks of use . Half of the Magnet broke off one of the Magnetic Adapters. The charging Cords as well as the other Magnetic Adapters are working just fine .
5.0 out of 5 stars;Easy use.;Quick connect.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Works but...;Seems to work okay but will not work with Android auto or Apple carplay
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good solid set.Great for the price.All sizes you'll probably ever need.;I really like that the magnets are strong. All sizes work for rapid charging. Wish they did data too, but for the price you can't have it all. My only issue was that one of the tip's chrome chipped and wouldn't condut power..but there's no sign of that on any other. It was probably from too much use. But overall, after months of use of all cords and tips great stuff.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Very bad;This phone charger cable doesn't work for my phone at all. I don't know if it's broken. Its packaging is very simple and even dilapidated. I didn't expect that the quality of the things is so poor and the price is not cheap. How could I buy one of these things? it's speechless.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Very versitile;Makes charging very easy
5.0 out of 5 stars;Awesome;Awesome
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good;Good
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great product;Great product and easy to use
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works;Works great, but.. it sucks when you work in metal factory.. keep an can of air.. once you blow it off it works like it should..
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good deal for the price.;This doesn't support fast charging nor does it connect Apple Carplay or Android Auto in my car, and those are my only issues. Apart from that, it materials are great, and they're very styling and good looking. I especially like the blue light on it. Helps me to find the cord at night. Lol!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Got hot;Felt hot within a few minutes. Phone kept saying use charger for faster charging and wouldn't charge. Magnet wouldn't hold as described either.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Love the idea of this but...;More convenient.  The cable is floppy though. The magnetic connector is nice and works...sort of.  One cable is defective and one of the connectors is defective.  Great idea but a bit fragile.
5.0 out of 5 stars;So far it's 100% as advertised;Magnets will pick up a Galaxy S10+Fits in the rectangular slot on 2 different cases.Fast charge works.Cords seem to be of good quality.Led lights work.Swivel seems to be of good quality.Shipping was fast.Packaged nicely.Priced great.
5.0 out of 5 stars;💕 in love 💕;I absolutely love these I bought a set for everyone as Christmas presents
1.0 out of 5 stars;faulty on arrival;the product just didn’t work, none of the cables or the magnetic charger ports worked. had to get a return.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Charge Only;Just a charge only cord. Does not carry data, wish their where more details about this product before I bought it. It does one thing and one thing well and that is charge.
5.0 out of 5 stars;So useful;This is probably the most useful thing ive purchased on amazon. The magnetic tips all me to switch between devices without unplugging so i dont damage my ports
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not useful;This charger technically works, but the functionally is so unnesscary. It is hard to detach from the charging port, and is not useful. I rather use the original charger
3.0 out of 5 stars;Does not charge. Try again!;Purchased this because I like cool tech and while it is only a magnetic charging cable it is a pretty cool concept that missed it bullseye.I’m using an iPhone 11 Pro w/ IOS 15.3 and when connected to charge, no matter which cable I use or male piece, my phone will charge for 1 second then stop and then charge again and so on and so forth.Changed out the power adapters, connected to 2a and 5a plugs and still no luck.Cool tech. Lots of goodies and plugs. Wish this worked out. Smart design but looks & feels fragile.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Work great! One cord all different sizes of ends!;One cord and all different sizes of ends. No more drawers full of different sizes! Works great, no tangled or damaged ends! Rotating end.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Es lo que parece;Es comodo
4.0 out of 5 stars;Flexibility in charging;Would have given 5 stars but cannot get android auto to work using it.  Therefore I can't use my phone as sat nav when using it.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Only 3ft;Really good product but you only get 5 3 feet cables.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Recomend a different set;Instead of this set, I'd recommend this (fully compatible) TOPK set with more cables, including TWO long L-shape (right-angle) cables:  https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B094V9VXTFThese work just fine, but the straight, non L-shape cables lose their connection briefly whenever you tug on the cable just a bit.  That's why I'd go with the above set.  Anywhere you're going to be using your phone/tablet while it's plugged-in, I'd stick with L-shape cables, unless you've got some extremely thick case that won't allow them to work.  I'll throw the straight cables in my travel bag, and perhaps my car, where little annoyances like that won't matter so much for as relatively rarely as they're used.Otherwise, I love these:* Since you have tips which stay permanently in the USB (or i-device) socket, your phone's charging port never gets full of pocket lint and needs cleaning.* There's less chance of damage to your charging port, from exceeding the thousands of connect/disconnect cycles the port can handle, to pushing/pulling at an angle and damaging it.* The L-shaped cables swivel very easily, and disconnect if you pull on them, preventing damage to your device.* The magnetic cables connect very easily, you just get your device within an inch of the cable and it'll magnetically connect up, itself.  No fumbling around in the dark trying to plug in your charging cable.* No need to swap changing cables when you want to switch between charging older micro usb devices versus newer usb-c devices.  And it's so easy to connect/disconnect devices, lots of places I previously had two cables, I only need one.* The charging cables are thin, light and flexible, including the 10ft lengths.  Typically, longer USB cables get rather thick, heavy and inflexible, making them unpleasant to use.* However, I do HATE the blinding bright blue LED shining out the rear and sides, making it difficult to sleep in the same room as your phone is charging.  The LED shining out the front is fine, where you can see it when nothing is connected but gets blocked when a device is plugged-in. I needed to go around the rest of the plug with a few inches of black electrical tape to block the light.  Perhaps black paint would be a better fix.  There are some compatible magnetic cables with a special swivel head which do this right, but I hear they are fragile, which I can certainly believe by looking at the mechanism, so those are out of the question for me.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charge;Slow to charge
4.0 out of 5 stars;I love these things!;"I am a tech nerd and have lots of different devices.  I hate having different charging cables coming or charging adapters to accommodate different types of USB or Apple proprietary charging cables. With this set of cables and its generous amount of USB and lightning cable adapters I pretty much need just one cord to keep everything charged.  The cool thing is that I put the little metal thingee into the USB slot of the device and they can all share the same cable.  This is life-changing stuff if you have dozens of devices all thirsty for charging.The good:- Nice assortment of lengths- The cables seem pretty durable with a woven cable guard instead of the cheap plastic wrap on lesser cables.- Charging is not high speed, but it is certainly fast enough for every device, table, phone, earbud, etc. that I own.- There is a cool blue light at the end of the cable that helps you locate the ends, especially useful in dark places like beneath the car dash.The Bad:- The metal charging tips are slightly wider than my Pixel 6 phone, so the kinda stick out a bit, and take some getting used to.  I have had them on for a couple of months now and no longer notice them, but it bugged me for a those first few days- If you have a lot of devices, you will need more of the metal tips than are provided in this kit.  I need a lot more tips than cables (since the devices can share the cables).  But I don't see a way to buy just the tips.The ugly:- While I love the blue light glow, it is can be super bright in a very dark room.  When I turn my lights out in the bedroom, the blue glow seems a little too bright.  I wish there were at least one cable in the pack without the light.Overall Grade: Solid ""A"""
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good for people who drop their phone, not great for keeping a charge;So I tend to drop my phone a lot, especially when it's plugged in and the cord gets caught on something. I have broken about 6 different chargers now as a result of them landing wrong and bending. So the way this charger connects with a magnet makes it so that I can't break it. It works well for the purpose I got it.The light makes it easy to find in the dark which is also nice when you have a mass of tangled cables for 10 different devices next to your bed. The downside is if you're easily annoyed by lights when trying to sleep, like myself, you will have to either unplug it or try and hide it under something because you can't turn it off, which is annoying.I see some other people have an issue with the charge rate, but personally I don't mind. It is a little bit slower but not unreasonable if you charge your phone at appropriate times where you can leave it plugged in for a few hours.The thing I DO have an issue with, is that if you leave the little magnet in the port, your battery drains 2-3x more quickly. It's insane. Usually when I get back from my part time of 4 hours, I still have at least 80% of my battery on a 3 year old phone. If I leave this thing inside, I end up with 40% left, maybe even less if I've been using it a lot. This by itself wouldn't be the worst if it didn't mean that I'm going to be killing my battery life so quickly with the more frequent charging. The amount of dead lithium this thing would create is unacceptable and is a huge design flaw. If the plug was more easily removed, then I'd just do that when not charging it, but I had to use literal pliers to get this thing out. For this reason I can't recommend this product unless the positives outweigh the negatives for you.
3.0 out of 5 stars;It’s ok;I like the idea of magnetic power plugs so figured I’d give these a try. It comes with a decent amount of plugs and the cables are nice a pliable. The lengths are also nice and the right angle plug is useful for my phone. They charge my devices without issue. They cannot be used for data transfer.However, the reason for 3 stars? The light. The piercing bright blue light. I think having a light is a good thing to let you know it’s working, but it should ONLY be on the flat side that connects to the adapter. Instead, they chose to also add a large right at the base of the plug that is so bright it can double as a night light. There is no way to turn this off. If you don’t plan to use this to charge your devices (phone, watch, headphones) at night in your bedroom then this isn’t a big deal. But if you like a dark room, look elsewhere.Also, the magnet is pretty weak and doesn’t take much for the cable to come unplugged. Again, not a problem if you use it on stationary devices but trying to use your phone is challenging as any slight movement will dislodge it. On the plus side if you use it in a dark room and it falls to the floor, the bright beacon of blue light will make it easy to find.All in all, this is a good product if you don’t care about the light and plan to keep your devices stationary for charging. But for me, it’s a 3 star product.
4.0 out of 5 stars;durability, function but lacking charging speed;The unique design is great, and durability quality is also well made.  The negative is the charging speed as these charge much slower than a normal plug in charger.  These are still very great, especially if you have multiple types of charging devices.  Girlfriend has Iphone, I have android, so we can use the same cords by just leaving the magnet adaper in our phones.  Also good for all other charging devises and if friends come around, I always have a charging adapter.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Not the best magnet;I do like this charger for the most part. I just wish the magnet was stronger. It tends to fall off when I’m using my phone and not really moving it. Going to be looking for something stronge
4.0 out of 5 stars;Slow 🐌 fast charging cords;This is a useful concept that i like. Good quality cords well made. Charging is much slower then direct plug style.
3.0 out of 5 stars;USB for CHARGING ONLY.;I like the quality construction and the automatic magnetic attachments with led end lights. I'd not like that these are only charging cables and will not pass data. If you don't need standard USB functions...just charging...they are excellent.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Low output;The more I use these the more I realize how bad they are for high wattage devices.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Beware: bright, blue light!;Item does what it says it'll do, but 2 bright blue lights go on  whenever it's plugged in. I need my phone nearby while I sleep (for a sleep app and an alarm clock), Sadly I can't charge my phone while I sleep, anymore.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Simple to use.;Works great and saves ware on the plug.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works as advertised.;This is a neat concept that provides a couple of useful actions.  I primarily bought it for the plug that goes into a bike computer micro USB slot that does not have a cover.  I thought the included plug would help protect the slot from collecting dirt and debris, and it does. The package though offers the excellent option of having one cord that can be used to charge multiple electronic devices rather than having to have two or three cords because of the terminal connections (Micro USB, Lightning, and USB-C). It could/should have included a mini USB as well, but doesn't, however, I suspect those can be purchased if needed.  The round magnetic connectors are a bit larger than the plug end, so while they do help protect the slot, they can also be in the way on certain devices, such as an iPhone, where the connector is larger than the phones thickness.  This could be a problem on deeply recessed plug slots. Once in place, they are snug enough to remain in place, but still relatively easy to remove. However, they are small, so easy to misplace if removed and not placed back in the small plastic storage case that comes with the kit.  The charging cables seem to be well made and durable.  They have a blue LED that glows while plugged in to show you the cable is getting power.  The magnet is sufficiently strong to enable charging and not easily be knocked loose. I'm not sure these allow as much charge to flow as a standard cable however.  On my bike computer, when charging with a standard cable, I can push a button to check the current charge level.  That feature does not work when using this cable.  Instead, I have to turn the unit on to see the charge state. It obviously does charge the unit and seems to charge at a similar rate to the standard charger, but this issue could be potentially problematic. All things considered, I'd buy this again and do recommend it to others.
2.0 out of 5 stars;These are not fast charge cords;Using this chord with the fast charge block for Samsung it still said it needed hours to charge now mind you this is when it wasn't even in use it was just sitting there screen off maybe some background apps doing stuff but even then it shouldn't take 5 hours to charge a battery if this is a good cord they're very thin wired It's like a wire braid and I don't know to me they seem pretty flimsy considering other cords we purchased before and this is the set we finally got because the other set did not come. I thought I would make it easier for my daughter because of her vision so that it would keep the portion in her phone that would then magnetically attached to it to charge your phone instead of fighting to put it into the phone with limited vision If she's going to leave her phone sit for 6 hours without use It's great but I wouldn't suggest this unless you're going to literally turn off your phone and leave it alone for 6 hours
3.0 out of 5 stars;Does not transfer media;Great for charging if thats all you do. These do not allow media transfer to and from the device that it is connected to.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great charging cable option;I've seen a few magnetic cables on crowdsourcing sites and wanted to own some with low-cost entry. Mainly because all my cable tends to fray at the connector or even the connector comes apart due to frequent use/abuse (i.e. pulling out, putting in, etc...). The great thing about these is that you get multiple USB type caps to put into your device and leave them there. The cable package comes in varying lengths and types so you can have one in the office, in your car, or anywhere else you would need to charge your device.I was a bit worried that my QC2.0 devices will not get a quick charge but it is pretty close. I say this because if I use a standard braided non-magnetic cord on my device I may have 60 mins of fast charging but if I switch to the magnetic cord it will be 65-70 mins. The alternative would be to use a non-QC charger which will put you at up to 2hrs. For now, this is just what I need so that I can easily disconnect my device, switch which devices need charging or prevent nasty falls like if my pet happens to pull on the card just hard enough, it would generally cause my phone to fall but now the cable will just come off.This review is using these cables for about two weeks. Assuming they last for a month or longer is yet to be seen but I would expect them to be good for a long time.Update 6/26/2020: Dropped by one star because as of 7 weeks of ownership, the cords are still in great condition but at least two of my magnetic connectors have failed, not charging device. The order does come with multiples across the different types but wanted to warn others that this may happen. Not planning on ordering replacement connectors yet as I have two full sets and several dupes to replace for now.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good price, variety and convenience, but slow charging is this products downfall.;PROS:The price on this was good for what you get. I paid just under $20 and got 4 variously sized and shaped cables.The tip of the cables glow blue when powered, which makes it easy to tell if it's plugged in and it looks nice!Seems durable enough but time will tell. I'll update this if any issues pop up.I like that it comes with multiple pieces of each magnetic adapter.I have use for all 3 magnetic adapters that it comes with.(Micro USB for my Smartwatch and gaming controllers, USB C for my Samsung Note 8 and Nintendo Switch controller, and Lightning cable for my BeatsX).I also like the variety of cable sizes:The Right Angle 6ft cable is great for my Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and PS4 Gaming controllers, and for my Smartphone.The 3ft cable will be great for my car but I hope it runs Android Auto (I doubt it, see CONS for explanation).The shortest cable is great for my Smartwatch and BeatsX.I still had enough Magnetic adapters and a cable left to give one to my mother for her Micro USB cable using phone and Lightning Cable using iPad.CONS:As I feared, you DO get what you pay for.No fast/quick charge capability!Seriously?Damn near every device nowadays has fast/quick charge capabilities. (Even wireless fast/quick charge!).This makes me concerned that I also wont be able to transfer data via the cables and tips either, and that eliminates my ability to use Android Auto (I am not optimistic but will update when I've tested).*Here's the main issue:If I can't use Android Auto, I'll need to remove the Magnetic USB C tip every time I drive, which will eventually lead to the Magnetic tips getting lost.*NOTE: The seller never advertised fast/quick charge capability or data transfer capabilities (to my knowledge) but given the state of technology right now I'd assumed that this feature would be standard.Overall I give it 3/5 stars for the Price, Versatility, Variety and quantity of cable sizes and Magnetic tips.I would have given 5/5 stars if it allowed Fast Charge, but it's a decent product for the price.
3.0 out of 5 stars;slow charging;like the connection and chord length .. but not a fan of having it lit up at night, much less all the time.  Very slow at charging as well.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Metal flakes off;The metal will keep flaking off the magnetic plugin to the point it will not change anymore.
3.0 out of 5 stars;its ok;the wire didn't last long. it tore from the end. And sometimes it has fast charging and sometimes it doesn't.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Bought to prevent breakage;I purchased these after having purchased many standard charging cables. My preteen son would get a cable use it for a while between his controllers, tablets and phone (USB charging) and wind up breaking the adapter or the charge port of the device itself. It had to do with him removing and reinserting the cables. With these he has not broken one cable. I will be purchasing more as my cats ate through one of the cables right after we bought it (hence 4/5 for durability). They have left the other cables alone. We are now running into the problem of having run out of USB adapters so I will be getting new ones of those as well. This will give me the ability to use it in my car also without having to remove the adapter. The 1-foot cord is not really useful for us and we don't have need for fast charging. It will charge my phone even while I'm using it, just slower than when I'm not.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good but magnet not very strong;Like the product but the magnet is not very strong
3.0 out of 5 stars;Lightning doesn't work;Have had this style forever, and got a company iPhone.  Couldn't find the lightning adapters so figured I'd buy some more cables.  Well, the adapters do not work with an iPhone 1.  Had to buy a normal cable.  No great hardship, I can't have enough of these mag cables for everything else.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not quite as advertised;I’m liking the various cord lengths, but the magnets are not very strong so you have to be careful where you set them to charge.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Strong magnets;Magnet is strong enough to stay connected and won't easily fall off. Cable has nice braided feel. Handy that ends are illuminated making finding it easily in the dark.Adapter tip will eventually break or fall apart if you put on a mobile phone subjected to a lot of daily movement. Mine lasted about 4-5 months. Glue holding it together isn't that strong. Be sure to buy extra tips.
3.0 out of 5 stars;No worse than standard cables.;The various lengths are useful but charging power and speed seem to vary but not by length just randomly. They seem to be fairly free of kinks and shorts. I like them for the reduced wear and tear on my charging port and the ease of the magnetic connection.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Does not do data transfer (won't transmit controller input);Good cable. Sheathing is flexible and sturdy. Sheathing doesn't bind and tangle. Does not transmit data but that's mostly my fault for not doing a little more research. Does not support fast charging with my current bricks.
4.0 out of 5 stars;only for charging;these only work for charging, so they need to be removed for data. Having said that, they work GREAT for charging. We ordered a second set. We are in a marine environment and it's great having the end of the unit mounted in the phone base to help it keep the salt environment out. Not sure about durability, but we will certainly find out
3.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charging.  Easy to use. Connection hold is mediocre.;The cord lengths are great. The variety of connectors is terrific.  Charging is slow.  The magnetic connection is mediocre.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Made my life so much easeir;The thing that made me start looking at these was that I had to dig lint out of my charging port a few times to maintain  a quickish charge time. This has proven A) to make charging way easier at night as I can see the cord head and it auto connects to the phone and B) my phone charges at a stable rate and I don't have to clean out the port every few weeks to keep it running. The magnet is there but its not the strongest, if you bump it too hard it disconnects and if you pull the cord head off wrong there will be sparks/ an electric arc that resets your phone. So I have gotten cautious about where I place my phone for the night and make sure to pull the cord off the directed way. I still charge and use my phone and experience only minimal issues when the cord disconnects cause I moved. Over all I still use this and just have grown use to the down sides because this system has way more ups and convenience than issues.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Easy to damage cables;I've enjoyed the easy charging connection for some time but there are some issues with the cable durability.Twice now I've managed to damage a cable in a way that shorts out the USB power supply. They were on different chargers, and both chargers had current limiters so they didn't get damaged. But all the other devices on the charger were then not charging.First incident was closing the lid on the cabinet where the charger is hidden and the cable was pushed to 90 degrees a bit. Second incident was the cable was on the floor and got tangled in my shoe and snapped taught. Both caused the cable to short out internally.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Versatile charger family pack;I haven't spent a great deal of time with this product, but it is very versatile and easy to use. The cables are sleeved with a thin, paracord type of cover. So it is more cloth feeling than plastic, which means they are very flexible. The magnets are plenty strong, I had to separate them over an inch before they would stop repelling each other.There are 3 types of connectors, with 4 sets of each for a total of 12 magnetic port connectors. So you have multiple ways of charging all the household devices, from a tablet to an iPhone, or Android device.Also, no more fumbling around in the dark, trying 10 different ways to get the charger in. Once in, the port connector is quite snug and requires fingernails to pull out.Now the cons. First off, this WILL NOT be useful for data transfer, it only passes a USB 5V charge. Secondly, the USB A end of the cable fits extremely snug in USB ports-almost dangerously so. One may be inclined to just leave it plugged in on that side. The main problem being you will still need another cable for data transfer, which I did with the photos posted here. Who needs more cables?Despite that, I love em and can highly recommend these quality chargers to remove unnecessary frustration from your life.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Amazing technology and great for saving your device connections.;I go through a lot of cables with many different devices and various causes (kids, pets, drops) that can lead to costly repairs on my plugged-in devices. Magnetic charging is the best way I've found to go, wireless chargers on certain QI enabled devices and they never seem to work perfect (phone case blocks charging, charges inconsistent, the device gets moved just out of the sweet spot). I really like these cables and they appear to be high quality and easily snap in place.That said there are some drawbacks. The first set I bought had 90-degree angle connections with an end that sticks out slightly, this is said to enable you to swivel the device. I find these angles to be pointless as the straight connections can turn just as easily. I also had an RMA on one of the 90-degree cables as it melted using a fast charger in my car, luckily I removed it immediately and used a straight end cable with no issues. The other issue seems to be a conductance problem with the magnets on the end. They do not charge as fast as a normal cable (around 60% for my phone). I may try electroplating the end in gold to see if it solves this, they should come with gold contacts by default, just my opinion seeing as they do cost more than standard cables and most high quality cables are like this.
5.0 out of 5 stars;THE solution to broken charging ports;Honestly amazing!!! THE solution for kids breaking the charging ports !!! Plenty of different lengths and adaptor pieces, cannot recommended these enough !
3.0 out of 5 stars;Un cable malo;3 de los 4 cables funcionan bien, pero uno de ellos no funciona, prende el led pero no da carga
3.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't stay in, otherwise okay;The magnet is so strong it is difficult to disconnect without taking the whole thing out, making the entire magnetic part useless (at least for USB-C)Also, one of the six foot cords is really bad and instead of two hour charging time like my previous one and the rest of them bundles, it becomes 19 hours charging time
3.0 out of 5 stars;Difficult to use with phone cover;These looked like a good idea but there's a problem if you have a cover on your phone.  My plastic phone cover fits tightly on the phone with cut outs for the charging port and other parts of the phone.  The opening for the charging port isn't large enough for the magnetic adapter to fit fully into the port so it pulls out easily.  If you're determined to make these work, you could try making the opening larger but I wasn't that determined so will return them.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Androids charge slow. IPhone seems fine.;So I love the magnetic design. Can take like 3 to 4 hours to charge my Galaxy S10e. IDK why people aren't talking too much about that, I guess most people have iPhone which a lot of models just use 1A charging from the factory. The 6ft cable takes FOREVER to charge. I wish the LED was red. At night, these cables are actually unhealthy to have in your bedroom because of how much bright, blue light they produce. Red would be awesome. If the LEDs went off when disconnected that would be cool. Maybe Red=disconnected, blue = charging, green = charged but that's hard and I wouldn't want to design that.PROS:simpledurableversatileCONS:wish magnet was a lot stronger (comes out if charging while lying down for ex)light should be RED (hurts eyes, can't sleep with them in room lol)androids charge very slow with 6ft cable. 3 ft seems fineDo I recommend? Hmmmm if there is an alternative with no light and that claims to charge properly with android, get that! if you're an iphone user and you don't charge your phone in your bedroom, sure get it!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Great for a short time.;It quit charging my device, saying that it was not supported by my device, so I had to go back to my other charging system.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Blue light will keep you and/or your spouse from sleeping;You intend to use at least one of these cables to charge your phone while you're sleeping, right? And that means setting it up in your bedroom. Well, problem is, there's an incredibly strong blue light on each cable, *inside* the connector surface. If you live alone, that's fine. connect the charger before you go to sleep and it covers (most of) the light.If you share your bedroom with another person, however, and they go to bed before you do, the light will keep them awake. (It keeps my wife awake, anyway.) And this isn't like other devices where you can just cover the light with electrical tape. the light is (partially) *inside* the charging surface. Using tape will render the cable useless.Works fine otherwise. Consider these cables as long as you're the only person who sleeps in your bedroom.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Do not use with 5W and iPads;The problem with these that aren’t stated is they lose charging power through the connection.We realized using a 5W apple genuine charging brick and apple genuine cable charges my sons iPad, albeit slowly but enough to keep it from discharging.If I plug these cables into the same charger and same iPad it won’t charge it. We tested with more 5W USB sources like laptops, desktop computers, other chargers.We concluded NO 5W chargers will charge a larger device like an iPad. So my cars USB ports, most spare chargers we have are useless with this cable since you need 10/15/18 watt USB chargers to overcome the loss in the cable connection.They brag about 2.4A charging but I’ll bet my next paycheck if I put a multimeter on the end that not a single charger will push 2.4A through these.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Highly recommend;So far I love these. The hardest part for me was inserting the small metal ends into the devices. Arthritic fingers so took a couple tries but once their in WOW how nice. The blue light is clearly visible just grab the light and touch to the metal part on your device it basically hooks itself ! I can use it in the dimmest of lights at night. The extra ends will be wonderful when the families come to visit. They all seem to forget chargers and some have different ends than I use.Best part is the side hookup cable I use as my phone charges from the bottom and the cables were constantly bent and broken or became too loose to stay plugged in if you moved your hand at all.I can plug it in and run the cable off to the side or if using my stand just swivel it to the front and it fits in the center great. If I happen to move to far the magnet simply disconnects instead of pulling and damaging the plug in part if my phone.  I would recommend these for sure.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Falls short;These cords don't charge anything like regular cords.  Seems lie more if a novelty item.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Great product for a while then scary. Please please read;"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Update four months later:So this morning I woke up to my phone being completely dead and iPad not being fully charged. The cables were connected properly as always but this time I noticed the white plastic around the blue led was melted on the iPhone cord and the same with the iPad cord but the adapter inside the iPad was melted inside the iPad as well. I could smell melted plastic when I woke up. On one of the cords the plastic had actually melted its way back into the the metal end and then back out the end that connects to the device. Now let me also say that these two cords were connected to a plug in adapter that takes two usb cords and two regular plug ins. One of the regular plug ins had my Apple Watch cord connected. That cord was fine but I did notice the watch didn’t get a full charge as well. So basically what I’m saying is that I think the plug adapter (not related to these charging cords) was the initial problem but how these cords reacted is what’s very scary and dangerous. My Apple Watch charger (Apple brand) didn’t melt and still works. The led on the cords work as well but do not charge.  Please be careful and cautious with off market brands. We had to pull adapter from iPad with a wrench because it was stuck.This was my first review:These chargers are great. I have purchased four sets at this point because They are so great. I keep the adapter in my phone and iPad at all times and have a cable set up at my bed, in my car and in my kitchen. You don’t even have to mess with putting it in. The magnetic adapter finds it way when it’s close enough. So nice to just pull the phone away when I need to step away from the area.  The magnetic hold is pretty strong but there will be instances when you have to move or something and it detaches. Not a big deal once you learn your boundaries. That’s why I purchased the multiple sizes. Long one is at my bedside so that I have enough room to adjust if I need to change my position. The other awesome part is if you have any metal on your bedside lamp. When I get up in the morning I detach my phone and iPad from their chargers and then just connect them to my metal lamp. It’s nice that they don’t have to fall to the floor or I don’t have to buy the cable holders. The chargers have a blue led light that shows you they are charging. Sometimes since I sleep facing that side I have to move them or corner them slightly with a book because they can be bright if you are sensitive to light in the dark like I am. All in all, these chargers are the very best."
5.0 out of 5 stars;Best charging cable ever;Love that it gives you different cord lengths and various charger heads
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great customer service!;Update: Contacted support regarding broken Cables and they sent me replacements and received it the next day! Thank you!!!Original Review: After about a couple of months of use, the wires inside the cables broke or got disconnected. The blue LED light that would normally be on when connected to a power source was off. I also noticed that the magnetic end of the cable where the blue light is, got very hot. This I suspect it may had caused the breakage inside the cable. I think 2 of the cables are still working, kind of. Im not sure. I stopped using them.The magnetic feature makes it easier to charge devices, I just wish the cables could last longer than traditional cables and that it didn’t pose a safety hazzard.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Still on the fence;Sometimes I have to find the right angle so it doesn't break connection. Also doesn't seem to get me a fast charge.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Cool concept with the magnetism and multiple connectors;The cords came with multiple connects which include the iphone connect, the usbc, and the android connector. There is a light at the end of the cord that plugs into the wall that does not turn off. The charging speed is slow compared with other charges. The magnetic cord frequently disconnects from the tip that is in the device as it does not have a very strong hold. The length of the cords are sufficient for multiple purposes.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Slooooooow charging.  NOT FOR GIG WORKERS!!;I bought these because I am a gig worker.  I'm constantly in and out of my car, keeping my phone on me because I don't want to miss that order that I may get while I'm inside a business or at a customer's address.  I have several apps running on a regular basis.  Mapping apps, mileage trackers, and the gig apps themselves.  My battery on my work phone dies quick if I don't keep it plugged in while I'm driving around.  But its a hassle having to search for the plug to make sure I have the cord turned the right way then manuevering it into the charger hole.  These issues are the very reason I bought this item.As it turns out, this isn't even 2.0mA charger cord.  I assumed, perhaps foolishly, that 2.0mA was the standard that a new item would be.  When I go to the dollar store and buy a charger, I expect it'll be garbage 1.4mA or whatever it is.  I assumed this would charge my phone at least as fast as my default 2.0mA cord.  Turns out, it JUST keeps my battery from going any lower when its plugged in.  So over the course of a day my charge depletes consistently as I remove my phone from my car.  The convenience of the magnet is great - but I can't afford to let my battery dip as low as it gets using this charger.  Part of the description says supports QC 2.0 fast charging.  I assumed that meant 2.0mA.  I guess its a specialized thing, though.  I threw the box in the garbage the second I opened it and saw that it was indeed charging my phones so I can't return it.  I'm not happy about that, though.  I suppose if I had a phone I only needed to charge once a day, like overnight or something, I might have a use for it.It's pretty much just going to sit around collecting $22.00 worth of dust though.  Very disappointed, thought this was going to make my job easier.  The description should mention that it is a slow charger for most applications.
5.0 out of 5 stars;They work as promised;I bought these for my 6 year old to use on his amazon tablet. He's been through 2 or 3 tablets now because he's rough on the charging ports and they eventually just stop taking a charge. I figured if I used this, he wouldn't have to mess with the ports and it would be real easy for him. It was a great investment. Only struggle was getting him to keep track of the cords. This product comes with multiple different charging adapters so you can use it on about anything. I use it on a handheld gaming console so I don't wear out the charging port. These work good and hold up good, I'd recommend them.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Displeased With Charging;The magnetic tip comes unplugged constantly if you move at all while charging. Also took 12 hours to charge completely. Would not purchase again.
3.0 out of 5 stars;two flaws;so its nice that it charges magnetically however i noticed my s10+ considers its charge to be slow, it wasn't super slow however so i figured its not so bad. THEN i tried data transfer and that didn't work at all computer didn't even recognize it. so i tried my a different magnetic charge cable with different plug n such. worked smoothly and did not claim slow charge. the cable that works isn't commonly found on amazon. im still searching. i wont be returning this cable since i gave them to family as a gift to charge phones and devices but i was curious to test it out so i kept one and discovered those flaws. if fast chargings a deal breaker for you, don't buy this set of cables.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works as advertised;So easy to switch cables to whatever needs charging. I would like to see them in different colours so that they are easier to see. Maybe in red.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Works, but not great;"I bought this at the suggestion of a friend who loves his.  At first it seemed all was well, but then I started to notice that charging was taking considerably longer.  Usually this could be fixed with a quick disconnect/reconnect but in a few minutes it would slow down again. It usually gave me then ""Connect the charger tha came with the phone for faster charging"" message when this happened.  I tried cleaning the connection and insert, swapping to one of the others it came with, but after a week it didn't seem to matter anymore.  I would set up my phone's GPS while driving and plug it in, but it would charge slower than my phone was using power.  At work I often don't have much time to charge so a slower charge just wasn't good enough for me.  The lengths provided were mostly good, but I didnt have much use for the 1 foot cord."
3.0 out of 5 stars;Year of use. Headaches galore.;For a while the cables worked quite well. Things snapped into place, I could find them in the dark, etc. However, there have been 3 problems that I have noticed.1) iphones are apparently especially prone to this one. basically the connection would get a bit loose. it was difficult to tell if it was because of the case, or because of the actual magnetic bit was damaged, but it happened multiple times and i quickly ate through the connections (they became duds).2) the connections can create divits in the bottom of your phone if it is not hard enough. I have a bit of plastic on the bottom of my phone and now i have an indent where there was not one before.3) the connective bits that live in your phone are very fragile. i have had them break in every which way. the metal ring has broken off, or chipped, the metal inner button goes missing, the whole t shape breaks. it has been quite the headache. needs some serious quality control.I would recommend just getting a multi usb port that you can plug into a wall unless you need this item for a specific reason
3.0 out of 5 stars;Broke fast;Sadly these all broke within a month of us having them. The cord itself not the part that goes into the phone thankfully. It just stopped keeping connected and charging.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Ipad charging no-go;Doesn't charge Ipad - bought this so I could use it to charge all my portable devices, can't charge my iPads though
2.0 out of 5 stars;Worked okay for a while;When I first bought these, it was mainly for my younger son's tablet.  He likes to play it while it is charging, and you can imagine what they eventually does to the charging port.  They worked well, and even had fast charging.  Fast forward to now:  I have 1 cable left, and have had to buy a pack of magnetic charge port adapters again.The magnets on the part that goes into your phone will eventually fall off.  Every single one of mine did.  The cables will eventually stop holding on well, and then stop charging.  The last cable I have left will literally cut out (LED cuts off and everything) intermittently, which has made charging devices pretty much impossible.You live and you learn I guess.  I will be replacing mine with a different brand, rather than spending more money on something I know is going to fail.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Charges slow;This charger is quite slow. Also the magnet is not really strong so it keeps getting separated from the phone. I don't like this model of charger. I will have to try another model because I find myself with low charge when I have to leave the house
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great, and solved problems I didn't know I had.;These are great. The minor stress of Micro USB and C fittings is gone. Trying to attach USB charging cable while driving at night is now simple. The magnetic end you need is glowing blue. Then you just need to put it close to the charging port on your phone, and the magnets do the rest.  Added advantage, the tip of the charging cable is illuminated  solid blue, if your charger looses power (if your charger becomes unplugged, or switched off) the tip of the cable flashes. Now I can share 1 cable between 3 devices with different charging ports. Now I have 1 cable in the kitchen, 1 in the car, and 1 cable in the bedroom. Since the little magnetic adapter stays in your phone I am hoping that the phones will last longer. My USB  will also probably not get plugged with lint, dust, and possibly metal shavings.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Seems to do the job;Definitely easier to use than a standard plug-in, and the little light does make it pretty clear when it is charging, and that is very helpful, especially in a car. The magnetic tips don't hold nearly as strongly as the promotion suggests, but it does well enough, and I find it much easier to use. I suspect it will mean a lot less wear and tear on the USB port and my phone itself. Used at home and in car for over a month so far and very pleased.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Fantastic solution for simplifying and protecting your wireless devices;I absolutely love these cables. I bought them to clean up my desk. I got enough tips to cover all my wireless peripherals and have one charging cord. The magnetic tip had an added bonus for desk use as it just sticks to any metal part of my desk. They charge slightly slower but I like them so much overall that I switched all my devices. The tips actually saved my wife's phone once already. She had a bottle of lotion break in her bag and have the mag safe tip in there kept the USB pins completely clean and unharmed. Highly recommend for anyone looking to simply charging solutions and/or looking for an extra bit of safety for there devices.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good Product;it's a really helpful charger charges phone pretty fast the only thing that sucks is that it doesn't work for car play
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good for non apple products, mediocre otherwise.;I've been using these for a while now.  If you have a device with usb micro or usb c, these are golden.  They work great.  My only complaints are I wish the cord sizes were all long, and most important, the iPhone connectors stink.  My wife went through 3 of them in less than a year and I went through 1.  Compared to the other connectors (which still work fine), they aren't durable at all.  I highly recommend this product if you don't have an iPhone.  If you do have a iPhone, get more lightning connectors because you're going to go through them.  It still might be worth purchasing though as it saves on wear and tear on the port.  Note the cord durability is great.  Still holding up after months of use.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Connection is erratic;Connection is erratic especially on the 90* joints.  The charge flashes on and off when you move.  Don't move, you say.  Well If you are going to charge while sitting stationary on a table the convenience of having a swiveling 90* quick connection is unnecessary.The straight connector hooks up and charges well except if you move about, (as when reading a Kindle book while charging) then it will disconnect and fall off.I think this concept is great.  Perhaps another brand would work better.
3.0 out of 5 stars;decent charging cable;decent product
4.0 out of 5 stars;very useful, so far;"I've been using the 360 charging cable for about a week.... so far so  good.  I have a disability that limits my hand/finger dexterity, so traditional usb micro/type c/ iproduct  connectors are impossible for me to manipulate (i depend on others to connect them for me).  This product gives me greater independence . after others  do the initial ""insert""< I just leave the connector in and I can charge my device(s) without help  :)WARNING: The right angle connectors  will not work with all covers/shells... I tried with otterbox and another cover neither worked (the 90 degree connection magnet is too short... however, the ""straight in"" magnetic connectors worked for both  covers/shells.Also, the iproduct inserts have an absolute top/bottom.... the top is marked with an arrow and the display is considered the top of the iproduct.  after i flipped and reinserted . it worked as described... this was not a problem where the 360 connect ""joined the magnetic insert ...Customer service was quite helpful"
3.0 out of 5 stars;Novel but disappointing;I got these charging cords as a supplement to my doordashing. I am constantly taking my phone off/on my car charger.  When I first received the chargers, I was impressed by how useful they actually turned out to be.  They allowed me to be in/out very quickly, and the idea of being able to use the same cord with multiple devices with different charging ports was a plus.However, the product faces a fatal flaw, and that is durability.  After only a couple of months, the charging cords are already losing their magnetism, and several of the inserts for my chargeable items have broken.  The discs which the magnets snap onto are prone to breaking, and they also pick up a ton of dirt and other debris that prevent good contact between cord and port.Overall pretty disappointing.  They were convenient for a while, but aside from dishing out the money to order new ones every couple of months, the convenience they create is definitely not worth the frustrations they cause.TL.DR worked fine at first, then everything started deteriorating.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Don’t allow to touch metal;These are great as long as the magnetic tip stay free from touching any other metal surfaces whil connected. It will blow a fuse or melt away, hazardous smoke or fire starter.
3.0 out of 5 stars;The cables work fine but I already have one that doesn't work;Cables are a dream to use but my 3 ft cable failed on me already hence the 3 star rating I am not sure if I want to go through the hassle of returning them all to get it fixed but yeah just a heads up you might get a lemon.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Disappointed;Poor quality. Little connetion you plug into your phone brake easy. Poor charging power. I bought previously from different company and was so happy, unfortunately no longer available so I bought this. Not the same!!!! Money wasted
4.0 out of 5 stars;Light;Honestly, it's a great charger that I have the small part plugged in all the time. It's nice to just be able to have it be magnetic and not have to manually plug it in. It's charging speed is actually just as good if not better than my previous charger. The only problem I have even if it's small is just the blue light that is constantly on while plugged it. It may help in the dark when I may be looking for it but when I'm in bed just scrolling through on my phone the light can be a little annoying.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great way to consolidate chargers;These work great. Originally I was just gonna use it for my wireless headphones to make plugging them in easier. After getting the first set though, I ended up using them on everything! Being able to take a bunch of different devices and have them all use the same charging tip is really nice.My only gripes are the charging speed is a little slow (which I expected) and the blue light in the tip is bright. Like, obnoxiously bright. I had to tape over the one on my night stand.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Nope;Don't waste your money
4.0 out of 5 stars;so, so bright. Maybe too bright. Definitely too bright.;Trust me, I feel terrible for the click-baitness. I'm at 8 months since I started using these and they are still going strong. I've experienced only one issue with charging on my ipad, where it seemed to drain completely and would not recharge without plugging it into a traditional charger. That resolved it.My biggest issue is how insanely bright the charge light is. If you intend to use these in the bedroom, expect to be throwing clothing over it. No hyperbole, it is intense enough to read by. All the devices I use it with have on screen charge notifications, rendering this feature even more of an issue. I would very supportive of a version of these with no charge light.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great Product but Don’t Leave Cords in Car;Good product, compatible with the iPhone se 2020. I bought this solely for the 90 degree cord so the extra cords and tips are a plus. The magnet isn’t strong but that’s also a reason as to why I bought it. I have a child that likes to run around the house and often forgets to look where they’re going when caught up in horseplay so when they pass by, the cord disconnects without ripping my product from my hands or pulling anything to the ground.NOTE: Do NOT leave these cords in the car on a 73 degree (Fahrenheit). The plastic in the charging tip melted, covering the piece that does the charging. I’ll have to remelt or cut the plastic to get the charging piece exposed or throw it away.
1.0 out of 5 stars;It Burns While It Charges;"Like everyone, I purchased a pack to make charging easier. What's more convenient than not having to plug/unplug your cables.The magnets are strong. Despite the fact that it sticks straight out of the device, bumping the cord doesn't knock it out. I can pick up an 8"" tablet by the cable. No complaints there.The single pole does not allow data to pass through. I've tried with several android devices. None of them were recognized by my computer. That's fine, as I purchased them for charging.Speaking of charging, I would NOT use these. My tablets and smart phones that require a 2A charger head up. I tried charging my Note 8, Note 9, and a Galaxy Tab with these cables. Universally, they all stated they were in slow charging mode. No matter what I did, they would still claim slow charging.What concerns me most is that the devices all would heat up over time. I've never had this happen with other chargers. Not even magnetic chargers. The device would be hot to the touch. I'd have to disconnect and wait for them to cool down before using.I also tried charging my PS4 controllers and gaming headset using these cables. These devices took much longer to charge. While I could normally charge while playing, the PS4 controller needed to be plugged in  for 3-4 hours (using these cables) before I could play. Normal charging was only about an hour for 1-2 bars using standard cables. As for my gaming headset, I leave it on the charger until I'm ready. After a day on these cables, it still gave a low battery notice when I put them on.I would NOT recommend these cables. I've used several magnetic cables, and these do not measure up."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great for my non-apple products;My wife has an IPhone X and my kids have an older IPad and an IPad pro, none of which worked with the magnetic chargers.  The portable chargers, the baby monitor, and my Pixel 3 all worked though.  It's not the huge win I was hoping for, but it's created a several more places for me to charge my phone which has been very nice.  If you have a specific device you're concerned about, I'd check the product details.  The question and answer section seems like several people guessing based on a similar product.The magnets hold well and I haven't had any issues so far of actually getting the device to charge.  I already purchased two more cables so I can replace the last few cables I have,
3.0 out of 5 stars;Durable, convenient, charging cables;"I like the provided ""tips"", the different cable lengths, and the product feel. These seem like they'll last a long time.I'm not /thrilled/ with the lighted tips. These are handy at home, and occasionally in the car, though they stay lit whenever the USB end is powered, and are distracting especially when driving at night. I'll probably tape or paint over the LED tip for the one I use in the car.For some reason, I thought that some ""answered questions"" claimed one can do data transfer with these cables, and that's NOT true -- the end that has the magnetic tip has only two electrical potentials, and one of those is ground. So there's no possibility of using these for data transfer (otherwise, I'd give them 5 stars for all aspects). The description itself says ""REMINDER : Due to the 360-degree Design it CAN'T apply to transfer data the cable just support charging the device. Support QC 2.0 Fast charging,Output 5V/2.4A (max). "" Either that wasn't there before, or I was silly and missed it. [By ""360-degree Design"" they mean that the magnetic bits can be rotated about the cord axis by any angle---this is true. Of course, that means there can be only a radial symmetry, which supports only two voltages]"
2.0 out of 5 stars;NOT WHAT I THOUGHT AT ALLL!!;The magnetic IS NOT STRONG!!!!!! like pictures advertised. U can swing them like shown in the pic. It takes a proximately 8 ants or by blowing on the magnetic port to simply fall out. And what’s up w the bbright asss blue light, LIGHTING up my entire village
3.0 out of 5 stars;DOES NOT TRASFER DATA!;If you JUST want this for charging (which is what I mostly use it for) then you'll probably be happy with these.  The magnetic attraction is much stronger than the previous version I had of these.  I've had these for 3-4 months and just recently had to switch out the piece in my phone as it wasn't working any longer (they provided multiples).  BUT.... I also transfer the photos from my phone to my hard drive via cable and I don't want to have to take out the magnet and switch to another cable.  I feel this is prematurely wearing out the magnet.  I would not purchase these again for this reason.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good charger;It is a good charging cord. Holding together well.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great Product and Deal;I really like not having to plug and unplug the lightning cable all the time. If I could make one change, it would be to disable the light coming out of the cable end as it’s so bright I could use it as a flashlight. The subtle light around the collar is nice though.Charging works well. The magnet is strong, but barely strong enough to keep the phone connected when hanging from the cable, not recommended for obvious reasons. The cable is braided, so seems pretty strong and you could pull on the cable to drag your phone within arms reach. But I wouldn’t recommend that either. The benefit of the magnet is making the connection between the cable end and the charging port on the phone. Just get them close and the cable jumps the final inch or so...very handy.Getting 4 different cables in the box is great since once you have the adapter in the port on the phone you won’t want to pull it out at different locations you charge your phone.So far I’m very happy with my purchase...
3.0 out of 5 stars;It didn’t occur to me that this can’t be used as a data cable;It didn’t occur to me that this can’t be used as a data cable. Makes sense, in retrospect, just putting that out there in case others don’t think of it. As a charging cable for phones/kindles/etc, they seem to work fine. They just don’t really fill my needs, as a charging-only cable.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Attractive to see, but doesn't charge most of the time.;Attractive LED light to see, but doesn't charge most of the time. Disappointed the magnet keeps pulling the small attachment. Therefore, what's the use of having a magnetic charger. Silly product just fancy looks.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Convienen.;Make it easier to charge while using. Takes a good bit linger to charge with 6 ft. cords. Did not receive the one foot cord. If you want what you’re paying for by from another seller.
4.0 out of 5 stars;So far, the cords are doing what I expected them to do!;The charging power is a little lower than my previous one..take about an hour to fully charge with a 2.4 square. The cord is very flexible. Not sure what this means for durability but it is encased with durable braided/woven fabric. The cords light up when plugged in, but not very useful In Terms of seeing the connector in dark light, but with a magnetic connector do you really need to see it? All the cord connectors are straight except for one six foot, it’s made at a right angle. It’s light is the brightest.I’m enjoying the cords at this time. Ive has them for a few days. If there are any updates later down the road I’ll post updates.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Only 1 cable can pivot.;I didn't make note of the picture in the ad that shows only one of the cables can pivot.  Also, when you remove the cable, the inserted magnet comes out with it.  Annoying.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Most of them are good;Got the pack where they come 4 cables and 4 of the connectors for each type.The shortest one I use with a power bank, have the longest - one on the living room and one on my bedroom.The one foot cable I use in my car - this is the one that I feel doesn't charge - I take long drives due to work and keep my phone plugged and still, not one doesnt charge - the phone continues to discharge.The other ones, including the 90 degree angle can charge my phone, iPad, wireless headphones and the controller of my PS4 - no problem with any of those and the magnet holds well.
5.0 out of 5 stars;If you've never used magnetic cables - This is for you.;Firstly, these are charging cables, they do not support data. Should be clear on the listing, but, just to be sure.I was a cable purist. I'm the guy that has a rat's nest on top of his case charging everything I own. Plugging in, unplugging every time I want to check messages or move around. Never thought anything about it.I bought some of these on impulse, and, man. What a life changer. Pick up the phone, cable automatically decouples. Set it down and just flick the port back on, no muss, no fuss. I am especially in love with the 1ft cables. If you leave your devices in one spot all the time to charge, it's typically all you need.After these, I immediately went out and ordered some 1ft mag data cables for my phone and tablet. So good.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Gets the job done;Had for a few weeks, so far it's easy to use, feels like it's solidly built. The light on the charging cable is bright, but when hooked to the phone it's not too bad. Only issue is charging speed. Occasionally it will quick charge, sometimes it will not. Have not been able to figure out what is causing this as it has been an issue on multiple cables and chargers.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Really cool, but get extra heads....;My family loves these. We are no longer worried about needing to have so many different types of chargers. Switching the cord from device to device is very convenient. My only issue is that the magnet on 2 of the connectors broke on two separate devices in the same day. Other than that this is amazing.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not for fast charging;"I'm not sure how different types of cables work, but my Moto G phone says, ""slow charging"" with these cables and ""Turbo charging"" with my other cable. I had to superglue the cover on the USB end of the 6"" cable to keep it on."
3.0 out of 5 stars;Fragile - Dongle Delaminates;The dongle breaks easily. This is the 2nd broken dongle. Of course after return window.I'm an early adopter for this tech. I've purchased several different magnetic charger brands. This is the first time the dongle has delaminated.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Hopefully no more sloppy loose charging connectors...;"I got tired of the wife and kids wearing out the charging ports on their devices. I had to replace the TINY connector port on my son's tablet TWICE from it getting so sloppy that it became very difficult to get a good connection for charging. Likewise the port on the wife's smart phone. Hopefully these magnetic connectors will cure THAT problem. They DO charge slower that the direct connectors, but we all just plug everything in overnight, so that isn't any issue. GET EXTRA adaptor ""buttons"" because they can get pulled out and dropped and disappear. All our stuff uses the USB ""micro""(?) connector, the one that only goes in one way. You only get one for each cord, but 2 of the apple style and 2 of the unidirectional new micro USB, which we don't have any use for (yet?).The cables just plug into any regular USB I style charging ports on whatever chargers you may already have. They seem to be pretty well made, but then hopefully nobody will use them for holding any weight!"
1.0 out of 5 stars;Almost nothing good about this product;I'll start with the things I like, it's a short list.  I like the length and versatility of this system. Now on to the dislikes, the charging is weak and typically takes a full 24 hours to charge an iPad or tablet.  I use good wall chargers, so that's not the problem.  Also, compared other charging chord, including the original manufacturer cables and they all charge at around half to a third of the time it takes this charger to charge a device.  Next, the durability is poor.  It hasn't been a year and the USB A portion of the cable has separated, leaving the wiring exposed.  I haven't seen this kind of poor quality in any other cable I've bought, and I've bought a good number of cables. It didn't just happen to one of the cables, but to 2 out of the 4 cables (the 2 I used the most often before just giving up on the whole thing). Finally, the magnet and the receiver do jot always seem to mesh well, to the point where I needed to determine if the device was even charging before I left the device alone, and I also needed to be careful to put down the device or the cable may stop actually charging.  The magnet stayed in place, so it wasn't a matter of the cable coming off, but seems like the placement of the magnet was important to allow the flow of power to recharge.  If you see this item on sale, there's a good reason, someone wants to sell the worst cable system out there to get rid of their inventory.  This product should be a free promotional that you get for signing up with a bank or something.  I expect those items to be of poor quality and break easily.  Seriously, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, look for something else. Your welcome!
2.0 out of 5 stars;BLUE LASER light!;Very nice and light weight, easy to use. It would get 5 stars!... Except1) i deducted 1 star because it does NOT transmit data! BooHoo. This means i have to swap tips/cables whenever i want to transmit data! In the case of my main phone this is frequent: basically every time i take more pictures -- i back them up on the Hypercube by Sanho (Sold on AZ as https://smile.amazon.com/Sanho-HyperCube-Backup-iPhone-Android/dp/B0833F366K )2) i deducted 2 stars because they used an obnoxious bright BLUE LED to indicate power. This is ALWAYS on. Do NOT have one in your bedroom... When you are awake and working, it is probably ok to have one two or three miles away, behind closed doors. i would not guarantee it (did i say it is BRIGHT?) though.my partial solution to the above issue was to use RED fingernail polish. i applied this to the shank end where the LED shows. When it was tacky i wrapped newsprint over that. (See the attached photo)This workaround, mostly, hides the shanks light bleed ... but does nothing for where BLUE light shines brightly out the connector end:-((( Fortunately, in use, that is mostly obscured by being on a tip. Storage times can be worked around by attaching it to a ferrous surface.They (whoever was the manufacturer of this cable) could have fixed it, saved our eyes and used much less carbon by using a much fainter red LED!i would say BOYCOTT them ... but sadly i do not see a competitor using anything else. i guess the Chinese have it in for Westerners eyes. Everything! is gratuitously augmented with BLUE LASER light!
4.0 out of 5 stars;What a great charging system;It is so nice to grab my phone and not be concerned that I am going to rip out the power cord. It connects well, charges without a fuss, and has all the connectors you will need. Glad I got it.The good: magnetic connection, a variety of connectors and cords.The disappointment: the plug for the power in the bottom of the phone has a dimple that stick out, now it will not sit up in my cup holder. Also the plugs diameter is larger than the case slot for my phone and tablet. i had to cut the case to make room for the plug.What I would Like: a variety of cord lengths for optional power placement.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Does not quick charge;ProsThese are quality, well built cords. Very solid. I like the concept as my son's iPad power port broke due to his using it while plugged in. These eliminate stress to the port so, good.ConsThey do not support quick charging. If you're using your device while connected, it will hardly charge at all. The lights on the ends make them handy to find in the dark but, they are very bright if using them in a bedroom.Sadly, I've abandoned them as they just don't do the job, quality build tho they are
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good for accessories.;"Good if you have a bunch of relatively low utilization gadgets in your bag with a mixed lot of micro USB and C charge ports. Good for topping off before you go or overnight. Mainly used to cure the micro USB non-symmetrical charger port scourge that afflicts all of humanity at this point.I got it for some ear buds, gamer sized noise cancelling head phones, data only cell hot spot, small media consumption tablet and its Bluetooth keyboard case, wireless game controller, Bluetooth speaker and a power bank.Not usable if you want data as well, or for a USB C negotiated ""turbo"" charge. I have seen it handle1.25+ amps so plenty good enough for a lot of stuff."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good product, very bright light;I love the system, but I hate the light. I use these cords to charge my ear buds and cell phone at night. I have wrapped the ends in electrical tape to dull the bright, blue, light of day that the end emits. If your device comes detached in the night, the tip will blast a beam of light across your eyes and bedroom. It’s bright. It bothers me.
3.0 out of 5 stars;They are not strong;I thought the magnetic part would be stronger and I could actually lift my phone while on the charger you can only if you're very gentle. Unless you buy enough to have them all around the house and in the car it's not worth it. I have went to charge my phone multiple times and had to go find pliers to pull out the piece that stays in your phone because I realized I couldn't find the magnetic charger and had to use my other chargers. Other than that they work they do what they're supposed to do but I'm not a fan
3.0 out of 5 stars;It stopped charging after a week;Stopped working one week after i purchased
4.0 out of 5 stars;Magnetic works;Magnet not strong enough but works
3.0 out of 5 stars;Poor Quality, Okay Charging, Strong Magnets.;The quality is pretty poor and charges slower than a normal charger. Is a lot more convenient if you're constantly on the move or just lazy.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works perfectly for what I wanted.;"My Samsung S10e would every once in a while give me a ""check your cable connection"" error regardless of using my home or work charging cable. Concern that constantly plugging a USB C cable in was ruining the port led me to this product. I don't have to worry about damaging my connection port anymore.No, it doesn't work for data transfer. But I read the Q&A and wasn't expecting it to.No, it doesn't offer super fast charging. I still get a full charge on my phone in 1 to 2 hours, so I'm not complaining.The only thing I can say negatively about this product is that I've had it for less than 2 months and my first USB C jack went bad. Phone still showed that it was charging but was losing power rather than recharging. Swapped it with another USB C jack (includes 4) and it worked perfectly fine again."
1.0 out of 5 stars;DO NOT BUY - TOTAL JUNK RIP-OFF;"Product advertises ""strong magnetic absorption""""30000+ Antishedding test Not Easy to fall off"" with a picture of someone holding the phone up by the phone cord and the phone staying attached by its magnet.  SO NOT TRUE!  One slight tug on the cord and the magnet detaches from the charger. There is no way you could possibly hold the phone up in the air by the cord, the magnet is not strong enough.  This is so bad. I feel it like it's something you could buy in the Dollar tree dollar stores.  I am returning this product This is the worst purchase I've bought in a long time.  Pros: the cord seems strong and durable, the rotational mobility of the connector is good it swivels 180° but you must do it gently or The magnet disconnects. The LED light is a nice feature. Well it would be a nice feature if the charger worked the way they say it should"
2.0 out of 5 stars;Short life;I really loved these, Howerton they don’t last long. Had them a day or two over 30 days. Two of these spot working😡😡
3.0 out of 5 stars;Functional and convenient but...;Works, but the magnets are not nearly as strong as the picture suggest. I turn my phone over to check the time and can easily knock the cord off my S9. Stronger magnets and these would be great, but as is, I will use them but will not buy again.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Magnetic charging cables;I use them to charge all of my equipment that charges with USB cords from my phone to speakers. Haven't had one come off on it's own yet. Better than trying to plug in the other way.
3.0 out of 5 stars;OK for the price, but understand the limitations.;Having used similar magnetic cable adapters in the past, I see both pros and cons to this product.Pros:Good selection of cable lengths and plentiful tips.Sturdy and simple design (other more complex systems have broken on me over time).Cons:Really only good for low power charging (only getting ~0.5 amp at 5v).No data (two pin only system, simpler and more reliable but no data options).No fast charge.No tip removal tool included (other similar products include a small plastic pry tool).
4.0 out of 5 stars;Loved the concept;I loved the concept. It’s very convenient to have cable every where for all your devices, instead of looking for a different charging cable every time you need to charge a different device.I feel like the durability could be better. After 10 days of use a cable got damaged by it self. The side that attaches on the phone lost contact with phone  and couldn’t be able to charge the phone any more. Looks like something has melted from the cable. So far, it happened with just one cable and the box came with 4 or 5cable. So, for me the product deserves 4 stars because the price is so affordable.I’m happy with it.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Problems with second set purchased;Absolutely love the first set that I purchased. I needed more iPhone connectors and instead of buying just the connector pack figured I would get new cables and connectors for a few bucks more.Problem is the new connectors have a wider disk than the old connectors dead and apparently that is a problem with a combination of connectors and new and old cables. New & old cables don’t reliability work when mixing old & new connectors.A big frustration was that we did not figure this out for quite some time and would randomly have charging issues. It was not until my wife’s phone sparked one attaching the cable to the connector that I looked closely and figured out what appears to be the problem.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Atvthe moment everything is ok and no problems;I haven't had a issue magnets working good
5.0 out of 5 stars;Easy on cell port;Love sizes.  Also variety of ends that fit different ports.  Like light at end of cord when on except I have a parrot take the cord off.  She also takes the magnet in the port out.  Love being able to easily disconnect too.  2nd or 3rd set (cats and birds chew on cords)
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great for charging, bad for data;The only thing I didn't quite understand when I bought this is how it works. They've basically removed a lot of the data lines from the charging cord, this means while it's a reliable, and easy to use power cord, you can no longer link music to your car via usb if you use this, nor can you update/backup your phone from the computer with this cord. That being said, it's a fast enough charge, it's convenient, the adapters for your devices barely stick out, meaning they don't catch on things, and the glowing tip of the charger means it's easy to find even at 2am in a dark room.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Almost perfect;I’ve been using there cables for about a week. The 1 ft. long cable isn’t useful for me. I’m really liking the 90 degree charger. I didn’t realize that the tips are to remain in your devices. The Lightning tips are particularly difficult to remove. As a ride-share driver, I was hoping to use this with my customers that need a quick charge during a ride. I don’t think that would be practice. Another downside is that Apple CarPlay won’t work with these cables.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Charges well;I've had this magnetic charging cable for a short time, but so far it works well.  I like the fact that the part that plugs into the port is separate from the cord so there should be less chance of damage to the port.  One thing I don't like is the brightness of the light because it would keep me awake at night if I didn't strategically hide it when I go to bed.  It is necessary to make sure the pieces are attached well in order for the device to charge properly, but I think that's to be expected, although they can come apart when trying to hide the light at night.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Works on my sons tablet, but is very finicky and has to be just right to quick charge;I bought this because my son keeps bending the charger when he plays with it while charging. I hoped the magnet was stronger but it comes off easily and while my son is able to put it back on its so finicky with placement it has to be just right to charge properly.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Disappointed with these;The length of the cords are great and all the pieces do fit and work. The biggest down side which left me very disappointed is that these dont charge well. I plug my phone in at night with 20% left and when I wake up nearly 7 hours later it only charged to 60%. I turned off fast charging and the charging just worse. I tried all the different tips and still same issue. Not sure if I got bad cables or what but I do feel ripped off.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Tried this because it was cheaper.;I got these to charge a phone, tablet, and ear buds. They work great at first, however they quickly fell apart. 3 of the 4 came apart with a few months. I tried the name brand sets for a few dollars more and they seem to be holding up way better and seem to be a better designed product.
5.0 out of 5 stars;wouldn't charge my Chromebook.😢;I really love this product. The USB ends fit all of my devices perfectly. My phone [Samsung Galaxy 3] in less than 45 mins, not the usual several hours in the wall charger. I do have an extended battery, 4500 mAh [?] in it. Works on my Kindel great also. The magnet is strong enough to dangle my phone from it but haven't tried my Kindel yet. On my ASUS Chromebook Flip C302 2-In-1 Laptop- 12.5”  the USB fits fine, but a message says it's too low of a charge. I don't know if a different adapter would help that or not. Bummer, but it's okay.For the price, with everything you get it's well worth the money. The shipping was fast, in fact, it came a day early. Can't complain about that. 😉 I can and do recommend this product and company.
4.0 out of 5 stars;They are ok;Bought for my tablet, worked great, not sure how long I had it though but it got a short in the cord on the tablet end, I might buy another.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good but......;I love magnetic charging cables because they solved several problems.  My husband always got so much pocket lint in his charging port that he couldn't get a good connection.  Leaving the magnetic phone connector in the phone solved that problem.  The magnetic cables connect quickly and easily and find the phone connector without even looking.  The only problem we had with this brand is that the phones connector didn't fit snuggly so it fell out often  and/or stayed on the cable.  He quickly lost all the phone connectors that came with the set. It frequently fell out when in the car holder and he was trying to charge the phone.  The cable lengths were ok but the short one needed to be a tad longer for our use and the long ones were a bit too long for us.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good overall but it seems it won’t work with Apple.;So while using it I’m starting to see it not work really well it seems this is more of an issue with Apple connection. But usb C and micro might seem to work flawlessly. When I charged my AirPods it was well but it just stops and when I was going to use them they were low. Also on my iPad won’t charge once I connect the charger. I had to take out the insert and plug it in with the magnet cable to make it charge. But my hyperX clouds work well I connect them and they charge. I’m testing to see if it works on my beats and v-moda headphones and see if they charge them. But so far as it seems the lightning connection will not work in the long run!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Charging issue;The charge is quite slow if not in a perfect position and it's easily knocked out of place. I was looking for a charfer that swiveled for this reason and gir this by mistake. The blue light is quite bright and annoying for me at night.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works well and charges fast;Product works perfectly at the moment (one week) and charges my phone and my gfs phone, no problem. Magnet is cool but isn't as strong as the video led me to believe. It does hold the weight of my phone with a protective case however my gf has a newer case and the charge port cover has too much memory retention and pushed the magnet off if moved quickly. Also when the cable is plugged into power the end of the cord lights up. Cool...ehh but is bright at night. I covered with tape and all is good. I like that it came with multiple lengths and overall the product seems to have good build quality and will update if anything changes.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great use, great value;"Works really well. Protects the charging port from yank-damage, which was my main reason for choosing. I've been pleasantly surprised at how much easier it is to plug up to charge. It doesn't turbo charge my moto phone, and my tablet says ""slow-charging"" when I use it. However it seems to charge my phone satisfyingly fast, and does charge the tablet up, just if the battery gets too low I have to take out the adapter and use the charger it came with (in a location my kids can't yank the cord!!)Biggest issue, the magnet picking up micro debris. My car charger tip falls to the ground by my feet like any charger, but the magnet picks up teeny sandy bits of ferrous rocks that my shoes track in. It's hard to get out and interferes with the charger."
3.0 out of 5 stars;Sadly, a Very slow charge;Delivery was fast. Packaging arrived intact.  I picked the appropriate cord length from the variety provided along with the correct adaptor plug for my phone.  Began charging.  2 hrs later my phone was not fully charged.  My regular charging cord charges my phone in approx. 15-20 minutes.  The magnetic charging cord is a great idea for less wear and tear on the charging slot, and perhaps I've just chosen a slower brand.  My daughter loved the one she purchased.  I love the concept of this. But I did not get great results.  For now I'm sticking with my regular charging cord.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Hot to the touch;Warning... the cord end housing gets hot to the touch. After I noticed this on one cord my son keeps plugged into his ipad mini, I checked the rest and they were all hot. I immediately stopped using these cords for safety concerns, I'd kinda rather my place didn't go up in an inferno because of cheaply made Chinese products. I won't even bother contacting customer support as these cords look exactly like other listed 'brands' which to me says they're manufactured all together and different 'companies' buy them, rebrand them & distribute them with little to no knowledge of the product so they can't offer any tech or quality control support but rather free replacements as they buy them so cheaply in bulk it's more cost effective plus it makes them appear to be a good company who cares about customer happiness.Aside from that, this product is an amazing idea!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Work fine but ...;Their magnetic tips ARE NOT compatible with other brands. Buy all cables and tips at once.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good;Product is as advertised however the blue lighted end is too bright for night charging. It will keep you awake. Also if you need data transfer this cable is not the correct one as it is for charging only.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Magnet holds.....too bad the cable won't stay in the charging port.;I had these recommended in a cycling group I belong to in order to help keep mud/water from getting into the bottom of my GPS unit.  Since the charging piece stayed inside the port, it would keep the bad stuff out but still let me easily connect the charging cable with one hand while I was riding.  I was very disappointed in these cables.I got the cables and went to try them out right away.  I am using a Hammerhead Karoo 2 GPS unit and my current phone is a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, both are USB-C ports.  I put the receiving end into the GPS port and it immediately fell out!  I tried a second cable with the same results.I grabbed my phone to see if, for some odd reason, the ports were different sizes (never heard of that happening, but stranger things have happened)...no luck, the cable immediately fell out of my phone as well.  Very disappointing.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Easy to use;The variety in length of the charging cords is great. I like the blue light alot as it can help find the cords in the dark. There are two reasons I am not giving it 5 starts. The first is that the part that plugs into the phone can be fickle, it fits like a glove but only works about 80% of the time its been but into an iphone or ipad and requires it to be removed and reinserted potentially multiple times for it to actually work. The second is with the magnet, while it doesn't detach with picking up or waving around your phone a simple brush up or tug on the cord removes it (too easily in my opinion).
4.0 out of 5 stars;Worth it!!;The cords are great quality and arrived on time in fantastic condition. My only complaint is that the magnetic connection wasn’t as strong as I was hoping. Don’t get me wrong as they are by no means flaky but I can’t lift my phone up by the cord without it dropping off. However, with the ability to keep the small connectors in each device (which fit very securely) saves all my devices from the wear and tear of constant plugging and unplugging which now extends the life of my devices. I totally recommend this product and this brand.
4.0 out of 5 stars;No Sync;To start positive the cables so far appear strong. Then magnetic connectors are strong and stay on. The shortest cable is useless unless where you plan on connecting it is right next to the phone. My plan was to use the shortest one when my phone is mounted in my truck. It’s the perfect length to hook up to my stereo for the Apple Car Play. My stereo does not recognize this cable which makes it useless in my truck. That is the biggest issue I have with these cables. They are great for charging, but syncing is half the reason I bought them.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great for Charging Only;These magnetic cables work pretty well for just charging your phone.  If you need to connect to your computer and transfer data forget it!  No data transfer with these at all, PC will not recognize the device unless you use a regular USB to Type C (or whatever you use) cable.  It will charge the battery but NO DATA.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Awesome cord. Not much of a kick.;I like the cords. I love the magnetic attachments. I just wish it would charge my phone quicker. My tablet and 2 other house hold accessories do well . . . .  🤷‍♂️
3.0 out of 5 stars;Convenient but bad quality;"The good: these are very convenient. When driving it's great to be able to click it on rather than having to fumble around. The blue light is cool. There are different cord lengths for different situations and many tips to choose from.Now the bad: charging is slow (which isn't too much of an issue since I do it overnight). I've had the product a little over 2 months and one of the ""tips"" that was in my cell phone fell apart (pic). I'm not rough on my cell phone - it's either on the couch next to me or in my purse or back pocket.I didn't pay much money for this product, but it would be nice to get a least a years use out of it before things start falling apart. At least there are many extra tips."
4.0 out of 5 stars;It works;The magnet on the phone side goes bad faster than the cord
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works Great;These are brilliant. I liked that it comes in 4 different lengths making it easy to find the right job for each length of lead. It also comes with plenty of plugs so I have put them on my watch charger base, phone, and a couple of power bricks.The cables are lovely and flexible and feel good quality.The only reason I gave it 4 not 5 stars is the blue LED light. It looks good and lets you know the lead has power. However if you're charging your phone at night on your bedside table it can emit enough light to be disruptive to falling asleep.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Inaccurate sales pitch: GONE WRONG, GONE WILD.;I see about if people nagging about the day charging ability sucking. They're not wrong, these arent the best for charging battery packs, but my Moto e5 plus charges pretty fast and it displays Turbo charge enabled. It's probably just the apple ones that suck if I'm being honest.I'm very disappointed that they lie about how many magnet chargers you get though. It says 4 of each on the picture, and the description, but they only give you 2 of each inside a little plastic tub.The actual magnetic cables are fairly sturdy. And the first thing to fall is likely going to be the magnetic end of the phone ripping the magnet out of the charging dock.Wouldn't really recommend if you're super picky, but having multiple cables is nice I guess.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Convenient, but not reliable.;I have owned LOTS of these magnetic charging cables over several years.  I'll keep it brief:PROS:- Convenient.  Easy to attach/detach without risking damage to the cable or your device.- The small magnetic dongle stays in your device's charging port, shielding it from dust/damage.- Charging speed isn't bad.CONS:- Frail.  I have had to re-buy the cables several times because they fail after just a few months' normal use.- The cable ends have obnoxiously bright LEDs that never turn off.  If you plan to charge anything at night, it will keep you awake unless you cover up the LEDs with tape, paint, heat shrink, etc.- Keeping track of all the different little dongles can be a pain.- If the magnetic end of the cable is hanging free and contacts a metal magnetic surface, it can short out whatever USB charging port you have it connected to.  This destroyed one of my USB car chargers once.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Apple Users, Beware!;"DOESNT ACTUALLY CHARGE!! I bought these so I could refrain from the hassle of using a wireless charger and moving my phone around constantly. I have an iPhone 11 and these cables came brand new to me just today. I plugged in the cable, LED was on and had the port in, everything is going good right? Next I hooked the two together and my phone doesnt light up with the charging screen. So I went back to my apple charger and checked again, the screen came on. So somehow all the cables and connectors are not charging at all for my phone. The magnets are also not very strong and you cannot hold your phone by your cord, it will drop. I would also like to say that the packaging is pretty tacky, its pretty much a white box and a slapped on label that just says ""Charge Cables"". Since I could not get my phone to charge I will assume that the charging power is absolutely garbage. Everything today is fast charging, spend an extra few dollars to make fast charging and WORKING CONNECTORS. The idea is innovative and I would like to come across it again, but it's extremely hard to find magnetic chargers for iPhone products. Using a wireless charger can also get troublesome since it has to sit on a flat surface somewhere. I am a person who does not own a bedside table nor enough power outlets to put one somewhere conveniently. I am disappointed and will be calling for a refund."
2.0 out of 5 stars;Good concept if work well;I have been testing this cable for a few months. I noticed that when using them, the mobile phones get overheated. I have to turn them off for couple of minutes until cool down. I changed back to normal USB to USB-C and under the same conditions the phones didn't overheat. So it seems like there is something wrong with the bit connected to the phone and the head of the cable that made the phones to overheat.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Bad Design, Poor Quality;I thought these would be great but the first one failed in about a week followed by anther about two weeks after the first one failed. The remaining two are still working after several months. purchased in early July 2021.Additionally, the design of the tip makes it quite easy for it to short out when connecting it to my devices. They regularly make my charger shut off for a few seconds as it senses the short from not having it perfectly aligned when connecting.
2.0 out of 5 stars;These charge really slow!!;The cables are nice and the connect easy but they charge very slowly. It takes these cables 3.5 hours to charge my phone versus my plug in cable which only takes 34min!!!
3.0 out of 5 stars;These inserts break easily;I love the concept of this product, when working they work great.Issues:Apple connector broke off in the phone while trying to remove - GOOD WARRANTY new ones were sent free of charge, but a pain to remove from the charge port.USB-C connector broke into pieces when the phone (in an otterbox) fell to the floor. Phone, Screen protector and Otterbox were fine the USB-C connector cracked into pieces, and had to be removed and replaced. It landed on the top corner of the phone not the connector.All in all good concept, bad durability.
2.0 out of 5 stars;I can attest that they're magnetic;They are magnetic, I can certainly agree to that.  My phone tells me how long it's going to take to get a full charge, though, and when the new cables come out of the box and I'm shown that the full charge time is going to be THREE TIMES (yes, 3x) the older cables that I'm trying to replace...well, guess what's going right back in the box.No complaints with the cable lengths.  Won't be able to talk about the durability.  They do seem to be sturdy braided cables, but...they're back in the box, so...
4.0 out of 5 stars;Best charger ever (if the blue light can be shut off);This can be used as a universal charger. I got rid of those redundant but different charge cables since now I can just plug those charging heads in and leave them there. The cords are covered in durable plastic threads so no more worn-out cables for Apple products. The only feature that I don't like is that its blue lights cannot be turned off. I really hope they have this option since I tend to leave the charging port on a socket, and that means the blue light will be always on--this can be a waste of energy though. Other than that, this is a great product and I really enjoy it.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Pointless;The charger worked, the magnet was okay, the main problem i ran into is if you have a magnet in your charging port, anytime you use a different non magnet charger you have to take the little magnet piece out of your phone and make sure you don’t lose it.  To me if you don’t change all of your chargers to these magnet chargers it’s not worth it. It’s truly a gimmick. Also i don’t like having something in my charging port at all times, it’s not worth it if my phone gets damaged because of it.
4.0 out of 5 stars;THIS IS A GREAT CONCEPT, however.....;It does take a very long time to charge , which I can deal with when charging overnight.  One of the cables stopped working after just over two months.I let the company know and they are sending me a replacement with apologies and wanted feedback on the cables, so gave them a 4 star and will up it to 5 if the cables last a while.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Product title and description not accurate;Listen… this product is an innovative idea and design but can’t attest to durability and value since it didn’t work as advertised. If you have a smaller power device it works great like a controller or headphones but not a mobile device. And we all know the usability of everyone needing a good charge for your phones. But it says it works on iDevices but no combo of connectors or cables worked on any of my devices.So I’m short I wasted my time replacing my first purchase with this second one and now maybe the third time is the charm? Or I go with a standard lightning cable… they ought to update their product title and description. A newer iPhone takes about 1A - 2A and the product says it charges at a max of 2A so slow charge or fast charge as the descriptions states… it still doesn’t work as reviewed by others a few years ago.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't connect to car;Okay, so, a few issues. First, they start off fast charging, but then it goes to slow charging unless you keep disconnecting and reconnecting. It once said it would take 9 hrs to charge my phone. Even on a constant video call, a regular cord can charge my phone still.Another issue, they don't connect to my car for navigation/spotify/etc and again with the drastically slow charge times.I had wanted to use these on my phone and other devices to keep from having to clean ports all the time. I guess back to searching for a better cord.The connection is great, fairly stable, etc. The plug for phone/device is great. A little difficult to get out, but it's meant to stay for awhile so I actually liked this part. The cords, not so much. Glad they were cheapish, just hope to find a better cord that will fit the end.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Weak magnet/connector lose;The magnet is not as strong as they would lead you to believe. I've lost several of the inserts that go into device as they have just fallen out. It does charge all of my devices. It does come with multiple inserts and the multiple length cords as shown. Overall happy with the product as was my mother who received this as a gift from me.
5.0 out of 5 stars;They work great;I was having trouble with the USB-C connector on my phone - it only worked in one direction.  This has solved my problems and I've now installed the adapters on all my rechargeable devices other than my laptop.  Bought 2 sets initially.  I liked them so much I bought another.  Maybe my phone is heavy but I cannot (nor should I) lift my phone by the cord.  Nevertheless, the magnets are powerful.  I never have issues with them not connecting properly or falling off.  Also, I've read reviews complaining about throughput/charging speeds.  I don't know how to quantify it but I'm really happy with the charging speeds I get.  I run my phone at full brightness for GPS in my car.  When I get to work, my phone is at 100% even if I leave my house at 75%.  I'm happy.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Great in theory poor execution.;Great cord length in various sizes and connectors for all your charging needs. If you use this for standard fixed charging it’s great but the magnets are not strong enough to handle to much moving around. This goes into the next downfall. The magnetic circle completes the circuit so if it is damaged or loose at all throw out the damaged part. My phone started sparking due to a crack in the magnetic ring when I took it off the ring broke free and the adapter had suffered mild melting damage. It’s slow to charge needed 5 hours to fill a iPhone 8 to full charge if it’s in use while plugged in it will not fully charge. Overall would be great if magnet was stronger and charge was faster. I think the magnetic ring may have a big part to play in the slow charging. Overall look elsewhere.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Does not stay connected. Finicky.;Edit. Company is replacing the broken cord and the other cords work fine so i have adjusted my rating up to a 4 star rating.As of right now one of the 6 foot cords constantly connects and reconnects and doesnt charge fast enough. Tried multiple blocks and tested other standard usb cables with the blocks and they worked. Have not tested the other 3 cords the kit came with will update my rating once i try them but based on the first cord i may be returning these and the second order of them i bought yeaterday.
2.0 out of 5 stars;So much for that;Low charge capacity,  weak magnets.  Definitely not how it was advertised
3.0 out of 5 stars;Worked for a few weeks;Love the concept.  Very convenient but they started to overheat after a few weeks of use.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Does not work with Android Auto;Did not work with Android Auto to connect my phone to the car system. Could not use Maps, etc, while using these cords -which was the reason I bought them. I had to go back to a non-magnetic cord to use Android Auto in my car.  My husband uses them just for charging, and they work fine for that. (It did take a while for him to get used to the bright blue light at night when he plugged his phone in in the bedroom. We ended up putting something over the charging light on the end of the cord.). He does like the fact that he doesn't have to mess with plugging in cords, he just leaves the magnetic end in his phone all the time.
2.0 out of 5 stars;iphone users beware, the tips don't fit;"I have an iphone 12, and the included ""i-Product"" tips have one side coated black and they don't stay in, don't fit. Returned same day as received."
3.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charging on any device. Phone will show constant notifications that you are charging slowly.;Due to the two wire system that this is using, it cannot charge quickly. Fine for devices other than cell phones.
2.0 out of 5 stars;lasted 4 months;The design is fine. The magnets jump into place better than advertised. It does charge devices. In short it works good.EXCEPT that it melted. The plastic melted on the cable. The cable is plugged in 24 7. It wasn't even connected to a device, but the plastic end melted and died.Disappointing.Also, no data with this cable. This cable only charges.Assuming it doesn't melt. It would be good for simple usb devices that require electricity and not data transfer (phones)
4.0 out of 5 stars;Problem;This was a bit of an oversight on my part, but the circular base where the magnets connect don't fit my electronics. I'll be returning these for something a bit more flatter. I was planning on putting these on my airpod case and phone and iPad and battery pack etc, but if anything has a case on it the circle doesn't work out too well. I love the way the tips came packaged. Everything was like described just didn't think my purchase all the way through. Whatever your uses are, the circle might be more practical for 360 rotative use, but not for me who has cases for everything.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Only CHARGES, if you want to exchange DATA, save your old cord!;"I can't believe in order to use this weakazz cord for data, I have to pull out the little mini dongle every time I want to exchange/accesss my phone data data.  HANG ON TO YOUR OLD CORD!  This thing is  slow.  I kept getting a message "" Slow Charge Warning! , Use the original cable for a fast charge"".  The stupid light stays on 24/7????  It should ONLY come on ( like so many other products)  WHEN IT IS CHARGING. Thats  the ONLY time the blue light should light up.  When it hits 1000% the stupid light should go OFF, letting you know really easy your all done, ready to go.  Falls off way too easy. Only 1 cord spins?  Poor design"
4.0 out of 5 stars;Darn good cables and customer service;I have a Razer Phone 2 and it is notorious for having charge port issues so I got this so I didn't have to plug in and out so much. I got 12 tips and 4 cables in the pack. It came with everything advertised. I really liked the right angle cable for bed but it wasn't working correctly. I got in contact with customer service and they got back to me within a couple hours about sending me a replacement. I got the replacement in 3 days and the new one is working just fine.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Just o.k.;The cords feel like they're going to last a long time. However, the longer they are, the longer it takes to charge. The 3 foot cable I bought initially charges my phone in six-ish hours when the battery percent is at 10% or less. These longer cords take twice as long or longer.They seem to disconnect rather easily, also. I cannot have the side charge cable connected while using my phone.They work fine for the kids kindles and electronics that can sit in the charging dock station.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Best invention ever, these will change your life!;These are awesome, we just converted all our charging cords in the house and cars to these and I couldn’t be more pleased. I don’t have to take my hands off the wheel while driving to finagle around to plug the charger into my phone, now it’s a quick one hand swipe to put my phone port near the cable and the magnet hooks right up to it, no fuss! Plus if it’s dark, the end of the cable has a blue light so you can easily find it. My boyfriend use to break charging cords all the time by shoving the end into the phone and being too rough with the cheaply made ones they sell these days. This has solved our problems and I’m so thankful to whoever came up with this idea!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Very easy and convenient to use;Works with 3 devices each using a different connector. The first order was for 2 cables they worked so well I ordered the 4 cable package. Now all our devices use the same common connection. We have a cable in each car, on each nightstand and in 2 central locations in our house.The charging rate is virtually unchanged from the original cables. Each cable has a blue led mskingbit easy to find in the dark. Simply place the cable near your phone/tablet and the magnets will make the connection.Unlike the ad, the magnets are not strong enough to remain attached to the cord when you hold them up by the cord.An update: after 2 years, one of the connectors pulled apart from constant use. But these cables are so convenient I immediately ordered a replacement.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Really good product I’m impressed;Really good product I’m impressed Their ability and everything of this product is really good good quality but it’s a slow charge if you have a first charge brick you will have no problem I have one it’s helping really good it’s really fast it’s 20W brick it’s enough
2.0 out of 5 stars;Worked well until it didn’t;I got these for my kids tablets so that they wouldn’t damage the charging ports and we’d have universal chargers. They worked so well that I used them for my things as well, for the vehicles and in the home office…well 5 months later and all devices now say “not charging”. What really sucks is that they stopped working on a road trip and these are the only chargers that we brought for the kids
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice idea;It looks like a decent set of cables. They are very pliable and supple with a cloth coating instead of plastic.  I bought them for the right angle, but that cable will not work with my iPhone in an Otter box case...I'm also trying to avoid blue light at night, and the light on the end of the cable is blue...Another concern is that the box the cables come in warn that your phone should be turned off during charging or there is a risk of fire... seriously, who does that?
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect!!!;This has been one of the Best Buy’s for our phones, the quality is great, charging power/time is great and only one cord is short but I can still use it in my truck.Not having to worry about breaking my charging port is a good feeling, and also my phone gets protection from dust and other particles that could damage it. I 100% recommend this product.I have a few friends that already bought this product and loved it.
4.0 out of 5 stars;The jury is out;Just received product. It seems to be working well for charging. Not sure what the purpose of having an LED on it is for. Maybe to let you know that it is plugged in or maybe easier to find in the dark? Was unsuccessful trying to transfer data with this cable between phone and computer. Computer did not discover device and phone did not offer option to treat cable as Data, as does with other cables, so... charging only with this cable.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Work a try;I'm not exactly sure of the durability because I received the package & 2 of them were broken. I used 1 that wasnt  broken on my Note 9 & my husband used the other 1 on his IPhone 10. It worked well. We used it for a few days then I requested a replacement. I'm going to give it a shot it is a better price point then some of the other magnetic chargers and you get more cords for your money.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Gave it a medium rating;The 6 ft cord doesn't seem to consistently charge like it should. I tried using it on my tablet to charge overnight and it did not charge it up all the way to 100%. The other ones work great!
5.0 out of 5 stars;A Real Improvement;When the magnet in the end of the cord is brought close to the connection socket of the iPhone or iPad the two automatically connect. The two magnets just click together. Nothing to insert at all. I especially like this at night when I connect my iPad to the charging cable in the dark. And, of course, the lighted end of the cable makes this even easier. One thing to note, however, you can not use these cables to synchronize your devices.
3.0 out of 5 stars;A bad apple.;These won't work on my phones. I thought it would be nice to have a cord I could use for all phones, but none of them work on any phones in this house. (6 phones) I thought with that many cords and this many phones, my odds were good.  Not so. Seller was never notified.  I put them all back in the box and lost it. So that's my fault that I never got an exchange or refund. (The reason For giving 3 stars instead of one)
3.0 out of 5 stars;Mixed review;Had great hopes for this.  I use my iPad a lot while it is plugged in, and the standard charge cables wouldn’t hold up well.  I love the swivel feature - it prevents the cord from getting constantly bent and wearing out.  However, the magnet just isn’t strong enough to keep the cable attached.  It keeps falling away at any small bump.  Also, the cable charges VERY slowly.  I have only had it for a few weeks so I can’t speak for its durability, but so far, so good.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Don't have to unplug from phone, just pull on magnet.;Love these..I have bought several these, and for gifts too. Only problem when given as gifts, others don't know how to install them. There should be a guide that comes with them.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Great for athletes/outdoors/small electronics. *No data transfer*;Mainly bought it so I have a plug for protecting my charge port (I do a lot of running and cycling makes it easy to charge during long runs and rides and so I dont sweat into it). When I bought it a month ago it advertised data transfer (2nd reason why I got it) but now it's not, and an added REMINDER that it CAN'T do data transfer is now in the product description (I assume after a lot of angry reviews). Fast charging kind of works if you have a 3.0+ amp charging block anything lower is slow to charge. I will say its great for charging my running/cycling lights and PS4 controllers.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Magnets Are Great But No Quick Charge On Note 10;The magnets work great and connecting the cord is brilliantly simple. The cord length assortment is excellent and the number and variety of tips is sufficient. BUT, no fast charging on my Samsung Note 10 Plus.The cables themselves seem a little lightweight, but only time will tell on their durability. They are very flexible and covered in braid. The light up magnetic ends are a very welcome feature... always know when cable has power and makes it easy to find in the dark. Definitely not too bright where it would be an issue in a dark bedroom.Overall, I'm pleased with the cables and how they operate but I am also very disappointed in the lack of fast charge support as described. Considering returning due to that.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Why aren't these an industry standard?;These are the best! Most phones today the weakness is the charging port. Having only one hand from a stroke many years ago I'm extra hard on that part so this helps me be easier on that flawed part while assisting with all other electronics with the correct port(fire tablet and chargeable vape pens😍)thesetype of charging cables should automatically be included with every cell phone instead of the crap one that now comes with them all!👍
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good quality charging cords.;Well made. Long enough. The connector tip would have been more effective with a stronger magnet in it. 4 stars for that. Either way, it's better than others.
3.0 out of 5 stars;still not too certain that this is beneficial;The package included enough cable and plug-ins to justify the value. But I expected the magnets to be considerably stronger. They are not. The connection is way too easy to break free. Also, using the connection seems to lose certain functionality. Specifically, my Android Auto, which allows for onscreen navigation, and more, does not seem to work when connected via the Magnetic Charging Cable. That is a major iissue
4.0 out of 5 stars;Awesome charger!;I like how it glows blue when powered & charging! These are good magnetic chargers but a little bump or pull & the magnet detaches easily. A stronger connection/magnet would be amazing! This set has 4 charging cords, all different lengths & many magnetic tips for all devices. The tips come in convenient containers so they won't get lost.Overall a great value & great purchase!
2.0 out of 5 stars;"These are NOT ""fast charging"" cables.";"I like the fact that they are magnetic and come with many interchangeable tips. I hate the fact that they are advertised as 2.4A ""fast charging"" and simply aren't. They are passive cables, not powered. How did they measure the 2.4A? Was it hooked up to a 120V battery? I have my cables plugged into my 2.4A Samsung charger, an Anker 3.0A charger, and my UPS's 2.4A charger. All of them with every cable from the 2 6-foot cables to the 1-foot cable are all slow charging my devices. The battery charge actually went DOWN as I was writing this while charging my phone with these cables. I will be returning these. The 2.4A ""fast charging"" product description is an outright lie. Yes, this is the phone's original AC power adapter with this magnetic charging cable."
3.0 out of 5 stars;Slow change-unnecessary light;Charges super slow prob bc integrated light stealing some power.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Life Changing Product;These are amazing. I have an iPhone and my wife has a Samsung 9+ But thanks to these we can use the same charging cable in the car. My 5 year old can now easily charge her tablet and my wife can use the same cord for her Kindle as her phone uses. Amazing device that is well worth the purchase. I will be getting another bundle too!
4.0 out of 5 stars;It's great but needs more c plugs;I like everything the length,the charging time and the durability but it just did not come with enough c type plugs. Other than that this product is great,I  highly recommend it.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great for Android phones;I hooked up 3 of my cables for Android items.  Since the left over cables fit nothing I had I gave them to my friend who has an iPhone.  It fit her phone but would charge and then start draining the battery!  Quite possibly she had an older iPhone and this is what caused the problem.  We don't know why this occurred.  The last 3 cables are useless for me.  I would have preferred to have received 6 for Androids.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Don’t waste your money;Junk. The reason I wanted these was so I didn’t need to replace broken chargers. I really liked them at first and thought they were awesome. These should last forever compared to the plug-in chargers, but each one gets the same issue. The silver finish on the round magnet, which I believe is also the ground, wears off. Once it wears off stupidly quick, the charger is useless and though it hooks up, does not charge. In the included photo, you may be able to see the darker grey ring around the outside of the magnet. That is where it contacts the piece plugged into your device, and when that ring gets worn off, the charger no longer works. This one did not last very long. It happens on the little plug-in pieces too. They wear also, which ever wears first needs to be replaced. First it happened to the plug-in that I had in my phone, so I plugged in another, and the second wore pretty quick, but worked up to the point where it fell out and got lost. Then I started using it with my PS4 controller, and the finish on the magnet on my cord wore out and it wouldn’t charge. It’s cool, but not sure I’d buy again.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't Last;I was tired of having to replace lightning cables for my iPhones because of the contacts getting so worn they no longer charged. The reviews of this product looked good and the product did work decently at first. I started to notice that the magnetic strength decreased making solid contact harder to maintain. Now over the last week my phone barely charges, aka from 5% to  10% over night.
4.0 out of 5 stars;magnet pulls out easily;As long as you don't swing your device around, the cable will stay connected to your device.  I'd like a stronger magnet.  Also the adapter that plugs into your charging port is very hard to get out, so once you decide to use these cables, best to use only them.  Otherwise I'm pleased.  Can't really rate durability yet.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good product.;One of the magnetic plugs came broken but there are several more I can use. Otherwise a good product.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Magnetic charging cables for iPhone;It worked for a couple of days then just stopped working for some reason.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Will charge or download, but not at same time.;I bought these cables to use with my phone in my car. The plug for the phone only has contacts on one side, so you can either charge or stream music, but not both simultaneously. That is a little disappointing. Plug fits into the phone snugly, so it isn’t easy to switch it around for either purpose. On long road trips when using navigation and streaming music, it would be nice to be able to charge my phone at the same time.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works;Works, charges and easy to connect. It held intact but  the magnet  is not strong enough to keep it suspended hanging. As for durability, looks tough enough but it’s too early to say.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good and bad;They seem to work pretty well. You definitely have to make sure that you can use it with a case. My Ipad with case won't work but the one thing I do like is that my son's tablet is compatible. you know kids sometimes they'll run off and then rip it out or it gets loose well this takes away that problem. If you walks away it just automatically unmagnatizes.I would prefer the blue light to not be there though. Or at least turn off. If you're using it with a portable charging box the blue light will drain your battery.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Cleaned up my wire rats nest;Ordered this and more usb c and micro heads. Put it on every rechargeable items like Ps5, Xbox controller, mouse, keyboard and etc. just have 2 wires for all items. No more digging around for the right cables
3.0 out of 5 stars;Pros: works as described. Feels like quality cable.  Cons: LED light is bright!;Overall these are really good, they are generous with both cable sizes and tips.I haven't run any formal tests but I'm mainly using a cable to keep a Steel Series Arctis 7p charged. Seems to work well enough.Biggest issue/regret is that while it's good to know it's getting power, the blue ring light is much too bright.  I'm going to have to tape it up or write over it with marker. Next time I'll get a set with no lights or something.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Love Em...One has died;I have ordered three of these. I really like the way they work and have even given some to friends.Today I noticed one wasn't working. Seems the pin on the corded part has somehow worn away and not longermakes contact. I hope this is a fluke since I am using them exclusively for charging my devices now.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Not consistent.;There were four cables. Only three worked. The fourth one pooped out after two uses.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good cords but NO larger iPad plugs;"I'm happy with the cords, overall. But beware ... though the description says the cords come with tips for iPad, there are none for the older iPads (like iPad2) with the 1"" wide plugs. The description is a tad misleading. BUT I'm very pleased with the utility and quality of the cords. It's so nice to just lift the cords toward the device and snap ... it attaches. Much better than fussing with which side goes up on the micro USB, which can be difficult to see, especially in low light."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Charging Cable Magnetic 4 pac;Got this charger hoping the wiring is durable and led lit In case of a break. To early to Say if the charging time is faster than other chargers.The magnetic connection between cord and phone port is convenient, but connection is easily broken on the short cord. Over all a good experience with this product.
3.0 out of 5 stars;long cable charges too slowly;the short and medium cables are charging at decent speed but the longer ones are too slow.also they make too much light so you cant sleep in the same room with your charger.the magnetic gimmick is fun and very helpful in a time where your phone uses USB-C, headphones uses lightning, and other older devices are using micro USB
3.0 out of 5 stars;Great but USB C adapters keep breaking in half;Loved this product and still use it daily for charging micro USB devices. For a few weeks i used it to charge my USB C phone until the piece that was in the phone broke. Thought i must have been too hard on it so i put one of the other adapters in. 2 days later it broke in half as well. Would have easily been a 5 star product if the USB C adapters didn't keep breaking
5.0 out of 5 stars;Love these.;Very convenient, easy to use.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Poor quality;I thought these were just what I needed.  At first they were great but after a few weeks the cord will not stay on to charge, it falls off, the magnets lose power.  The cords are getting loose at the lighted magnetic ends so you have to move the end to get it to start charging again.  Good idea but these are of poor quality
2.0 out of 5 stars;Takes forever to charge -- do not recommend;I love the concept BUT -- it does not charge my devices very quickly. I think I had my phone charging on it for 2 hours and I barely got 25% battery life.Also, given the concept is that you can remove the cable and leave the charging jack in the port, this does mean it takes some fingernails to REMOVE the jack from the port if you need to use a different cable. The jacks are very small and they came in 2 small plastic containers but they could be easier lost -- especially for someone who fidgets with their phone. Anyone with a pop socket will understand -- you will be tempted to pop it free without thinking and potentially lose it. It does come with 3 jacks for each type but still.Most of all, my biggest disappointment is just how inefficient it is with charge speed. I have the cables set aside for just in case but I won't be using them for everyday charging.Do not recommend.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Can think of a few ways to improve but not much;Excellent charger and charger my j7 crown just fine. Charger port adapter even fit into my otterbox case wich I was not shure of and that was nice perfect for my mobile life style delivering uniforms but could use a slightly stronger magnet as the strate connectors tent too pop right off when bumped too much and my box van for delivers tends too bounce about a bit. All and all great product.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Some cables will charge some won't;Maybe 3 cables will charge, forget the rest. I did like that extra magnetic plugs were included. I'm not convinced that this product is all that good.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Unless I can buy just heads. Not worth it...;3 months in. 2 of the USBC heads have stopped working. There was no damage to the heads, they just failed to charge. Thankfully came with two more. But once those stop working we will need to either find more heads or get now chargers. While charging, the coupling does get warm to hot. And the charging is definitely slower than our other cords. Love the idea to protect your charging port. But need to work on the longevity of the product.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Convenient but not great for mechanical/warehouse environment;These cords make charging my phone when I'm in my car easy because I don't have to look for how it goes in. They also charge my phone fairly fast. They've been really great except for the fact that I work in a warehouse with lots of little bits of metal that find their way to the magnetic pieces and are hard to get off. Pro: proves how strong the magnets are Con: obstructs the charging capability.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not worth the Hype;It might just be me, but...i seem to lose the attached pieces that go in the phone. They fall out ?? Of my phone.. did find one at work on the floor, and in my car.  Also slower to charge?  Now trying a more durable one piece.  Product great concept, but need a more snug fit.
4.0 out of 5 stars;These don't work with Android auto;I wanted a magnetic charger for my android auto . These cords don't work with android auto.  But they are excellent for the fast charging and durable.  3ft cord was used.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Cool product;This is a great kit, with everything you need to get you set up charging multiple devices. The quality seems very good, looks nice. The blue light is a cool look, however I do have an issue with how bright it is, forcing me to unplug it at nice because it is too bright to sleep. Maybe if the light turned off when it wasn't connected to the phone that could help. Also my samsung s10+ doesn't show fast charge when connected to fast charge adapter
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good but not how I pictured it;I was over the moon initially,  I really like how you can use the same cable for different devices. The downside for me was the magnetic hold wasn't strong enough.  If you are just charging a device and not moving them around it does  work,  but when charging my phone or xbox controller and still using them,  slight movements would cause the cable to unlatch. Happened less often with the sideways L style charger but was happening to often for me to keep them.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good if you don’t use Apple car play;Was very excited to get these, the 1’ cord is perfect for the length needed in my car. Here’s my issue, the lightning port has to face a certain way because the connectors are on one side, that has to face the back of the iPhone. It charges fine but it doesn’t connect to my head unit so I can use Apple car play, think needs the connectors on both sides of the lightning connector to make car play work. So if you just need a magnetic charger it’s great, something to transfer data not so much. Very disappointing but also didn’t see a review about it working with car play.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Convenient;The concept of this item is amazing. So many different charging styles that covers pretty much any device you may need. The only disappointment was that the cable that was supposed to be 1ft long was maybe 6 or 7 inches so it is not useful since there’s usually always more than 6 inches from the outlet to the floor or table.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Makes Charging multiple Devices Easy;Pros:-All Cables and Adapters Included-Easy Use-Light Indicator (also Con) letting you know its actually workingCons:-Blue Light Indicator Very Bright especially in a Dark Room where you're trying to sleep-Doesn't Fast Charge
1.0 out of 5 stars;Great for those who often snag their charge cord.;This is a great solution for people who often walk away with their phone in their hand and forget the charging cord is still connected. The pieces that attach to the phone snap in nice and securely and this has allowed us to have just one cord in the car for three different types of phones instead of searching for three cords. So far they seem durable enough and I will update the post if that end up not to be the case. My only complaint is they only charge and do not work for data transfer. I am not taking a star off for that as I believe this would be too difficult to implement in this technology with a universal setup.Update: Two months in and these cables no longer work right. The magnets still attach but the cables don't consistently charge. My phone's screen touch sensitivity also acts funny and is not responsive when using these cables but, as soon as I disconnect them the screen returns to normal. However, I am not experiencing these symptoms with a normal charging cable. I suspect bad quality control or cheap construction has led to a short inside somewhere. I just hope my phone is not damaged.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great product, except....;I received the charging cables and was excited to try them out. I set them up in my home office and in my car. The adapter fits, even with my phone cases on them. The only drawback that I have to report is that the cables are NOT fast charging.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good but not super durable.;The durability of of this cord last for about a year and I bought a second set now because the first main cord I use is starting to act funny
4.0 out of 5 stars;Magnetic charging is the way to go;Very happy with the performance of the product.  I have an iPhone X, an iPad Pro(11-in), an iPad mini, and a MacBook Pro (13-in, 2019) and charging them using the magnetic charging  cable works like charm.  Really like not having to worry about damaging any of my devices by accidentally knocking them to the ground.  Wish it would work with CarPlay, but it doesn't.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Barely works.;The 6 foot cords don't work.  I can only charge my phone on the shorter cord.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Grat charger that always lights up;I love the idea behind these cables and they do charge! I love that they come in different sizes and with many adapters. They charge very well too but I just cannot do lights on chargers. I have light blocking curtains as I am very sensitive to the light so if you have this issue I do not recommend. If you dont, lucky! Enjoy!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not for me.;I liked the different cords but when I tried to charge my phone it would only stay on for a little while then just stop charging it. I would have to unplug it and wait a while before trying it again.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Either I got a bad batch or the actual charging prongs kinda suck.;The actual product great. I have almost all bad cords. If the prongs on the charger to mount are anything like mine then. Let me know if you experience the issue. It is flush and connected and you are suppose to be able to twist it while it stays in contact. NOPEEEE NOT MINE. Its like a 5 0/50 shot. Then once you get it its like a BOMB dont kove it. When I messaged about the issue to the seller the seller asked me to provide footage of the issue. Done that and nothing. So there is your answer everyone going back to my old charger.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Broke in less and 2 months;When I initially purchased these they worked great! The magnet made it easier for the kids to charge their IPad and it was easier to plug in when it was dark at night. The set came with 4 adapters that could be used for the iPhone or iPad and 4 wires.  One of the 4 adapters came damaged and never worked. The other 3 worked for less than a month each.  My husband also bought this same set so we had a total of 8 adapters. We are on our last 2 adapters and we have 3 devices so we need to purchase new charges less than 2 months later.  I expect that the last 2 adapters will work for another week or 2 and they will all be dead too. Would save you money.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Expect to replace after a year or so.;The convenience is nice and I will probably buy it again. It charges a bit slower and doesn't always make a solid connection, so I have formed the habit of looking at the charge indicator on the device before leaving it. As time and use progress the connection gets to the point where the cable side becomes less reliable and will lose contact even after checking the charging indicator on the device at which point the cable portion will need to be replaced.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Fast charging, as advertised, tips break fairly easily.;these are great! They do what i need them for and charge very quickly. They lost one star, because i find that the magnets on the piece that goes on your phone, do break fairly easily. I've managed to break 2 of them, and although they still charge it's hard to keep a connection. They give you several tips son this isn't that much of an issue, but something the company might want to look into as far as making them stronger.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Some cords are short;Some of the cords are too short to ever be of use. Most are a good leangth but who needs a 3 inch charging cord
4.0 out of 5 stars;Reliable fast charging;Does not work with everything. Not sure why but device piece might be a tad short for some devices to connect.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Charging cables are sketchy;I've purchased three sets of these over the past several months. I'd say about one-third of the charging cables actually work. The rest charge so slowly that the phone uses power faster than what the cables can charge. With the two-thirds of the malfunctioning cables, the phone only charges if it's turned off.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Don't let the ends pick up metal pieces;I loved these cords the minute I read about them  well everything is good with these cords untill the magnetic ends pickup little pieces of metal from everywhere. Once that happens and the metal connects negative to positive because the magnet don't know better you'll get a small spark and no more charge either the cord goes bad or what is being charged goes bad . I speak from first hand experience. Now I need to buy a new phone because mine nolonger charges!!!!!!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good for multiple device users;These are pretty great. I will be buying more even with the following negatives.They do not sync only charge.A small piece of one of the iPhone tips broke from a drop, it is still usable even with that small piece missing.All in all well worth the price and will continue to use.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good quality good for the money;Good quality, big variety to use with Samsung s8 and iPhone s6, the only reason I gave it 4 stars because I can't use it when I need Android auto or apple car app, then I  hav to use regular charger cable, and then you have to remove the magnetic tip from the, which is not very easy to do, otherwise it's a very good product....
2.0 out of 5 stars;Didn’t work for me;This didn’t work for me but may for others. It wouldn’t stay plugged if my phone case was on which is annoying. Then I had it plugged in under my desk with my phone on top of the desk and the magnet wasn’t strong enough to keep it from coming detached. I ultimately returned the item as it seemed to be more of a hassle than anticipated.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Must have for any tech household!;Where have these been all my tech life?  My kids & husband break lightening (iPhone) charges constantly!  Heard about these via a TikTok & had to buy.  Great price for how many you get.  We use them to charge iPhones, iPads, kindles, & other micro usb products.  No more worrying about the cord breaking at the plug portion! The cord port glows a bright blue when it has power to it, so you might not want it in a bedroom at night.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Weak magnet;It's a great idea. Magnet is just not strong enough to stay connected
4.0 out of 5 stars;Wher have these been all my life.;I love these cables. They work very well and make attaching cable so much easier. I have a cell phone stand on my desk and just have to set the phone in the stand and these cables snap right together without any effort at all. they also make good dust covers for the charging port on the phone. I have changed everything I own over to these and actively recommend them to friends all the time.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Don't love it;It seems that much of the power used is lost through heat.  This makes for a slower charge, probably at double the usual charge time.If you plan to use these primarily when you sleep, buy it.  A slow charge is better for your battery, otherwise try to find a more efficient charger.
3.0 out of 5 stars;It's ok but it's a hassle to travel with.;This product is ok it came with chips ∧ different sizes. But the longer cords after a while they got annoying to have. Not all of the charging cables rotate only one& the other just plug directly with out rotating but because their magnetic the detach easily as opposed to the rotating one. The other down side is uneless you carry this exact cable with you you will able to charge your phone.  If not you will have to be taking the magnetic chip out the phone to charge with a regular charger cable.
3.0 out of 5 stars;One broke day 3.;When I received this order, they seemed to charge as well as the more expensive one I bought but the very first one I used, the piece that plugs into the phone's charging port came apart into 2 pieces on day 3. Since I've mostly used the original one I bought while occasionally using these and being very gentle with them, the others haven't fallen apart. Hopefully it was just one defective piece. I will update later if needed. I guess for the price, if only one breaks and they charge well enough, it'll be fair enough.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works as described;Docking a point because the LED light is super bright, unnecessary, and super annoying at night. Had to tape mine up to avoid the piercing light. Other than that, works as described and massive upgrade from having to constantly struggle to get the plug in the port! Also, the 1' cord is pretty useless unless you're just charging your phone next to you from say your laptop. Another 3' or 6' would have been better.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Ok but not that great.;The 1 ft cord for my car is an inch too short to reach my holder. Dang!  The other cord lengths are good. The magnet is not strong. I wouldn’t test hanging my phone from it!  That’s a bummer. It pops off all the time is holding/using while plugged in.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Allows for quick connection;I like the idea of the magnetic connection.  This is the main reason i bought this charger.My dislike is it disconnects easily.  A slight tug and it's disconnected.  I have to be honest to say that my phone protector gets in the way putting pressure on the connection, that doesn't help.Other then that, I love it.
3.0 out of 5 stars;I really want to like this...;I really want to like these chargers.  The concept is brilliant, but the execution leaves a little to be desired.  The connection that stays in the phone is a little large, but I can get past that.  The primary problem is that the Apple adapters do not fit at all.  I cannot even get them into my son's iPhone 11.  I have not tried to force it, because I do not want to ruin the phone, but it should not be this difficult.  The Mircro USB and the USB-C both work fine, but no go on the Apple connection.
3.0 out of 5 stars;No Carplay;It doesn’t support Apple Carplay
3.0 out of 5 stars;Great but with issues;Charging power is great, convenient, and works well.Issues:- the adapters chip after using for a little while, then are no good. Already been through all my apple adapters- Must buy a whole new set just to get new adapters. This is wasteful.- The plugs that are right angled are a good concept, but are terrible. They dont have good balance so easily comes off with just moving phone. I wish their longer cables came with regular straight plug.UPDATE: July 2020Needed more adapters, made sense to just order new set. Unfortunately, all of my IOS devices display (accessory may not be compatible) after about 2-3 minutes and don't charge. So,can't use with IOS....
4.0 out of 5 stars;Brightly lit, but why?;I like the ability to quickly/easily connect disconnect and swap components, the charge rate is the same as with normal cables.  It's really handy in the car to charge the phone without any distraction.I dislike the blue lights at night.  They are Bright in a dark room.  I wish they included more adapters,  I ran short of micro USB adapters (wireless headphones).
4.0 out of 5 stars;Magnetic charging cords must have;Love the magnetic capability but it can move a tad and cause the item not to charge . Love the blue light on the end , makes it easy to find. Also be careful removing the magnetic dock from the charging port of the item so small that they are hard to find if they hit the floor lol
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good;Like it very much
4.0 out of 5 stars;Working fine;I really like the way the magnetic tip clicks to the phone. So far they are working great.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Very convienent but not very durable for the price;All the ports eventually (I've gone through all 4 of the USB C ports since my purchase in may (5 months), which was my second time buying these. I wouldn't really mind if the replacement tips weren't so expensive, $10 for 5.
3.0 out of 5 stars;It's not bad;We are an Android family, so most of our devices use the Type C connector. So, I really bought these for those friends that come over that don't use the Type C connector. I wanted to have something that was useful to us, but friends could use as well. The product itself is durable and works great. The problem I have is that the piece that you plug into your device gets stuck in there. meaning when you are done charging, the magnet on the other piece isn't strong enough to pull the other part out of the charging port of your device. I have fairly small fingers, but it is still hard to grasp the piece to try to get it out.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Failing plug ins and cables;Less than a week after using my iphone plug in stopped working. This is my everyday use phone and plug in.Two months in, one cable wont work anymore. Other is on the way
4.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't work with Android Auto but charges well;Easy to use but you have to take the magnet out of your phone to use with Android Auto so I expect to lose a lot of magnets.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Dirty Magnetic downfall;Absolutely brilliant concept on paper but one fatal flaw, it’s magnetic on both the cable and the adapter. This charger works great with all my devices and with the variety of cable lengths and adapters there’s nothing I can’t charge, but the magnets constantly attract fine metal dust particles.  It’s fairly easy to clean the adapter end however the cable is a completely different story.  The dirt tends to work it’s way into the recessed point and because of the magnet is not easily cleaned out.
3.0 out of 5 stars;The thing you didn't think you needed!;We love these chargers. They are so convenient. In my household, we each have devices which use different charging ports, so being able to have cords in each room which can be used for all of our devices is very convenient. That being said, the ones that we use the most (living room, and bedroom) wear out quickly. We have had to order the set 2 times, because those main ones will only work for 3 months. They then go from being fast-chargers, to actually charging so slowly that they drain the battery power because they keep waking the phone up. If this can be fixed, this product would be perfect.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works as advertised;The cable does what it is supposed to do, however, the magnet is very weak and needs to be re-attached anytime I move the phone.  Outside of that annoyance, the cable works as described.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Charging cables;The magnets don't hold very well. If you sit perfectly still it's okay. Slight movement causes the magnets to let go.
5.0 out of 5 stars;I will buy more!!;These are great if you have kids that seem to break devices charging ports or cords.  Simply insert the magnet in your device port and leave it in.  Never worry about shoving a cord in the slot again.  These come with several device port options and cord lengths.  I have noticed no change in charging speed.  They are just as fast as my regular fast charging cord setup.
3.0 out of 5 stars;THE ATTACHMENTS DIED ONE EVERY MONTH;I bought these chargers in hopes they would last longer than most power cords. I got half my wish. The attachment you plug into your device has to go a certain way. The magnets on the chargers that go straight in aren’t as strong as the magnets on the 90 degree angle charger. (Which is a bit inconvenient cause I use the straight chargers in the car and sometimes they come undone. My problem I’m having is the attachments that go into your phone has quit working only after using them for 3 months. I use one attachment a month. I’m kind of disappointed because I had great hopes for these cords. I paid up for these.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Bright blue light!!!;Aside from the super bright blue light that keeps you awake when you need a dark room, it does a decent job.  The blue light gets so bright that it will keep me awake. I have to cover the phone charger in order for it to not be so bright.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Awesome;They’re light and awesome. Different sizes for every need-spot-& scenario you would need them for. I have the chip parts in all my most commonly used items and it’s just a quick flip to charge all my different devices (phone/vape/bluetooth speaker) it also has a night light blue indicator by the charger which is an awesome touch as well.
4.0 out of 5 stars;"Good option; weak magnets";I like this product, it does what it says it's supposed to and it gave me many many different charging heads. The one thing I really dislike about it is that the magnetic bond is not very strong. I've seen other products where the bond is much stronger.
4.0 out of 5 stars;For Micro-USB (lightning on my iPAD and Iphone) - Dongle on device end. It only works one-way-up!;For Micro-USB (lightning on my iPAD and Iphone) -The dongle on device end. It only works one-way-up! - Found by trial and error. Garbage documentation/FAQ's, at least I didn't find anything that says that.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Good product but seems to have poor QA;I like the product but one of the cables was defective and did not come with the magnet leaving it unusable.
3.0 out of 5 stars;No fast charging;Better than other magnetic chargers that I've used, as far as durability and magnet strength. The cable genuinely can pick up your phone just by the magnet. But, despite the description saying it has fast charging, it doesnt. If anything, its slower than standard. I dont mind a ton cause fast charging isnt a deal breaker for me. But if it is for you, do NOT buy this one. there are other magnetic chargers that, may not be as strong, but will charge must faster. All in all a decent product.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works;Is as pictured. Insert even works with my case on
3.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't always charge;The idea is great, but even when connected it doesn't always charge. I bought 2 sets of these and additional cables for my family of 4 to help with our constant fighting over USB ports. Great idea, but it was unreliable. When it did charge it was fast.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good product, responsible seller.;Received order quickly. One cord did not work. Reported it to seller and received a replacement which did work in just a few days. Pleased with thie quick charging and ease of use. Would recommend these cords. Would definitely buy from this seller again.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good cords, light is annoying.;I like these cords, and they work with another set (same adapters in the phones/devices). I just wish they didn’t glow. I’ve tried to cover them up so the light doesn’t bother me at night.
3.0 out of 5 stars;works ok, charges slow, no data transfer, magnets hold well;Cords are good, but don't provide fast charging. Slow charges, not turtle slow where its useless or that it takes hours on end to charge, maybe half speed or third of speed of normal Samsung charger.Cords are purely for charging no data transmission.The magnets are strong enough to hold my phone upside-down by the cord and it not fall but that is from me holding phone upside-down with cable connected and then letting go to see if it holds.
2.0 out of 5 stars;DEAL BREAKER FOR ME!;This item should clearly say: “TO CHARGE, YOU SHOULD SHUT CELL PHONE OFF!” Or risk a fire. Also, when I left my iPhone on, it didn’t seem to be charging. The iPhone said it was being charged, but after checking several times, no charging. So I shut my iPhone off!  It started charging my iPhone once I shut it off.  So, since you’re suppose to shut of your cell phone, you can’t use your cell phone the entire time it’s charging. DEAL BREAKER FOR ME. There isn’t anything that tells you when your cell phone is fully charged, and because your cell phone if OFF, you can’t check to see if your cell is fully charged. Others complain that the blue light on the end is annoying in your bedroom at night. It would be nice if this light went out when your cell was charged. But I still would not buy this charger cable unless you don’t care if you won’t be able to use your cell while it’s charging.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Inserts in first batch came apart, second batch seems okay;The cables are great, good variety, good length, etc.The problem that takes this from a 5 start to a 3 star is durability. the little inserts in the first batch fell apartSo far we've had the tiny magnetic disc piece crack apart and we've had it simply come off of the insert.Bought a 2nd batch and they're working okay so far...
3.0 out of 5 stars;Annoying that it doesn't charge sometimes and the tips break easily.;The tips of the charger break easily and the phone charges slow sometimes
3.0 out of 5 stars;The concept of this is great but;the samsung and usb-c cords are pretty good but the iphone chargers are a flaw they don’t work on my iphone 12
3.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn’t work for cars;I wish that this cable worked with my car, instead I keep getting an error where it is not recognized as a charging device and won’t connect my phone to car play. This was the main reason for my purchase and a promise of the item
3.0 out of 5 stars;Only good in Theory....;In THEORY these are great and they would be IF NOT FOR  the piece that goes into my IPHONE 11S has the charging strips on JUST ONE SIDE!! Not like a regular IOS cable that fully connects all in one, it has it connecting both sides.  So it goes down in connection  and charge .  If it were on both sides this could be a slam dunk. Unfortunate 😕
3.0 out of 5 stars;maybe get this;overall a good product, but not great or amazing. it does have a great magnet, but doesn't charge like its supposed to. its more like I'll charge your phone as long your not on it, and if only it I'll keep it from dieing. it says it is a fast charge with the original box, but it isn't.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Goodagnet connection, slow charge;Magnet is strong and cord lengths are perfect.The cord is not reliably compatible with other magnetic charging wires.Charging takes twice as long.The wire I bought straight from a Chinese shopping site chargd my phone twice as fast as these.  I cannot recommend.
2.0 out of 5 stars;JUNK;Not strong , charges slow
3.0 out of 5 stars;meh.  work for a little while;I found that the cords all stopped working over a period of months...last one gave out after 18 months.  Also made the USB cube super hot vs. other cables.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Weak magnetic hold.;This is is always letting go while connected to my phone. And it doesn’t charge all device I have that work on a cord and basic block. I am only keeping it because it’s to trouble some to return.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Weak connection;I gave it a 3 star rating because the magnet is not strong enough to maintain the connection with the phone. It constantly falls off and has to be reattached, which is quite annoying and not as advertised. Description of the cords state that a phone can be held upside down and won't fall off but that's not my experience. It charges decently though. I would explore getting a different brand that has a stronger magnet.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Unexpected weakness;This is a great product with functional features like magnetic attachments and indicator light. Very easy to attach/detach without being too loose and nice variety of cords length. The only con is that the inserting unit seems a bit filmsy.The device had a leatherette cover so the inserted piece has not been visibly protruding and there has not been any impact on it. The magnet part broke off after a week of daily usage.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Does not support fast charging;As mentioned, none of these cables supports fast charging, at least on my Samsung Galaxy S10+. From 40% charge, it is estimated to take 2 1/2 hours to full instead of 1 1/2 with fast charging. This is a deal-breaker for me, even though this is one of the only ones with a round tip, allowing me to connect the charger much easier. The magnet is quite strong, at least compared to one of the flat tip models I used. This would be a pretty incredible product if it supported QC, but until then, I'll stick with the flat connectors.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Beware! The pictures are not accurate;Before you purchase these, you should be aware that all four of the cables come with regular USB on one end. You cannot change that end of the cable to any other type of connection. So if you are expecting, as the pictures show, to be able to have a USB-C connection on both ends of the cable, you will be disappointed.  It looks like a great solution if that's what you are looking for.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works great;Cord lengths are great
3.0 out of 5 stars;Needs some modifications;I like the concept of the magnetic charging, easy to connect and disconnect.  The problem I have with it is that sometimes it shows that my phone is charging but phone is not taking a charge.  The other dislike I have is when I charge  in my car using usb,I would also like to be able to use my phone features like my Maps to be displayed on my cars screen.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Easy to use but I feel like the adaptor causes my tablets to drain much faster;I live the easy of the magnetic plug and love the light at the end of the plug.  However, my tablets (2 different kindle fire) both drain battery power much faster when sitting idle ever since I installed the adaptors than they did prior, I have to charge them every 2-3 days even if I don't use them whereas I could go up to 10-14 days on a charge  in the past
4.0 out of 5 stars;Handy, not fast charging;"Very easy to use comes with many of the  pieces that go into your device, doesn't charge as fast as original cord on my phone and one of the ""adapter "" pieces broke within 2 weeks but all in all its handy"
2.0 out of 5 stars;Poor magnetic connector durability;I like the variety of cord length and the blue light at the end of the cord which makes it easy to see. However, after using one of the magnetic connectors in my iPhone fir only two weeks it started to charge only intermittently. I soon learned the connector was falling apart and had to remove it from my phone. I kept the connector always in the phone so it was not due to removing it often.  I can only guess that removing it occasionally would have caused it to fall apart sooner.  Since the connector is the most important aspect of this magnetic charging system I cannot recommend this product.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Cables are to fragile at the part nearest the charging charging magnet;I bough these to protect my charge ports from getting plugged in and out and to standardize the ports and cables on several devices. It’s been great for standardizing the ports and cables. Problem is the charge power is pretty slow. I can live with that though. The real issue is the cable is too fragile. I bought two pack of these and if the 8 cables 4 have gone bad. The tip that connects to phone gets damaged far too easily. You have to keep the cable bent just right for it to work and after some time it will stop working completely.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Just charging capabilities;This is just for charging. It will not transfer data between phone and vehicle. Android auto or car play
3.0 out of 5 stars;These are great when they work;The adapter is tiny and easy to leave on the devices, the cords are slick, it is easy to attach and detach, the only issue I've had is that sometimes they don't attach enough and sometimes they don't charge. Switching to a different cord tends to fix it, so I think it is a problem with the cords (dirt, quality, design?).
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not Getting Fast Charge;I have used this cord on a Galaxy S9+, using an Anker portable charger, and a wall wart advertised to do 2.4a@5v.  Accubattery app says this device is getting 1a@4v.  That's 4 watts.  This is advertised to do 2.4a@5v (12 watts).  So I'm getting 1/3 of the power, and cannot explain it.  Either this is faulty, or 2 of my charging devices are faulty, or the app reporting the same charging #'s from both of my charging devices is faulty.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Best one out there;I'm a trucker and I been buying all kinds of charger, I use charger in and out 24/7 and charger gets worn out after 2 weeks or more of use. It's probably of the stabbing part when charging, pulling here and there 24/7. So, this one right here is the best one out there, the soft material of the wire that prevent it from worn out, plus you only use one hand to charge your phone while driving. No need two hand stab charging your phone is ridiculous. I love this product
3.0 out of 5 stars;Obnoxiously bright and unnecessary LED!;This would be a great item instead of just good if they got rid of the obnoxiously bright blue LED. It is annoying and unnecessary. Three stars overall due to the bright LED and a slight durability issue with the lightning connectors wearing out. This is weird because it never gets taken out yet somehow wears out.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Cool, but...;Pretty neat gadget.  The blue light is way too bright and I have to cover it with a shirt or something else while I'm trying to sleep.  Also, very difficult to use if you have a phone case.  I had to shave the opening of my case in order to get this thing in and out.  Also fairly difficult to pull the little tips out of your phone at all.  But, they do charge your phone albeit slowly, and they're pretty neat.
1.0 out of 5 stars;weak,poor, slow charging;"when using this magnetic charger my phone give me a notification - ""Device charging slowly""."
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not long lasting;I really like these charging cables. It is really nice to be able to use the same cable across all our devices. However, within a few weeks two of the cables will not charge more than a trickle. It was taking upwards of 10 hours to charge a phone from 15% power.  My husband switched back to his usual charging cables, and I am hoping what I have will last. If two of the cables hadn't died on us so quickly I would be happy with my purchase.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice patent;The LED light cannot be turned OFF at night when you want to sleep.The 6 ft cable as angleg plug wich is not usefull. Instead, the 3 ft with stright plug will be perfect.(It has no power souece, its just cables.)
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not as advertised;I read the reviews and description of these cables and they said it charged iPhones and iPads quickly. I also found an article that listed the top ten magnetic cords. This was rated #1. Very disappointed in this product. It takes forever to charge my iPad and it's only a little quicker charging my iPhone. I would have returned them but I was out of town and couldn't. Now I'm stuck with two sets.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Like the manor the lights.;Love the magnets it really makes charging easy.  I did take away one star due to the added light.  It way to bright at night.  It's like having a flashlight on all the time.  No so good in a dark bedroom.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Does not perform as stated  Waste of money.;Charges older I phone but not mini iPad 4 or 5.  Error statement given that the unit does not support this device.  The battery lights up when cord attached to magnetic.  Also have rotated tabs in units with the thought that tabs were damaged or bad.  Still did not charge with I pads. Tabs placed in charging ports are easily removed when separating tab from cord.  Mini iPads still require traditional cords.  My grandson has similar magnets and cords from another manufacture and they work on his I pad.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Takes hours to charge;These are good quality. Lots of different lengths of cords. Takes forever to charge your phone.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good idea - takes some effort in practice;Work as intended, plenty of extra tips.  Note the lightning tip is one sided (directional).  Small tips to keep track of.  Best as an all in solution.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Buy something else;It's cheap for a reason. It charges VERY slowly. The magnetic head is very weak - pull off with no effect from connection. There are much better choice out there .
3.0 out of 5 stars;Poor durability. Dont buy;This is a good charging cable... If it was more durable. The part that clicks into your phone broke within 2 weeks of having it. Thankfully i was able to get it iut of my phone to use another charge cable I have. I would not recommend this to anyone. Great idea. Poor durability. And I have had a similar type for about 6 months. Different brand. Still running strong. I had only bought this for the fact that it had a side cable
3.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't have a Strong Magnet. Slightest touch and they fall off.;Not a very strong Magnetic to stay on my phone. Just a slitest touch and they fall off my phone. I do like the fact that now if I'm in a bind I can have these instead of having to pull out the adapter from my phone to charge the Old Fashioned Way and possibly loose the little adapter.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Maybe I just got a bad set of cables, but 3 cables DON'T work.;Seems like a great concept, but not good on application. I know it works, because the longest cable work, AND it WORKS GREAT! Unfortunately, two of the cables didn't work AT ALL (never worked), and one cable worked, but shorted out and doesn't keep a good connection on the USB plug side. I'm willing to concede that maybe these were all just manufactured in a rush or something, and I'm willing to be proven wrong, but this first see I ordered is just not up to par.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charge;This will probably work fine for charging like wireless keyboard and mouse, but for full time phone or tablet charging it is awful. Using the standard 15W charger my phone comes with, it takes twice as long to charge if the connection is good, but half the time it doesn't charge properly will say like 10 hour to charge, even not in use. Very finnicky, it is cheap for a reason.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Low quality;The quality of these cords are very low. I got a 4 pack and they all had problems with charging right away.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not long lasting;I loved this product when I first got it.  Charges quickly.  Easy to use.  However.....the product does not seem to be long lasting.  I can no longer get a consistent charge out of it.  I've swapped tips multiple times.  Cleaned them.  Cleaned the charging port.  Swapped out the charging cable.  Just won't give a consistent charge now.  I have to wiggle it around to get it to start.  And sometimes it will just stop charging during the night.  Regular charging cables still work fine, so I can only assume it is the product, not my phone that is having issues.  Overall, very dissatisfied with the product.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Weak charging, not worth it.;These cables slow-charged my Samsung Galaxy S9+. I like that you get multiple lengths of cable in the same package and I've only had one piece break so far. The magnets aren't very strong, so don't expect to be able to plug your phone into a portable charger and throw the whole thing into your backpack. The tips light up blue when plugged in which makes them easy to find in the dark but the light is almost too bright and can be disturbing in a bedroom if you need a dark space to sleep in. Overall, they're just okay and I'm sure you can find a better choice but if you're stuck at this price point and aren't buying them to charge something you need charged quickly, they're fine.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Magnet is a little weak;These are okay. I wish the magnet was a little stronger like in the video, But other that I am pretty happy with them.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works great except  ...;All is great but for my phone, it doesn't work as well because of my phone case, the cord doesn't reach and it's not really easy to take the phone case on and off every time. It does work perfectly with everything else though
3.0 out of 5 stars;Easy-to-use;Like the over all variety of lengths. Easy to use.  However, this is our second purchase.  First set the party that stays in the phone had the magnet break off. And 3-4 weeks after using  the cord melted.  The smell of burning plast
5.0 out of 5 stars;This answers what plug am I looking for;I have the cords plugged in everywhere and  the appropriate end in the devices so when I sit down any device can be changed
4.0 out of 5 stars;Hot cars;They work good just don't leave in your car when it's hot outside the plastic on the end that hooks to the phone will melt
4.0 out of 5 stars;Cost;Like the difference length of cords.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great;Great product
3.0 out of 5 stars;NO Quick-/Turbo-Charging !!;The cables work as promised -- they did NOT promise compatibility with QC 2.0 or QC 3.0 !!The concept of magnetically attaching the cable is very convenient as you just snap-on the cable  e.g. in-car charging.Since I have GoPro cameras and GPS devices that need charging while driving, a MINI-USB adapter would be useful addition to the set.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Innovative, but lacking power and Capability’s;I noticed this cable does not work with cars if you have Apple CarPlay. I have nit tested yet but I am assuming it wont work with data transfers either since CarPlay can’t be pulled up when plugged in. I also do not know if it charges slower than regular cables but felt that way to me. Durability’s wise I have no idea yet as I just revived mine today!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Light wayyyyy too bright;Great product, but the light is super annoying at night. Blindingly bright. Had to put duct tape around mine and the light still shines through.
4.0 out of 5 stars;must buy;i love magnetic charging cords. love them
3.0 out of 5 stars;Great idea, needs improvement;These take a long time charging your devices, even if using a fast charging adapter. After a couple weeks of usage, my cell and my daughter's tablet needed to be blown on to charge. I do love the ease of the magnetic charger and how nothing gets damaged. I just wish it worked better.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Charging magnet.;The magnet is not very strong and it says weak charging. It is hard to pull the magnet piece out once it is plugged into the device.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Easy to use, slow charge.;Cables charge slowly no matter what charging brick you are using.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Easy to use,  but slow charging;The cable is convenient and easy,  doesn't deliver a speedy charge. Love the idea,  but a bit disappointed in performance.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Could be better;A couple of the tips don't seem to work.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Beware;I was loving these charging cords for me and my child until she brought me her cord and the light just flickered. I havent even had these for a month. I thought these would last a bit longer. Durability kind of STINKS!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Cord length;Loved having different cord lengths  for different needs.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Prolong the life of failing USB ports and more!;Really helped to prolong the life of several of my devices with failing USB ports. I also use them on my other phones due to the convenience.
4.0 out of 5 stars;For the money it was a good purchase.;This item comes with a lot for your money. I however have had it a couple of weeks and have noticed that it’s not charging or connecting the way it did the first few days that I charged with it.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Fast charging does not work!;"The charger is very useful when I switch between various electric products.Because the head is made of magnet, only wire can be changed and they have 4 type cord length.But... the biggest disadvantage of the product is that high speed charging is ""not"" possible."
3.0 out of 5 stars;Annoying light;I cannot say anything about the quality it's really good that's what it says but the only negative and it's quite big negative is the big blue light I didn't realize how annoying it was
2.0 out of 5 stars;Magnetic terminals get dirty and loose their plateing afer 4 months of use...;Overall good product, however the plating (unknown type used) wears off over time and looses connection at the magnetic end thus defeating the purpose of the item. Other than that these are fairly just ok...
5.0 out of 5 stars;Easy to charge.;Easy to use. At first I almost sent them back because I thought it didn’t work but realized I had put the magnet in my phone wrong. Turned them around and that did the trick. Now they’re working properly. I love them.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good product with persistent problem;Good product but every type C plug has cracked
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not for data.;Works great for charging. I purchased these to go from my house to my truck. It does not do data. I cannot sync my GPS or pandora to my truck. If you want these for data transfer look elsewhere. For charging, no issues. Unfortunately, I wanted both. I will have to keep looking.
3.0 out of 5 stars;SLOW charging;It works perfectly, just much slower than with the same charger and a normal cable.I think the ideal product would be a charger with magnetic tip cord attached.  This way you could provide enough electricity to overcome the loss I'm assuming that is happening in the magnets.I would recommend this product only for those who are looking for an overnight charging solution.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Cool;Pretty cool but does not charge fast enough.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Lightning plugs defective or low quality;Sadly I have to report that the wonderful addition of magnetic connections to our iOS devices has been marred by the poor quality of the lightning “bars” attachment. One of the benefits of the lightning plug is that there is no wrong way of inserting them into our iOS devices. That is not the case with these devices and as a matter of fact one of the “bars” was easily scrapped off. To add to my dismay and despite being properly placed frequently there was a considerable amount of heat generated. Most disconcerting.
4.0 out of 5 stars;not a strong magnet;Serve their purpose. It's nice not having to find a different cord for each phone. The wish magnet was stronger. They disconnect way too easily. Also be careful of dropping your phone, the piece in your phone breaks really easily.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Don’t waste your money, Worked well until it broke;*Updated Review* This product is garbage, every since plug adapter has stopped working.  Lightning, USB-C, and micro-USB all died within a month of daily use.  Only up side is the cables seem durable, but without the plug adapters they are worthless. Product suddenly stopped charging one day after a month of daily driving this charger.  Then when i removed the adapter from my phone i found that the plug had separated from the magnetic base.  I was lucky it didn’t completely separate inside the port.The durability of this product is poor, which is why i only gave it a 1 star.  I’ve had my iphone for a year and still have the original lightning cable.  This product lasted a month.The charger charged the phone just fine, the various cord lengths are fine, and the magnet is strong.  I’m still using this on my usb-c devices just fine, but the lightning adapter is poor quality.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Sometimes works...Sometimes not;Disclaimer-I knew this cable wouldn't support fast charging (didn't get for that reason)-Some devices recognized the cable being plugged in, while others didn't-Charging times very poor (not fast charging times, just normal charging)-Most powered devices (not even demanding ones) didn't power on/workOn the box is even a warning to use ORIGINAL/CERTIFIED chargers/accessories (if our cable doesn't work or damages your devices...we warned you)Don't buy these
4.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charge;Not fast charge. Wish had the type c adapter for the new iPhone 11 charging box.
4.0 out of 5 stars;The pronunciation;Mirco type keeps falling out when you pull on the charger to go but the others stays in i could not try it on my iphone because of its case but over all the product is very good and im planning on buying more
2.0 out of 5 stars;Broke within one week of ise;I liked the product so much in the beginning that I ordered another one few days ago.  But the charging plug that goes into the phone broke into 2 pieces and is unusable.  I plan to return but I just missed time window for returning it.I hope the seller will send me the replacement soon.I will update sellers response later.
3.0 out of 5 stars;It's ok, but not for smartphone;It's ok, but not for smartphone
1.0 out of 5 stars;Chargers;Not what I hoped for.
3.0 out of 5 stars;No fast charging;The idea is great, but the lack of fast charging is a disappointment. If you're using your phone while charging you'll be lucky to maintain your battery level.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Ok;Giving it a 3 just because it seems convenient at first but overall takes for ever to charge. If your looking for a fast charger this isn't it. However, it seems the shorter the cable the faster the charge. Still ok though.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Only slow charging;"Based on the mixed reviews I was hoping these would at least charge my Pixel 3 at a normal speed. The Pixel 3 has three charging states, ""Charging Slowly"", ""Charging"", and ""Fast Charging"". These will only charge slowly, regardless of what charger is used. I did not expect them to fast charge, as most magnetic cables won't, but I though they would do better.Magnets seem strong... Cables seem very thin and cheap construction compared to other magnetic cables."
3.0 out of 5 stars;No good;Three of my cords gave out had to buy new magnetic plugs still didn’t work cords are not with the money didn’t even last a month
3.0 out of 5 stars;Just okey;When I received the chargers some of the charging ends that go into the phone were  broke. Cord lengths are good.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn’t work with Apple CarPlay;Not sure I’m going to keep them, they don’t work with Apple CarPlay, the whole reason I got these is to use in the car
2.0 out of 5 stars;Cheap connections;The magnets are weak and do not create good charging connections...  especially when trying to use the phone while charging...Almost useless unless you plan on charging your phone and letting it sit.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Poor quality strength magnets;Magnets aren't very strong. Not only it doesn't take much to break the physical connection, but slight tampering breaks charging process also.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good but No Andriod Auto;I really do like it. It even fits on my Samsung s9 with the otter box on but it does not allow Android Auto in my 2020 GMC Sierra.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Did not work to connect my iPhone to the car;I bought this pack because I was wondering connect my iPhone to the car, but it did not work with my car radio.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good so far..;I have had this product for a week.  So far so good.  Love that i don't have to look down while driving to plug in the phone.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Super convenient!;You get a good variety of USB tips of varying sizes, just plug one into each of your devices. Setup your magnetic cables around the house, then charging is a piece of cake. No more having to plug in a cable, just get the magnetic cable near the magnet tip, they hook up and you're charging!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Highly recommend;Been trying to get everyone on these. I got the deluxe pack and just plugged one of the bits into everything I own and now I only need one charger to charge everything. It's also nice being able to just snap on/away from the cable and not worry about yanking it out of the wall if you trip on it. Great buy
5.0 out of 5 stars;Magnetic is the way to go.;I've had these a few weeks now and compared to regular charging cables these things are great. With regular cords the part that you put in your phone (or whatever you are charging) gets wore out and damaged from the constant insertion and removal and after a while you have to hold your phone a certain way for it to charge.  These magnetic cords prevent all of that mess.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Deacent;Good length and durability always either charged slower or regulatnwouldnt fast charge my galaxy s9 even with a fast charging adapter.
4.0 out of 5 stars;So far so good;Only thing to make sure you notice up front, 4 cables, 3 sets of connectors for it!  Works great and made life easier for my wife on her electronic devices, no fumbling to get the cable end into the device
3.0 out of 5 stars;Does not work with Apple CarPlay or any data transfer.;DOES NOT WORK WITH APPLE CARPLAY OR ANY DATA TRANSFER.Apologies for the all capitals, I didn’t see this information listed anywhere and by the time that I got the product, I learned the hard way. Do not buy this product if your intention is to use it for any sort of data transfer or Apple CarPlay. If your intention is to just have a charging cord, it works great.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Works great while they last;Cables and connectors work perfectly (for a day or two).  Cords are very cheap and will quickly become unusable.
1.0 out of 5 stars;onyl two worked on arrival and after a week only one worked;when it worked for one day it was cool but only two of them worked the really short one and one of the long ones but after a week the long one fell apart and doesn't work now i only have the really short one it works fine but not worth the money
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not good quality;Very thin and not quick charge competible. Does have light at the end but stop working the next day so i use another not happy with performance
3.0 out of 5 stars;Buy something else;Slow charging, lost magnetic power comes off easy bought mainline to replace these
2.0 out of 5 stars;Worked with and iPad for about 1 minute. And not with an iPhone;It works great with USB-C and USB-mini. It does not fast charge, but that’s not an issue for me.What is an issue is that is does NOT work with Apple products. Not my iPad nor any iPhone (11/12).
2.0 out of 5 stars;BEWARE: This charger will damage your iPhone battery;While this is a convenient product... don’t be fooled! This charger has damaged my iPhone 11 Pro battery. It doesn’t charge as quick as the factory iPhone cable and gets very hot while charging. My phone is very new but ever since buying and using this cable... I’ve noticed my battery suffering. It does much quicker and I think it’s due to the heat. I know iPhone batteries start to degrade over time but it usually takes at least 2 years before a noticeable difference is observed. In this case it was less than a year
2.0 out of 5 stars;No fast charging.. gane over;This product is the weirdest thing ever...The good:- provides 4 cables with diff. Lengths (and one horizontal tip for bed charging)- ergonomically amazin- kevlar ish cables- 4 of every usb type....U ask yourself why u gave it bad review ???The cons:- DOESNT PROVIDE FAST CHARGING WITH ANDROID PHONES .. at this day and age dont even think of making a product that doesn't provide fast charging!!( i have note 9 and i used my original plug with it)- the blue annoying light the penetrates all matter of darkness... cant sleep man!!! It lights up the whole block- also: it takes the chargin port (not permanently but u wanna keep it there) .. so good luck if you have no 3.5 Jack port
3.0 out of 5 stars;Very cool but not super durable!;I *love* these and use them on all my devices, but the magnetic part on my phone broke after only 2 months 😩😢 it's a tragedy!!!I wish there was an option to buy more cords without the lights on them too.. I don't like bright lights in the bedroom at night. (Or maybe I should just move my phone to another room for charging!)
3.0 out of 5 stars;Obnoxious blue light;I’d give these 5 stars, but the blue light at the connecting tip is so bright and obnoxious. I can’t use it next to my bed because it’s so bright. Otherwise, the connect and charge fine.  But if you charge your phone next to your bed, I would not recommend these.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Very convenient;Quick connect and easy to keep devices topped off. I like these things.
3.0 out of 5 stars;good, room for improvement.;The center pin is a little recessed just a bit... but not enough.  I had one of USB sticks stick to the magnetic end, and shorted out the whole usb hub.  The cables seem nice, and work well.  I like the way the little ends fit in my pixel, iphone, and several bluetooth devices.
4.0 out of 5 stars;works great;Very cool. Magnets are strong. Seems to charge a little slow. Would buy again.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not durable;The easy use is fantastic, but the durability, the middle pin show a damage so fast… and become useless. This happened in two different connectors
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not a fan;Returned these do not charge any of our devices.. iPhone, iPad, Android, Ring batteries etc..
3.0 out of 5 stars;Waiting for a good charge;Thought these were lightning charger,  takes too long to charge.  Too many inserts to decide which one is for my phone.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Delicate;The first connector I connected fell apart.  Not sure what this speaks of the duribility of the charger.,
2.0 out of 5 stars;Charges very slowly.;These charge so slowly that when I try to use my phone or tablet while it's being charged that the charge actually decreases. It decreases slower than if it's not being charged but not by much. Takes almost all night to charge. The magnet is good and stays pretty well.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Work GREAT!;These work great!  My only worry is that if I left it in my iPhone and I accidentally dropped my phone, it would cause a week spot if it hit the little device.  The variety of cord lengths is so nice to have.  I would recommend.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Junk.  Avoid;A good idea that is poorly implemented.  Magnets are not strong enough to accurately center the cable and results in poor charge rates.  Plugs fit loosely into devices and are prone to fall out.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Happy customer;Extremely happy with this product
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good grip.;The magnets are strong enough to insure a solid connection  for charging.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Customer service is great and they stand behind their product.;Works good and they stand behind their products.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not 360 charging like the original waste of money;Its supposed to be 360. Cord and it just sticks straight on everytime i move it there go it clicking off just awful now i gotta go buy the right one
2.0 out of 5 stars;Good charging cable, but not impressed;I thought the magnet would be stronger. I'm constantly having to reach from the bed to the floor to reconnect it when I make any movement. Not much fun. In the car, the same thing. I'm constantly having to reconnect it, because the cable gets hung on gear shift or the e brake. It pulls apart too easily. I like the idea, but it's more of a pain than it's worth.I like the light on the end of the cable. It helps me find the cable when it constantly disconnects. The magnet is decent, it's just not strong enough to make this idea useful. My girlfriend has complained about the light being too bright, and I agree that it could be toned down a little. But the light is the least of my complaint.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Phone piece broke in less than 24 hours of use;Well I would like to say that I love it but when my phone got knocked off of a folding chair (about 17in off the floor) it broke the piece that goes in my phone. Oh and I just started using it last night!  Luckily it comes with more connections but if they all break this easy my review will go down!
2.0 out of 5 stars;They work but they get hot!;I like that I don't have to unplug anything it's just tap and go, but the magnets aren't very strong so just a light tug and you aren't charging anymore, and the pieces get very hot.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Waste of money;Leaving the adapter inside of devices damaged them.Does not carry data.Easily picks up metal bits that are impossible to remove.Very low gauge wire.Charges very slow, disconnects at the slightest motion.I went back to using my standard charging cables-- wasted my money on these.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Only worked one day, great company to work with!;Worked for a day, then stopped working.Company offered replacement or refund. Very easy company to work with!!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Innovative if worked as described. However it just keeps battery at the % as when it was at plug in;It's a really innovative idea and would be extremely convenient if it worked as described.  Mine could possibly be defective but not likely due to the various parts included and different combinations that all worked subpar. I have a Samsung Galaxy 9plus, and an ipad. It came with correct attachments for both, as well as 3 different cables to attach magically.  In every instance when I tried charging the devices,  they would stay at the same battery percentage they were at when I plugged them in. The battery wouldn't go any lower but it also didnt charge it at all. I could leave them plugged in for hours and it would be at the same percentage as when I started. Just initiated the refund process.  Will update with any further information regarding the situation.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Ehh;The charger cords are okay, they were fine but the charging power took forever to charge my phone
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not too bad.;Not too bad. The wire itself is pretty flimsy so I'm concerned it will eventually get a short in it or something. The magnetic to attach seems pretty good. The charging is realitivly slow since I'm used to a fast charging cable. But it's not too bad.
2.0 out of 5 stars;So Disappointed;I bought big into this system (three compatible sets) and am so disappointed... every 90-degree cable (the most important ones for my applications) has failed.  The gold pins have fallen out and/or have been pushed in, and/or the white bits of insulative plastic have fallen out. I'm so angry that I'm now faced with having to buy big into some other system. - - I have not have any trouble with the straight/standard cables.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good product;In my opinion this charger cord is quality built  but the light is to bright for me but 👍 overall good product
3.0 out of 5 stars;Wouldn't consistently charge;I used it on an iPad and it wouldn't consistently charge. I'd plug it in and it'd work. The next day I'd plug it in the same way and the iPad didn't register it and so it wouldn't charge. It's easy to use though when it does work.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not bad for the money;I love the concept. After a short time it stopped charging when I looked closely the magnets began to Shirov and gather around the connection. Once I clean those off it did start charging again. That has happened several times so far
4.0 out of 5 stars;great deal;These are used on all my devices. They hold up well and are versatile in the size cords you receive.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Seems okay;I’ve had to switch the Apple connectors a couple of times because it wouldn’t  always charge.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Pretty great. Very happy.;I just got it today. I’m surprised about the quality of the chargers. The magnets are pretty strong. I love they they give you different types of chargers. I can charge my phone, kindle, and switch with the same cord. 👏🏻Pretty cool. I’d Theres anything I’d like changed it be that all the magnets were on the side instead of just the one.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Very slow to charge;Slow charging.
3.0 out of 5 stars;great Idea But it won't last;At first is good. 2 weeks later, its starting slow charge. I thought my fone has problem but not. My wife and my co-worker have same problem. Magnetic is so so not strong as advertised. Overall, great Idea and design. But it won't last long.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Well made, effective charging cable.;The magnet on these cables is strong enough to provide a secure connection to power. Works very well  very convenient.
2.0 out of 5 stars;2 strikes, you’re out!;While I love the magnetic feature, the durability is crap! I have purchased two sets of these charging cables. I will not buy a third. They just do not last. The whole point of the magnetic feature is that it allows do user to put less strain On the cable by plugging and unplugging it. The Fact that these cables don’t last as long as a standard cable is ridiculous.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Calidad mala;No me gusto mucho se rompe muy fácil, turnê mal contacto no recomendo
4.0 out of 5 stars;Not all that;The charging outlet power is very weak. Will not fast charge regardless of the brick you use.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Don't purchase for Apple products;Both Apple (i-product) tips stopped working. Other tips (Micro-USB & Type-C) okay for now, but hardly a space-saver if you need to have additional cables for Apple products.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Great deal but the long cables not worth it;After a week both longer cables stop charging the devices correctly. Stick with just the 3ft cables and it fine
2.0 out of 5 stars;Improvements are required;The braided cord and magnetic top was fine. My issue were the device inserts. I have protective cases for my phone and pad. The insert was not long enough to make either good or continual contact to charge the device. It was so tight, when I attempted to remove the insert, it came apart in pieces, with the insert stuck in the port. I needed tools to extract the inserts.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Greaf product!;Great product. Love not having to insert plug everytime to charge. Magnet works great and cord lengths are perfect for my use un office car and bedroom. This is my 2 set just because I have everyone at home using these chargers now.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Combo;No use for 1 foot cable. But I have 3 devices here and now only 1 3 ft cable to charge all...much less mess...thanks
2.0 out of 5 stars;Great concept but won’t stay connected.;I’ve had this product for over a month now and initially I loved it. Now after using it, I’ve realized that it has not lived up to my expectations. The cords are great. The charging connectors go in with little issue. The only problem I’ve found is the magnet on the charging cable is just not strong enough. I’ve woken up numerous mornings with the cord connected but not charging because it’s off the plug. It may not be the magnet necessarily but it is very inconvenient. It’s a great product, just realize that that the charger may be finicky.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Look out for the nib.;It works great. But there is a little nib that sticks out and is annoying.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Magnet not strong enough, slow charging;I had another magnetic charger that I really liked but lost the tips for so I bought these as a replacement. The magnet is so weak that it constantly unplugs, almost rendering it useless. When it is plugged in it charges very slowly.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn’t charge smartphones too fast really good idea.;Good idea just doesn’t charge smart phone fast.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Lights are too bright;Lights are just too bright for bedtime use would really like a light free version. Besides that a really good charger pretty cool aswell
2.0 out of 5 stars;Low quality, slow charge, light too damn bright;I really loved these for the first day... Now I have to hide my phone at night because the charger is so annoyingly bright.  2 of 4 cables are already non functional, for no apparent reason less than 2 months after purchasing. I'm writing this review while shopping for replacement options. Don't buy these.
1.0 out of 5 stars;FRIED CAR BATTERY AND TABLET;FRIED MY CAR BATTERY AND TABLET. Tablet is only 5mo old and it's been completely fried out. Poor wire packaging.This one $20 chord just cost me $400. I can't possibly express how disappointed (ANGRY) I am!
3.0 out of 5 stars;It charges the phone and keeps the port clean. Some functions do not work.;The product did what it claimed to. I have a Samsung Note9 and I like knowing that my charging port is done being abused by constant unplugging and plugging as well as staying debris free. The only downside to the product is that Android auto and fast charging will not function with this product.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great useful item (without real fast charging);Great but doesn't provide fast charging for my Galaxy S8+
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good by;Good cable’s  great price.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Doubles as night lights;Great for charging, but is it necessary for the LED lights to be so bright? They double as night lights, not necessary
2.0 out of 5 stars;Heads do not swivel, as adveritised;"The product detail section is a little misleading. The first bullet point highlights ""360° Rotation,"" but unlike many other magnetic charging cables on Amazon, the heads do not swivel into an L-shape. The 360° rotation is purely to spin around the bit that goes into your phone's charging port, which is completely useless and does nothing for ergonomics, lmao.Additionally, these are not fast charging cords, which is pretty disappointing to me."
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not very durable;In concept these are great. I love how you can easily plug your phone in to charge. That being said, the piece that goes into your phone does not hold up very well. We received two for iPhones and they have both broken.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Convenient connect BUT Super Slow charging;Convenient for making a fast sure connection. But charging speed is slowed considerably even with an 18 watt charger. Ok for trickle charge at night when you sleep.  Otherwise it is too slow for charging.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Supposed to be fast charger;Phone is @54% and it says 3 hours and 11 minutes. Fast? Really???
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect,Easy, Simple. Must have!;Love it will buy more. It could use more charging power! Its simple to plug into when on the road and blue light is not too bright! Great item for all you devices.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Junk;when these arrived, i immediately opened them up and plugged my phone in.  The charging time went from 1 hour to 7 hours, what??  Sent them back.  Tired of these third party vendors sending broken or cheap items.  Time to go back to the stores again.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Adapters pop out easily;It’s all in the title. Nice idea though.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Simple, convenient;Sadly only got 2 package of magnetic connectors for phone when states 4 but definitely like it and very simple to use and convenient
1.0 out of 5 stars;Junk;The magnets are not strong at all
2.0 out of 5 stars;Convenient but useless;These are convenient and plenty of tips were provided.  None of this matters,  however,  because when plugged into my fast charger block my phone wasn't getting enough energy to even maintain the power level.  Returned same day.
3.0 out of 5 stars;slow charging;These cables will not fast charge my Galaxy S20 Ultra. I don't care about the lack of data transfer ability, but the charve rate is not acceptable. At 95%, it shouldn't take 23 minutes to fully charge.
4.0 out of 5 stars;No 1ft cable;Came with 2 6ft, a 3ft, and a 6 INCH cable. No 1ft cable
3.0 out of 5 stars;Worked on husband's phone...but;I wanted to really like this but it only worked for my husband's phone and not my phone or tablet. The part for the micro usb kept coming out of my tablet and my phone never seemed to charge very well. But they worked for his phone and he really likes it.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Magnetic attachment makes charging easy!;Charging with the magnetic attachment solved the problem with our New Galaxy A51 which doesn't recognize wireless charging and the plug saves wear and tear from constantly inserting the charging plug. It solved our problem while not penalizing speed or efficiency.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Bad durability;These things work well for the first few months then the problems start. The little piece you insert into the charging port stopped working. So I put in another one and it stopped working withun a couple weeks. Then the charging cables started coming apart at the terminal end. Now I cannot charge my phone with any part of this product. They are a great idea but there are durability issues.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Charges well, does not work with Android Auto;While I love the aspect of having the magnetic charging, I am unable to use this in my car to connect to Android Auto.
5.0 out of 5 stars;great product;this is the most useful charging cable I've ever used.  as close to a non-contact charging system as can be.  I bought a 2nd set so I could have the convenience in all locations.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Missing pieces;Product works bud did not come with iPhone chargers.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Makes charging a breeze !;Makes charging very convenient ! Does not charge the fastest but if time is not an issue this is a great product.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not Fast Charging;These cables are terrible..Not Fast Charging..My Advice -- Better off looking for other cables elsewhere..
3.0 out of 5 stars;Ok;Ok. But doesn'tt work well for my needs.
2.0 out of 5 stars;"""Device charging slowly""...";"Pros:Good variety of cord lengths and connectors. Very versatile and can accommodate different types of devices to use the same charger.Cons:As shown in the picture, charging speed is not optimal and at some times even worse... I don't know yet why it sometimes showing this message and sometimes doesn't, but clearly there is room for improvement.Conclusion:Not happy even though the ""pros"" are great. At the end of the day you want a reliable charger that treats your phone battery right and I don't trust this to be the case with this one."
2.0 out of 5 stars;This is a perfect way to lose your charging plug.;The magnet is too strong for the plug to separate from the magnet without pulling out of the socket. You'll be in a hurry and forget to pull the plug out from your port and leave it in the car or the train, and it's just aggravating. It needs a bit more engineering before it's a good product.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Good price but still not worth it;These chargers seem great but take 3x as long to charge.
2.0 out of 5 stars;I do dot recommend this;I’ve had this for almost 2 weeks. Stops charging after 30mins. Had it on a 5 port usb bank and shorted 2 of them. I had one on a 2 USB port and did the same thing. Seems to have overloaded the ports or something. At first I would unplug and plug back in in order for it to work but eventually when I would come back to it, it wouldn’t be charging
4.0 out of 5 stars;Awesome product;We love these so far!!  Much easier than plugging into a charger all the time.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Don't get them if you need data transfer for any reason;No data transfer ability. It's just a charging cable so if you have wired car play or similar you have to remove the little part that goes into the phone every time you want to plug in, to the car. Totally defeats the purpose for me. I might return them.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn’t work with certain phone cases;I don’t like that I have to take the case off my phone to use these chargers. Taking my $100 phone case off over and over again and ruining it is not worth it to use this $20 charger
3.0 out of 5 stars;Ok;Hard to keep up with, when you have many that can use them
4.0 out of 5 stars;No fast charge;Seems like good quality just wish it supported fast charging.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Really bright blue light;The LED ends are really bright, too bright for a dark bedroom you sleep in
2.0 out of 5 stars;Don't buy! Not worth the money.;DON'T BUY!Pro: its really easy to connect in low light situations.Con: the constant blue light is very distracting and irritating while you are trying to read or play games. You can only turn it off by unhitching it from the wall.The connection end is very fragile. It broke after only 6 weeks.Not worth the time or money!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Worked great;Worked great for charging, but I wanted to use it in my car for Android Auto. Unfortunately it wasnt transmitting data, only charging.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Weak magnets, cable can't transfer pic files.;Magnets are weaker than expected. Soon as I picked up my phone cable fell off. Unless you pick it up slowly and gently. Can't transfer pics from computer either with cable.  Would not recommend.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Faulty;The cords seem to charge quicker than traditional cords. I purchased the 3 pack and the shortest cord doesn’t work. It’s nice to have the extra adapters.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Breaks some devices, beware.;I only give 2 stars because this did work on 1 of the 2 devices we used it on. This actually broke my phone and it can no longer charge by any cord (it can now only charge on a charging pad). Thankfully I have charging pads and my phone is close to being upgraded anyway. I will not use this on any other device aside from the one it's currently working on. I specifically selected this brand because reviews on other brands mentioned them breaking devices. This brand was clearly not exempt from that issue.
2.0 out of 5 stars;be careful with metal and water;Even though it is a really good idea and very convenient to have magnetic cables, beware that if you let the cable magnetically snap to something metal it will short out. Also if you are around water (rain, bathroom) and you accidentally get water on the magnetic piece of the phone charger, the phone will lock you out from charging your phone as it detects water.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Cool idea, cheap build quality.;Bought two packs of these cause they're an awesome idea, but after about 3 months half of the wires have stopped working. The wires get damaged from just regular wear and tear, near the ends of them where they meet the magnet. I've had four cables stop working so far, and another two are on their way out.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Essential items for often charged devices;Good price, several plug options, good item., These  magnetic cables really save on wear and tear for often recharged items.If you need 'em, these are good ones.
4.0 out of 5 stars;I bought two sets, husband and I .;No need to look. End has a Blue glow , easy peasy connect.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Will not buy again;I’d love that there are different lengths of cords and different magnetic heads, but the magnets don’t stay connected  in very well and is it easy to knock off. The charging is slow.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Do not believe what you see;The magnetic portion of this charger does not work,  It constantly loses connection whenever you pick up your phone or even move it around! When you are trying to text or browse, the charger will constantly loose connection and your phone will keep interrupting by informing that the phone is charging and not charging. For example, you are Charging your phone and you move your phone a little bit and now it's not charging, Very cheap product And the company Should be ashamed for misleading customers
1.0 out of 5 stars;Stay away;Ok guys I’m coming back finding this item and giving you my review. In short summary stay away do not buy. I’ve seen these as an add came back and purchased 2 sets( 1 for my fiancé). For the first month everything worked great charger worked every single time! For the 2 weeks after the first month you would have to unplug the cord and plug it back in for it to resister the device. 2 months later I cannot even get this charger to charge my phone I’ve changed the tips out and nothing I mean literally nothing( once every blue moon I’d get:this device is not supported....) so from my expertise do not purchase. And I also have no other chargers at my house this was it! 2 months later I’m going back to the regular higher end chargers? Hope this helps believe me stay away. The idea is really neat but the magnet is not as near as strong as advertised!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Get it! You won't be sorry.;I like how flexible the cord is and the inserts for each device. No worries about accidentally ripping the cord out of the phone. I absolutely love this. I have been recommending it to everyone.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not very sturdy;These work well for the most part.  However, the magnetic connectors on two of the cables I received came off.  One happened the first time I used the cable.  The other one came off on about the third use.  The other two cables seem to be doing okay.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Durable cable, not fast charging.;Says the cable is fast charging, I've tried all the cables with a multitude of fast charging samsung blocks and not a single one offers fast charging. The cables are wrapped in nylon mesh and seem durable, but if they aren't fast charging they aren't worth using.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Something's Not Right;Plugged the cable with the side mount in to charge a tablet and the device keep draining power until it shut down.  So I investigated, plugged one of the other cables that came with the package in and the tablet started to charge up again.  Then I noticed that the light indicator was not on while plugged in and upon further inspection it appears that the small rubber/vinyl boot on the connection end seems to be missing as you can see in the image I submitted.  Hope to hear from the seller regarding this issue.  The cable is absolutely useless to me at this point.
3.0 out of 5 stars;No data transfer, just charge;No data transfer, just charge
3.0 out of 5 stars;Charges very slow;Only issue I have is speed of charging. I have another brand that charges much faster, not sure why that is
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great cords;Good available lengths to make connections where I needed them. I like the short cord it work great in the car.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Sadly not as good as I hoped;The cords are great but the tips you put in your phone break if you look at them wrong all 4 of the type c that I got broke within a week of using them kinda disappointed in that because had they been more durable I would buy a lot more for coworkers so we could all use the same cable at work
4.0 out of 5 stars;Poor quality;Two of The magnet pieces on the phone already broke within a month. The quality is extremely poor.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Breakdown after 2 months;The charging cord is a good length, but not durable at all.  Has been in daily use and has broken down after 2 months.  The magnetic charging port is coming disconnected from the cord.  The stay in ports have a protruding connection that can recede, and it affects the charging speed and connectivity.  Overall,  can't recommended.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great for most devices;A great product that will change the way you charge.I find the blue led light obnoxiously bright though.
4.0 out of 5 stars;My headline;I just wish magnet was stronger. Gets unconnected kind of easily
1.0 out of 5 stars;FIRE HAZARD. The convenience is not worth the risk.;If the magnetized end comes in contact with a metal surface while the other end is plugged in, it will generate a large amount of heat. Last night I noticed an electrical burning smell, and after a minute of searching I found the source: the magnet end of the cable had attached itself to my pocket knife sitting on the counter nearby. The heat it was generating was enough to melt the plastic on the cable. I grabbed it and yanked it off but burned my fingers in the process. I'm lucky I only burned my fingers, if I hadn't noticed it, it very well could have caught on fire and burned my whole place down.  I immediately threw all my cables away. I strongly urge you to not use these, the danger they pose is not worth the minor convenience they offer.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Best cables I ever bought.;Super smart idea.  So easy to use and I love the glowing ring that makes it easy to find in all light conditions.  Because it is so easy to switch devices I do not as many cords as I used to
4.0 out of 5 stars;The magnets are great;I really like these cables but I wish they would package the tips I bags with like tips.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Seems to work good for fire tablets, but the Apple adapter is cheap;Had an Apple adapter break off in my iPad the first day. It broke flush and was pretty difficult to get out. I’m undecided on whether I like these or not yet.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Seems convenient but it isn't really.;Honestly not that great. It's not compatible with fast chargers and the magnetic thing is more trouble than it's worth, especially if someone asks you to borrow a charger. Also the little plastic bit on the USB end of one is already breaking. Won't buy again.
1.0 out of 5 stars;NO HELP;item was given as a gift and was told by gift recipient that item was not working. I tried all tips on some of my personal items and it indeed did not work. Amazon support wants me to ask gift recipient for item back and return before a replacement can be shipped. Worse support I have experienced from both company and Amazon. NO help at all for gifts.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not great;I like the idea of the magnetic way of charging! However the magnet is not that great. Fell off easily. And the piece has to stay in my phone  and is seriously hard to get out. Wont be using or recommending.
3.0 out of 5 stars;very slow charger;charging is too slow for cell phones if it moves a little
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good but overheats;It was really good but is constantly overheating and going off and on
3.0 out of 5 stars;A cable broke in three days;Don’t like the durability
3.0 out of 5 stars;Could be a little better on the quality;Some port connectors are not working and the magnet is not strong as they show
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good product;Good product! Only flaw is grit attaching to magnet and not providing maximum power.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Nice quality;The magnets are just right in strength. They find their way home easily.The cords seem well made but only time will tell.The magnet end is lit which is a nice feature to find it in the dark.
5.0 out of 5 stars;strong magnet;they hold on to the port well and make it easy to charge many devices off 1 cord
3.0 out of 5 stars;Would've been higher but...;The 6 foot side charging cable worked for about 5 min then died out.  The rest of the cables work great but getting one that dies within 5 minutes of opening the package is pretty disappointing.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Their interchangeable;Liked
3.0 out of 5 stars;Does not charge airpods pro;Otherwise I would give a 5 star review but I use my airpods pro a lot and not being able to use it with a staple item kind of makes these cords a bust for me.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Durable and fast charging.;I've had these for several weeks now. They work great and charge my stuff just as fast as my wireless chargers. Works great in my car as well.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Durability is an issue;I have already had one of the cables fail within a month of receiving these, the connection on the end of one cord failed but so far the other 3 which I use daily are working at the moment
5.0 out of 5 stars;Convenient!;These are so convenient. I can use the same cord for an Android phone and iPad and other things because they have their own magnet. This is amazing for young kids trying to charge phones & tablets.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Very disappointed in this product;This product was great at first and exactly what I was needing.  After a week though they stopped charging fast and hot slower and slower until it wouldn’t charge at all, ( and yes the magnetic plug was inserted with the correct side up). The same thing happened with my husband phone as well so it just wasn’t my phone.  I love the concept of these cords because traditional cords get broken down so easily but to only work for a week!!! I’ll take my chances with the traditional cords and just replace them every 6 months!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Eh;It works with micro usb type c but when u get to iPhone only 2 actually worked with my iPhone but other than that works well and I love it
5.0 out of 5 stars;These are very helpful.;These are great and so helpful when charging. Arthritis in my hands made it very difficult to plug in a conventional cord.The last Apple update 13.3.1 on my XS max has blocked them from charging so I’m looking for a way around apple’s effort to control everything.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Ordered a 2nd set the day after the first set arrived.;I liked these well enough that I immediately ordered a 2nd set.  I use them for my Samsung tablets, phone, laptop.  It only charges which is why i bought them.  The magnetic connection works very well and all of the connectors fit every device as they should.  Highly recommend.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good value;My husband loves it! Only had it for a few weeks but great so far!!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Keeps falling off;Magnetic not strong enough
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great but no data transmission but FAST CHARGING is more important to me;One handed operation. Includes many adaptors, I think 3 of each. Strong magnet. I bought one for my daughter, wife, and myself. Doesn't seem to transfer data.
2.0 out of 5 stars;The design makes in incompatible with most iphones, or androids if you have a case on it.;On the surface it seems great, but the circular design of the lightning insert makes it incomparable on either of my iphones that both have cases on them, or my android phone with a case. The magnet is strong. it works well on some of my products but not phones
1.0 out of 5 stars;RUN don't buy!;Soooo many NOs for this!Won't work on S20 Ultra as you can see in the photo my phone just keeps upping the time for a full charge.I tried it on my kids fire tablets thinking it'd be great for them to stop breaking charging cords but while they are playing their tablets die. It can't even charge fast enough to keep a small tablet on.I connected the charger and it sparked which makes me very scared to use this product with my children.
3.0 out of 5 stars;One-sided iPhone charger;Here’s the good we got a variety of cables to put in here’s the bad the iPhone adapter you can only put in one way or your phone will not charge other than that decent product would recommend
2.0 out of 5 stars;"Doesn't ""fast charge"" even w my original charging block.";This doesn't fast charge.  I tried with different blocks and original phone block....still regular (slow) charging.  Cord lengths are amazing.  Multiple sizes and types of magnetic port plugs but I NEED fast charging.
1.0 out of 5 stars;nice concept, horrible charging capabilities;"Pros: Looks great, I like that the tips light up if you're looking for them in the dark. It's universal and all of them can be used with multiple devices: phone, tablet, earbuds, game controllers.Cons: It will take 1/3 of your day to charge something to 100%. My phone and tablet gave me warnings about the unstability of the charge. When it finally would reach 100%, it wouldn't actually say FULL like it usually does, it would just be almost 100% and ""charge complete in 1 minute"" but never actually get there. Then following the charge, the phone or tablet battery had drained quicker than usual. This really concerns me about the overall battery life on my devices. Yes I get that plugging in & out was the products concern, but now there's more I gotta worry about??I won't be using this."
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great cords!;I loves these cords!  So easy to use, different lengths for different rooms. Exactly what I needed.
2.0 out of 5 stars;You get what you pay for.;I got these so I would stop having to plug and unplug my micro USB charger, and for that it was successful. However, within the first week the right angle 6' cable stopped working, next week it was the other 6' cable. I waant hard on them, they stays neat and tidy, they just failed. In short, you get what you pay for. The 1' and 3' still work, and they even do fine charging at 2.4A.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not recommended for Iphone or android tablet;I love the idea of this charger.Butit doesn’t work half the time.There is no damage to my phone port/ and or tablet port, the gadget that goes in, or the cord.But half the time this doesn’t work.I always carry a spare iPhone cord because this charger is not reliable.Which is unfortunate, because it’s a good ideaItems used to charge are and IPhone 11 and an android charger.And the same problem exists in both. I will not charge it half the time.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Weak magnet to stay connected;A little disappointed in these charging cords.  It doesn't take much pressure for the magnet to come undone & not charge then.  I do like that it comes with 3 different types of chargers for different brands.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great chargers for the money.;These charging cords are perfect for the person that doesn't like fumbling around in the dark , to plug their phone charger in.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not the best.;One if the 6ft cords did not work.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Apple users, this does NOT work.;Anyone with an iPad or iPhone, you will get a  charging device not supported message.  Other devices with micro-usb work fine.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Great for charging but not suitable for apple play;Great for charging but not suitable for apple play
1.0 out of 5 stars;Great Idea, needs improvement;The concept and idea is great, the product looks great. Function wise the product is poor, the magnet could be stronger and the charge it provides coule be better. It takes 6+ hours to charge my galaxy 20 note ultra. But for it's intended purpose for car and charge on the go I should have just went with Anker. they're a reputable brand and functional unlike this product thay I have reviewed. If it actually stayed on and charged my phone at a decent time I'd probably recommend it. But i personally do not recommend this product.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Not too bad!;Reason i bought this were for my kids, they kept messing up the cords and with this it's so simple and less hassle. I noticed i had fast charge with my old cord and this don't but still gets the job done.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Ehhh…….;Will not work if you have a phone protection case, the little connector is too short to make contact unless you take the phone out of the case. Haven’t tried the charging yet but the cables are little shorter than I expected.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Returned. Didn't fit my pixel phone .;Returned. Didn't fit my pixel phone .
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great cords!;I like these cords so much I ordered a second set.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Very cool but broke within a few weeks;These charging cables and inserts are pretty awesome. It makes it so easy to magnetically put the cord onto the phone. I had zero complaints until yesterday part of the plug that goes into the phone broke apart. See pic.
4.0 out of 5 stars;;I like it.  I use it for my phone.
2.0 out of 5 stars;no used long time;These cable has four different size, and strong magnetic. but sometimes the cable can’t working good, and i need to charge again, and i used them more than one month, the cable didn’t work again
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great charger;I got these for my dad who has very low mobility and he loves being able to charge his devices without help. They are powerful and work great. I ended up getting some for my children too.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good product, but...;Just wish I could turn off the light. Other than that, good product.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Only lasted a week;At first we were very happy with the product but then one of the cables broke within a week of purchase
3.0 out of 5 stars;Low durability;I was disappointed that I barely had it in my phone for 24 hours and the magnetic part fell off. Luckily, there are more then one lightening charger magnetic plugs. I’m worried that the 2nd one won’t last either.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Charging power works about the same as a small potato;Product doesn't even give my phone a full charge with it being off in 12 HOURS! Would not recommend.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Make sure you keep a cord on hand;Takes a bit to get used to at first just remember to keep cords where you have your phone the most. As a truck driver tho this is a must have. It's a snap to charge your phone no fumbling around you can do it without looking.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Useless for modern smart phones;No data. No fast-charging. Why even have this as a product these days, especially at a price that matches products that do have those features.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Charger making sparks when connected to device.;The little inserts that go into your device have a metal ring around them that break off so easily. Within a month I had already went through 5. On most of them the whole metal circle came off, and on 2 the metal cracked and only half way fell off. As far as the cables, they just quit working, or they would spark when I connected it to my phone. VERY SCARY..
4.0 out of 5 stars;Love magnet charger.......does not work for Apple CarPlay !!;Does not work for Apple CarPlay !!
3.0 out of 5 stars;something wrong;Had this for about a week and three times I’ve woke up in the morning and my phone didn’t charge. Changed the cord and still not charging.
4.0 out of 5 stars;No data transfer or fast charging;Fine if all you want is a slow charge without data transfer capability.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charge;These are good but would be great if they were fast charge. There not...the magnetic hold will not be able to hold your phone dangling especially for the bigger phones like notes and iPhones. There too heavy.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Partially great;4 cords, 3 tip sets. Would have been 5 stars if complete.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Poor durability - I don’t recommend buying these cables;I got these twice because I thought they were great. But the do not last. The adapters that go into the device stops working and you have to replace it with another. The first time lasted over a month but the second only a week. I would not recommend buying this brand. Try another.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Easy to connect and disconnect;Easier to connect and disconnect.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good;Most things it will charge some it wont
3.0 out of 5 stars;Over night good while in use not so much;If your leaving your phone on a table over night to charge then this is good but i charge my phone while using it and this comes undone if moved or bumped
2.0 out of 5 stars;WHY YOUR PRODUCT DOESNT WORK AS DESCRIBED;BEFORE I RERURN THIS ITEM I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU THAT THE CHARGING CABLES DO NOT SEEM TO WORK WITH MY iPhone 8+. I HAVE TRIED ALL THREE CABLES. ONE IN MY CAR, TWO IN MY HOME. I ALSO TRIED THE CABLES ON MY WIFES AND SON'S PHONES. THEY DID NOT WORK EITHER. THE MAGNETS WORK, THE LIGHTS COME ON BUT, THEY DO NOT CHARGE. I WILL WAIT TWO DAYS FOR A REPLY TO THIS COMMENT BEFORE I REQUEST A REFUND AND A 1 (ONE STAR) RATING.THANKS,MICHAEL GOTROMGOTRO1@YAHOO.COM
3.0 out of 5 stars;Meh;I love the idea of this charging cable. It’s so convenient. It just doesn’t charge my phone that well. I have an iPhone 11 Pro.
2.0 out of 5 stars;I will be returning it. Not as described.;Only one of the cables are at a 90° angle. The rest are straight like an ordinary cable. Also, if I hold onto the cable and let my phone dsngle from it like in the picture shown, the cable disconnects from the phone. The connection is not as strong as described.
3.0 out of 5 stars;They are okay;I like the easy of use for multiple devices but they charge very slowly.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Light it much too bright;The blue light is too much.  Would buy a lot more if the cord were not lighted.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Works. No fast charge;Doesn't fast charge.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Smoothest;Great thought it a charger but the plug gets Super  hot When phone is on charge (untouchable) I wouldn’t recommend.
2.0 out of 5 stars;I wouldn't buy again;Buy this for my phone knowing it wasn't fast charging but my phone rarely needs charged more than just at night when I'm sleeping. But the magnet fell off during the night and I woke up to a dead phone.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Charging;Shape of the cable connector
3.0 out of 5 stars;Rec'vd as expected;Partner loves the magnetic connection,  but I do not... it falls off too easily....
1.0 out of 5 stars;Broke 5 days to late.;I recieved this product on February 22 and on March 25th the magnetic parts that you put into the phone had stopped working for 3 or the 4 ports for an Android device.  On the 26th of March the cords stopped working for 2 of the 4 cords that were in this package.  So now on March 27th only 1 magnetic part for a Android works and only 1 out of 4 of the cords work. This is unacceptable because there is only a 30 day return policy and everything started not working on day 35. 5 days after the 30 day return policy.  This totally is a pain because it's not like you can go to a store now a days. So guess my loss is a warning to others to not purchase this item.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Magnetic charging ends are plus!;One of tha cables I was using ended up not changing my cel phone... Convinance of the magnetic ends,  is a plus!! I do end up with a quicker full charge....
2.0 out of 5 stars;Just sad;Haven't  had these two full months and one of the six foot cords already  have a short in its magnetic  base where it lights up . Im not a happy  customer.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Does not work for all devices;Had issue with several devices, but worked for 80% of them.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Quick charge;Charges fine, easy to use but slips off easilt if you use your phone while charging.  Otherwise it charges quickly.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Dependable;Always a good buy, got the whole family using these
5.0 out of 5 stars;WORKS Great!;It's easy to use charges tablet and phones quickly allows quick connect and quick disconnect  love it...ordering another set for my kids!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Does not charge, actually drains battery;This product is poor quality. I used the lightning cable adapter for my iphone. It worked for one day, then stopped charging.  The adapter that fit into my headphones charging case would successfully charge the case, but as long as the adapter was in the case, the case wouldn't charge the headphones. That made it essentially useless. Do not buy.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Great for charging;The magnetic ability could be stronger, works on iPhone and Android.DOES NOT WORK WITH CAR PLAY AND ANDROID AUTO!!!  This was a kick to the groin.
3.0 out of 5 stars;They light up... That's annoying at night;They come with lots of tips and work great, my problem with these cables is they light up on the end which is really annoying at night when you're trying to sleep.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not for data transfer!;I buy it to be able to leave the magnetic peace inside all the time but I realize that it doesn't connect to my pc and it doesn't say in the description that it's not for data transfer I only find this information in a review so it isn't worth too much because I have to take it out a few times a day so  I return it right away.
3.0 out of 5 stars;It will slow charge but not enough power for a monitor.;I had free a portable monitor that is powered by a type C usb charger. With this charger the monitor wouldn't stay on. It would turn off & on.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Magnetic is not strong as advertised;The magnetic connector is not strong as advertised.  Power kept getting disconnected even when the phone sitting still on the table.  Not good for heavy and large phones.
3.0 out of 5 stars;There ok;They don’t work very well like it will stop charging at random times and then my phone won’t charge like last night my phone only got to 7% ( iPhone )
3.0 out of 5 stars;good, cable seems thin. needs stronger magnet;"i love it but magnet needs to be stronger. and we need ""tips for the cables"" too so i can use the 40 now obsolete cables i have laying around"
2.0 out of 5 stars;slow charge.;I had cables like this. I wanted for a few new devices and to have this kind of charger cord in my car and kitchen. Well they cables are fine but the plugs cause a slow charge. They cords work fine with old plugs but with either old cords or new I get a slow charge warning on kindles and my phone. It will not charge at all when in use but very very very slowly charge not in use.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not bad. But could be better.;This cable is everything it's supposed to be, but has a few flaws. Mainly being that with the plug left in the phone or whatever device it's plugged into the phone loses its charge faster than normal. As other reviews mentioned, it also doesnt charge as fast as other charging cables. I feel like it only charges about 75% as fast as a normal cable even on the Qualcomm charging base.Other than that, I just got it today and that's my initial impressions.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not compatible with Otterbox;With an Otterbox on your phone, the rubber tab over the charging port  keeps pushing the charger magnetic end off. Other than that issue, love these cables.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Eh... it’s ok;Seems ok I guess. 2 of the 4 cords don’t charge. They turn blue and start to charge then shut off. But for the price it’s whatever 2 work.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Does not Fast Charge Samsung Galaxy;Normal charge is fine.  However does not Fast Charge my device.  When I switch to my older aftermarket USB cable, my device will Fast Charge. Will be returning.
3.0 out of 5 stars;It's okay;I don't like how it connects to the devices. There are better ones out there that have more than just one point of contact.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not great.;The design of these sort of sucks with most phone cases. The magnets are very weak and overall it feels flimsy which is a shame. I bought a replacement.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not for in use charging.;They definitely don't charge as well as regular cables. It's fine if it's charging while not in use, but for car rides with maps going, it's pretty useless.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Convenient when multitasking;Great concept but they do shift out of place from charging while driving and I also don’t like how difficult it is to get the connector piece out of your phone’s charger port.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Poor duration;I don’t like
2.0 out of 5 stars;Great for charging, beware bright light.;These are okay. The DO NOT TRANSFER DATA (charging only). Also the bright blue light is pretty annoying if you have it on your night stand. I like that they came with multiple connectors which basically makes your charging cables universal to all your devices.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good for older Samsung Galaxy;Works well on my J7 Prime Galaxy but won't charge my iPhone 6 or iPad Pro. So buyer beware.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't charge fast enough;I use it to play games on my phone while charging but thing is, it charges so slow that my phone ened up dying
3.0 out of 5 stars;Decent cable;Initial thoughts was it was a good product but recently I have my concerns.  Case around one of the cables has started coming loose.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Good but seems cheap;Convince is the big factor for these and I do like the fact it keeps debris out of my charger port but upon receiving I tested each connector and 3 out 4 of the usb c connectors wouldn't work with 2 devices.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not compatible with most cases;I really don’t like that it swivels around while charging, a few tips didn’t work to charge at all (I have an Iphone), also does not work with life proof cases thin version. Really any case.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Worked for a week.;I got these chargers for my children so they would stop plugging out the cords on their iPads. Within the first week they all stopped turning blue and would not charge.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great for price;It’s the best tool ever, very easy to use
2.0 out of 5 stars;Good idea, but badly constructed.;Really needs a manual that says what each charge insert is. One IOS adapter worked and other didn't. Also magnetic cord system does not hold tight. Comes apart just by picking the phone up.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't work;It works on the first 2 day's after that it takes for ever to charge a phone or sometimes nothing at all
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works well;Ideally I wanted this for charging / linking my phone to my car quickly and easily. It does say in the description that it doesn't transfer data so that's my bad. Still good cables though and will keep it.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Helps you miss your old cords;Cord not staying attached to your phone? Try these, they'll make you miss your old cords the way dating a crazy person makes you miss your ex
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good product;Work as shown but they do charge slow if you use your phone while pluged in
2.0 out of 5 stars;Great concept but needs some work;Conflicted with these. One charges my iPhone and the other one doesn’t. The magnet is not strong enough to stay on in some of the connections it comes with, I wish the magnet was a bit stronger and came with longer cord lengths. Great concept but needs some work. Some won’t charge my iPad at all as it says “ not compatible”. One says it is charging but then removed from cord, it did not charge at all.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Only works on limited devices;Nicely designed.  Works well on iPod and Samsung Galaxy Tab 7”. Does not work on older version iPad mini, iPhone 11 or iPhone 12, Nintendo Switch. So out of all of the devices here, it only works on 2!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Connectivity;It takes a while to connect.
3.0 out of 5 stars;"Cheap chrome coating on adapters; flakes off.";Doesn’t work with phones with cases. Adapters are not durable and chrome flakes off and shorts out the charge / drains phone faster.
1.0 out of 5 stars;The tips for iPhobe fail.;This item is a good idea, unless you are active or live in warm and/or humid climates. The tips tend to fail due to “painted” circuitry. They first iPhone tip failed within 24 hours. I lost an additional one each week. I am down to the last one, but I will be getting a refund.Also, the cord tends to randomly short out. While charging it cuts in and out so that it never gives a charge. I never figured out why.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not compatible with the fast charging;Not compatible with the fast charging
3.0 out of 5 stars;Awesome but..;These cables are really awesome !! just that 2 of the micro usb is not working, all the 10 micro parts works perfect
5.0 out of 5 stars;Have bought several sets;I have bought several sets of these magnetic charging cords. It has extended the life of my phone and tablets. The charge ports were wearing out on my electronics before I discovered these. What a great idea.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't fast charge;Won't fast charge my pixel 3xl , disappointed it seemed like a great product other then the 3 hour charge vs 30 minutes
1.0 out of 5 stars;Connection is very poor;The connectors do not connect well and you really have to check if things are actually charging. Plus, it will stop charging if you leave it alone.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging;Seems like a good product.  Not fast charging though.  I tried using the the factory chargers with them to no success.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Cheap is cheap;It's a slow charge and the specified tip can only be used with this cable.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Bien producto;Muy útil y fácil
5.0 out of 5 stars;Ree;It’s so convenient to use. I don’t have to switch chargers between my kindle and my iPhone or iPad.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Weak magnet;The cable works, but the magnet is very weak. Yes it can hold your phone upside down, but thw slightwst movement or tilt and it lets go. And if anyrhing bumps the phone or cable it lets go. No where near steong enough to get a reliable charge. Phone keeps beeping when it gets and loses the connection. I am disappointed. Cant charge and use phone without being very careful of the cable.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice;Works good
1.0 out of 5 stars;Bad experience;Not even a year, hardly even half a year and if gone through every single cord. Some don’t work, some charge extremely slow. My phone died and one of these cords took so long to power my phone back on. Not good. Thrown them out.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Weak Magnetic Connection;Everything about the cable is perfect. However the magnet isn’t very strong. It disconnects from the device as soon as it is touched .  Forget about using it to retrieve a device that slipped down a crack while still charging. The cable stops working after a year. My picture is a screenshot of my phone plugged in and the green charging light isn’t on
1.0 out of 5 stars;SO DANGEROUS;I bought these for both my iPhone and my husband’s. They charge incredibly fast, however the port got so so hot on both of our phones that it was hot enough to burn my finger on several occasions. The charging ports stopped working after only a month and a second lasted only that long as well. These are cheap and the level of heat created during charging is absolutely a fire hazard. Don’t buy.
3.0 out of 5 stars;No CarPlay Compatibility;Not working with CarPlay. I use for iPad only.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Do not buy!;I read all the comments and still bought to give it a try. This is a very cheap product that it doesn’t even charge certain devices, slow charge and even poor materials. Got this to use with my keyboard and it doesn’t even work, tried multiple tips and cables and its just a cheap product, is great for low power items.
2.0 out of 5 stars;great idea, poor execution;they were great at first but then I found that multiple cables would stop working. The magnets are only strong when directly pulling outwards, but the moment you push on it or pull on it at anything not at 90 degrees, it will immediately come lose.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Barely work;Weak magnet so it disconnects really easy. It does not always charge. It also trips my power strip.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Started out great but now...;I loved these cords when I first got them but they have recently stopped charging very well. In the beginning it charged my phone almost as quickly as my original charger (which is breaking) however, now when I try to use these cords it takes hours to charge or it doesn't charge at all. ( by hours I mean 15-20 hours)
3.0 out of 5 stars;Worked ok for a while;Slow charging, round magnet keeps coming off
3.0 out of 5 stars;Don’t;After 2 months they don’t work anymore don’t buy
4.0 out of 5 stars;...;Ok
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not a great product;I have had these for months now, and we only used them for a few weeks. The magnet charging is great, and very convenient. But it doesn't fast charge, and the magent isn't strong enough to hold the phone like on the pictures.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Meh;Worked well at first. Then started not working. Magnet is not strong enough to use devise while charging.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped working;Not even a month after the return period ended, one of the three cords stopped working
2.0 out of 5 stars;If you dont charge your phone daily this will work for you;Started put good but after a month or do charging times started increasing. Bought different cord and went back to charging normally again. Magnets would not as strong as shown. Past return time so just ate the loss and moved on
3.0 out of 5 stars;Battery juice;Same speed as normal power cord, not as strong of swivel magnet part to it
2.0 out of 5 stars;Nice idea, didn’t work long.;Easily detached from magnet and so you do not get charged!  Stopped working completely after a month and a half. Not worth the money.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Error 404 charger not found!!!;Oooooookay.I was really excited about this product but it just didn’t work. The dongles were extremely finicky and didn’t work half the time. The magnets were strong at first but became weak rather quickly (after only a week of use). The lengths were good. And the idea is really good!!It just didn’t work as well as I had hoped.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Simple-to-use;Love the fact that it charges quickly & just is connected without plugging it in...
3.0 out of 5 stars;Great but magnet lacks magnetism;Charges fast, flexible but I found the magnet to not be very strong. Clearly not as powerful as the ad shows.
5.0 out of 5 stars;the best ever- 10 stars;this is the best excellent highly recommend , super fast charging ..10 stars
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not what to expect;I figured these would work great for charging the kids tablets and phones. Not the case. The charger has to be placed perfectly on it for it to charge. Even while sleeping if barley bumped it stops charging.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works;Works
4.0 out of 5 stars;good;good
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not happy with this purchase;They are long and durable but don’t work with my kid’s iPads. I bought these for them so that it will be easier for them to charge their devices by themselves. They worked for 2-3 days.  They don’t work anymore. The device shows that its charging, turn on after like 10-15 mins, 5% charged, and then turns off with in seconds. All the cables in this set are doing this same thing. They work fine with the apple cables that came with them.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Type-C charging don't work!;I love the idea and the length of the cords and the different ports you get. The micro usb works fine but the Type-C doesn't work my phone will not charge at all and my son tablet only get about 30% charged in about 8hrs. My kids tablet was the main reason for buying g this product. Kind of disappointing...
2.0 out of 5 stars;Magnet doesn’t stay on good.;Good in theory but IPhones will not do automatic updates with this charger. One piece stays on phone all the time and once in place very difficult to remove for you to use ear buds, or use regular charger. Worst part is magnets fall off easy. My husband likes it because he has Samsung phone where you have separate headphone jack and he doesn’t worry about phone updates.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Works wonderful;It works wonderful, but I did not get all 4 cables, I did not get the 3' side adapt cable. Be aware.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Poor introduction to magnetics!;"The media could not be loaded.
                



 This product advertises a 360 degree rotation. The Claim is absolutely false!!! I will illustrate later and  edit this as to why it is a false claim, and I will explain to you what does have a 360 rotation and why these are garbage. Don’t waste your money on a product that claims to be something it’s not!"
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good but slowly;I don't know why but it's a little slow charging than another cables o regular cables
2.0 out of 5 stars;One adapter broke on first use;One of the lightning adapters broke on first use. Apparently there is only one way to plug the lightening adapter in. If you flip it over when you insert it, it will not charge
2.0 out of 5 stars;Strength;What I dislike about this that the magnet is not as strong as they said it is.  If you using while driving please please do not let it touch the floor of the car.  It will pick up any magnetic scraps that keep your phone from charging full speed
2.0 out of 5 stars;Charging speed is prehistoric;Charging power is near non existent I’ve gained about 10 percent in nearly an hour. Everything else is fantastic
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not great. Wouldn't get too excited;It's an awesome concept and I was really excited for this. Charges incredibly slow. It doesn't go up if I'm using my phone while it charges. Even if I don't use it, it still barely goes up 1% every 3 minutes. Takes approx 4-5 hours to fully charge without using during. One is the adaptors also stopped working after one use.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Strong magnet;If you have these it doesn't fast charge like the regular cable with the fast charge power outlet
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not compatible with IPHONE!;These  cables will not charge my iphone.  I'm also having a problem returning them.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not powerful.;I bought these for my son's tablet because he is careless about how he plugs it in and started to warp the charging port. These basically trickle charge. It is not enough for a tablet. It was dying while charging and watching a YouTube video.
1.0 out of 5 stars;There is really no point;Looks like a smart idea, but really impractical.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not made to last.;Maybe had this for a month or so and the usb C cable came apart in my phone. Not sure I wanna risk charging anything else with it anymore.
3.0 out of 5 stars;slow chargeing;took too long to charge
2.0 out of 5 stars;Good charging cable. But not for data;It's a good charging cable very cool easy design saves the wear and tear on your USB port. But will not transfer data so if you're plugging into an Android auto or apple clay it will not transfer your maps on deer display. only a charging cable not a data transfer cable .
5.0 out of 5 stars;Convenient!! Adapters provided;It's very nice to be able to use the same cord for a variety of devices. These work well for iPhones, iPads, Samsung phones (USB-C), and micro-USB devices.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Cool concept;Cool concept. Takes forever to charge smart items.  The wire feels nice and sturdy.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Se rompen con facilidad;Se rompen con facilidad, no los compren
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not really worth buying;I bought on July 27, 2020 and I only have 1 Apple tip left that works and 2 cords that work. Everything else already decided they would quit. I don’t normally have issues with chargers but I tried these and they don’t last long at all.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped working in 4 months;I was quite happy with these cords at first. They came recommended. Now I have the longest of the set which does not work. I have tried it in various USB outlets and on several devices. Nothing.These were not inexpensive...I expect better durability from charging cords.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good, but not great;The cables themselves worked really well. I found the adapters broke really easily.
5.0 out of 5 stars;A great product;No more fumbling trying to hit the right port. Excellent product!
2.0 out of 5 stars;I like it to a point;It always comes undone
4.0 out of 5 stars;Calidad;Ecelente
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not good / compatible with iphone long term;I initially loved these chargers! But-- I have iphone XR and recently the charger started saying that it has water in it and it cannot charge (when it hasnt been anywhere near water) and i can plug a normal charger in without issue. Has worked on other devices fine but my main phone is iphone and this isnt good for that.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Disappointing to say the least;Nothing to like really about this product. Only worked occasionally and even then not very well.  I have new non magnetic charging cords in order.  Chalking this item up to a bad choice on my part.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Works good, but check your cables!;Product works great, however one of my 6ft cables is faulty. phone estimates almost one and a half hours of charging time to go from 87% to 100%. Other cables estimate less time.Other than that, seems like a solid product
2.0 out of 5 stars;Don't hold up.;Great idea, but they stopped working after a few months. Cleaned the mating ends, no improvement.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Super Charged!;Wonderful surprise on the quality.  Love the 360 spin and led light. Several friends ordered  some as soon as they saw mine!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not for me.;I have a thick case (otter box -defender) and it doesn’t work with the case.  Actually I can’t see it working with any case. So if you are one that doesn’t carry a case then it might work for you but it would stick out of your phone. I wouldn’t like that
2.0 out of 5 stars;Does Not Fast Charge As Advertised;The magnet is very weak and these cables do NOT fast charge as advertised. I like that there are 4 different cord lengths, the blue LED light is nice and bright and it does charge your device, however I purchased mainly for fast charging capability, so I will be returning.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Broke first day.;Magnetic separated from the plug first day. No customer support, no way to register product! Look at others, do not buy.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Too slow to be useful in any way;The magnets aren't quite strong enough and the lack of swivel heads causes connection issues.  All that said, these charge too slow to be of any use these days.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Strong magnets;I ended up returning beware people with medical implants may have issues around the strong magnets.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Unreliable;Nice idea, poor execution….. unreliable and weak connection on all the cords and adapters.  I bought two packs, and two packs of each type with the idea being of having one universal cord.  It is too easy to loose connection,  a flick of the cord and it pops off.
5.0 out of 5 stars;super convenient plus with the end of cord lite up in a soft blue light, easy to see;fast and easy to use and eliminates the need to see the charging port on the devise.. magnetic hook up works great
2.0 out of 5 stars;Does not work for iPad 2019 or iPad Pro 2017!;The cable and the connectors work fine for my Galaxy S2 tab, S8 active phone, iPhone XR and iPhone 8 plus. BUT it does not work for my iPad 2019 or iPad Pro 2017 tablet.  The description is not clear so i bought the cables to primarily use them with my tablets. Very disappointing...SO BEWARE!!!
2.0 out of 5 stars;It’s ok 😕;Tbh it’s ok!Charges veryyyyyyyy slow, and doesn’t work for usb purposes (wish I knew this before because my husband still have to use my charger sometimes “ugh”)Had it for a while and still works but slowIt’s good quality physically!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Best look and feel of any magnetic charging cable BUT doesn't charge devices.;"The cable looks and feels amazing. Better than all of the others I've tried, and I've tried a lot. But they do not charge any of my devices. My iPad says Not Charging when plugged in, and my Galaxy Note 10 says ""Use the charger that comes with the device"" when charging. I cannot recommend this product."
2.0 out of 5 stars;Cord;Had a magnet come out of the socket within the first few days, the 90 degree plug is the most durable
3.0 out of 5 stars;Disappointed;Charge time was 2-3 times longer than conventional cable.
1.0 out of 5 stars;All of the bases broke one by one;Great idea, poor execution.  Each base ceased to function after about a weeks usage.  Tried in multiple phones to make sure and they no longer worked.  One broke completely in two just separating the cord from the base.  I won’t waste my money on this brand again.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charge, broken pieces;Was really excited to receive this produxt but that has gone away. Unfortunately one of the chargers stopped working. The magnet of one of the adapters broke off and they are very slow to charge. Not sure if my product was just defective.
2.0 out of 5 stars;No data transfer capabilities. Charging only.;Cords are unable to transfer data. I wish I would have known that before purchasing. Instead I found it buried in the description. Totally useless for me since it was purchased for in vehicle use. I don’t know why the seller even advertises it since modern vehicles use USB ports to play audio.
2.0 out of 5 stars;complete waste;only 2 of the cords actually worked. one of the others worked for like a week then nothing. it was not worth trying to return. about the only thing i thought they had going for them was the different lengths of the cords.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Will not connect to Android Mobile app.;Will not connect with Android Mobil app, but will charge phone.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Awesome cords;Cord length
3.0 out of 5 stars;No fast charging;Does what it's supposed to do but not fast charging.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Works but sparks sometimes;Works as intended but possibility of causing sparks on awkward connection moments. Tossing this out.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Never going back.;These are super convenient.
3.0 out of 5 stars;It convinces;It dont transfer data when driving a vehicle
5.0 out of 5 stars;Better get one now;This was a nice set of cables a case for the pieces would be nice Definitely helped solve some issues in my house
1.0 out of 5 stars;Baja carga;El producto en calidad es bueno pero almenos en mi Samsung Galaxy S21 plus no da suficiente carga y el teléfono siempre salta la alerta de que no da suficiente potencia, incluso probando con otro cargador. Asi que es una mala compra
2.0 out of 5 stars;Don’t waste your money;Product sounds great in theory, but the cords charge when they want. I’d plug it to my phone and it wouldn’t charge for 5 minutes or even all night. Also, they don’t connect to my cars audio (2018 Ford F-150). Don’t buy it, it’s not worth it.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Safety Hazard- Melted;Loved the concept but really disappointed that we had 2 get very hot.  Noticed one a few weeks ago that was hot to the touch and melted and today smelled a hot burning smell and found the clear portion melting outward.  Unsafe.
5.0 out of 5 stars;So much easier!;I have neuropathy in my hands, and it was getting harder to plug in my android phone.  This makes it so much easier!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Utterly disappointed;I was really excited for this product but have come across two huge problems. First is that the chargers will occasionally stop working for no reason. I can’t use these cables in my car (only thinking about charging) and even in wall ports they will randomly shut off. Then when they do work, they overheat easily and one of mine even began sparking. I ordered a replacement in hopes that these issues were simply a batch issue and will update this review if it is. However as it stands I would not recommend this product
2.0 out of 5 stars;lasted 4 months.;the light turns on the cord but it doesn't charge.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Broke after normal use.;This was not a good purchase. Cords stopped working only after the return window was closed so now I can’t even return it. The only good thing about these cords were the length. Some of the magnetic adapters don’t even work properly and some I have to fiddle to with the cord. Would not recommend this product.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Don't fast charge;Don't fast charge
1.0 out of 5 stars;NO DATA TRANSFER. ERROR MESSAGE ON PHONE SAYING SLOW CHARGE;This item does not transfer data therefore if you're trying to use it with your cars GPS it will not work. Continuous error messages saying to use original charge cord because cord being used is insufficient and could cause significant damage to the battery.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Tips stop working;This product seems like a great product - so much so that I've converted all our devices to using these charging cables. But - the tips are not as long life as I would hope. I leave it in an iPhone and they just stop charging. It's not the outlet or the cord that is the problem - put a new tip in and it works fine again. But the tips only seem to last me 1-2 months tops. That makes this a pretty expensive/high maintenance charger with less than ideal durability.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Type C tips broke within a month;Two connector tips that go into the device came apart in two pieces after one month from moderate use. The two others did not have a strong fit and came out of my device and were lost. I love the idea but now I have 6 useless cables and no connector tips. 😥
2.0 out of 5 stars;Don't use with iOS devices;Charging gets slower the longer you use them with iPhone. Eventually stops charging completely, happen on iPhone se and iPad mini 4. Once I used the OEM charger they charged normally again. I stopped using on all iOS devices and will watch Pixels closely for the same symptoms.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Unsafe!;Unsafe!  After charging my phone, cord was unplugged and dropped on a table where it accidentally can in contact with a piece of metal.  Luckily I was sitting next to it and noticed the blue light began to glow brighter.  When I picked it up, I immediately dropped it because it was too hot to hold.  I quickly unplugged and noticed the entire cord was hot.  I have gathered them all up and they are now in the trash.
5.0 out of 5 stars;easy to use;easy to use
3.0 out of 5 stars;Magnic not strong enough to hold in  Activities;Magnic needs to be stronger other than it works great
2.0 out of 5 stars;durability;Works good for a few weeks then the first adapter stopped. About 12 months later tossed it all. Good concept but needs durability. Also, doesn't charge as fast as native charger.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Quality isn't as advertised.;Only used it for about a day to charge my phone at night and tried to charge it this morning and the charging tip was stuck onto the cord magnet. It's a good product idea but quality isn't the best. I notice this is very common with products that are manufactured by smaller companies in China.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Point of connection gets hot while charging;The magnet are not strong enough. When charging my phone it say it’s a slow charge. The other thing that scares me is the part that connects to the device gets very hot while charging. That concerns me to the point I only charge when it’s around me.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Just doesn't work;I like nothing about this item. Just doesn't stay Attached. Lots of pieces just doesn't work
2.0 out of 5 stars;Nice but short lived.;They started off great but little by little they all stop working. Seriously bummed out that these die out so quickly. I only have one iPhone top left that works and 2 cables left that work. Don’t understand why because they’re always in the same place, never moved or mishandled.  Disappointing
2.0 out of 5 stars;Does not do what I want it to for stay charged;It does not work for me.It come apart when you unplug it
2.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charging;Very slow charging,You have to leave it in a flat place and make sure that it is well connected, any contact with the cable can disconnect it or make it not have a good connection
2.0 out of 5 stars;It does NOT charges fast!;Do not charge Fast charging speed as say the description. I tested and it actually charges really slow. My phone (Galaxy S10+) even pop up a window warning to charge with a faster cable. Charging was slow taking about over 6 hours to get 100%Item returned.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Work, but very slow charging.;They work for charging. However, they're very slow. Will not charge very fast at all. I would not recommend them.
2.0 out of 5 stars;No comment;Fall off too easy. Don't fir with Otterbox cases.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good but not strong enough;It’s works but the magnetic part is not strong
5.0 out of 5 stars;Reliable product;Nice selection of cord lengths  reliable
2.0 out of 5 stars;None working products received;Unfortunately I do like the product but the side mount magnetic charging cord does not work.  I woul send it back but no longer have box and other cords work fine. Would have been nice to have all the charger cords I got work properly.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Returned;Bought  a different set, return these
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not functional;This is a decent product, however. not very functional. It only charges when the phone is off. If you try to charge while still using the phone or maintain the current charge, it fails. The charge is not enough to support basic use and you will lose battery charge.
5.0 out of 5 stars;I will continue to buy these!;Love it so much i bought more.No more stress on my charge ports! No more fumbling with plugs.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great CS;The tip quit working. They sent me a replacement right away.  Very happy with their CS.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Poor magnets;Just got these cables, they work fine for charging which is why I got them. The problem is the magnets, my fridge magnets are stronger than these, you barely touch these and they disconnect. The pictures showing a phone swinging..... Yeah... Right, no way no how.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Terrible wire;I had gotten this two or three months ago and the wires have stopped working properly and it really hard for me in the mornings since I wake up to see that my phone didn’t even charge properly due to the terrible wire problem
1.0 out of 5 stars;These suck;These charging cables suck which makes the whole product worthless. They constantly stop charging for absolutely no reason. I just received these and even during my first use of the cords they would stop working. I bought these because my father gifted me a magnetic cord to try out and I really liked it. But those must have been a different brand because they actually worked.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Beat charger;These are so much better than the other ones I purchased. I have 1cable for my tablet and phone!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Okay;While some of the wires worked, they didn’t inside my car.
1.0 out of 5 stars;m is for meh...not magnet;it doesn't charge quickly or at all  magnet doesn't hold like depicted
5.0 out of 5 stars;5 star;Love it. Cant see myself  breaking  another charging  port thanks to this
1.0 out of 5 stars;Poor durability and quality control;The first plug I used broke when I dropped my phone from my pocket onto a carpeted floor.There were more plugs that came with the cords so I was able to replace them.However, only some of the plugs would actually charge properly while others would not.The lack of durability and consistent charging forces me to give this a one star review
1.0 out of 5 stars;Did not work out of box;I had a similar cable for my old Samsung tablet using the standard USB end. I got a new Samsung tablet that uses USB C. The tablet did not recognize the charging cable. I even tried different battery settings-no luck.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not durable;Cables stopped charging after about 2 weeks of use
2.0 out of 5 stars;Car play won’t work with this usb cable;It won’t work with car play
1.0 out of 5 stars;Look closely at the picture;Picture of 4 pack compared to 3 pack.  Compare price seems to be better to buy 4 pack: not true. You would assume  you would get 1 pack more, not true.  You actually pay $4 dollars for a 1' cable. Lick my wounds and carry on. I have learned to look at all descriptions as well as price. Magnetic Charging Cable (4 Pack,1ft/3ft/3ft/6ft), Terasako 3-in-1 Nylon Braided Cord.  You do not get 1 pack more.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Cool idea, but needs some improvement.;It's a cool idea, but it doesn't have the charging power for my phone. I kept getting a message from my phone to use the original charger to get a faster charge
2.0 out of 5 stars;Ok;Charging is very slow finally just gave up went back to a standard cord
3.0 out of 5 stars;Bright light;I don’t like the moving lights
1.0 out of 5 stars;DO NOT WORK ON FAST CHARGING;PLEASE, DON'T BUY THESE. If you have fast charging they are NOT compatible. The magnets DON'T suck but they sure are junk. These will now be relegated to e-reader and headphone chargers.EDIT: This company has now been emailing me NON-STOP with offers for amazon gift cards IF I remove this bad review. They are trying to say they can't pay their credit card bills because of bad reviews. PLEASE don't buy from companies that BUY good reviews. Their products should earn the review NOT monetary compensation.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Don’t buy !!!!;Bought it and none of the cords work on two different phones. A waste of money. Now I have to wait around for my item to be retuned to even get a refund!!! So please don’t waste your time or money!!!!!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Just what I needed;Has lots of lengths and adapters
2.0 out of 5 stars;Disappointed;Not a good charger. Works as well as the dollar store cord I bought it just didn't have magnets
2.0 out of 5 stars;I can't use it for my Samsung 8+;The magnetic plug doesn't fit into my Samsung Galaxy 8+. This is why I gave it a 2 star. The plug fits in my , notebook , and wireless earphones.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Already broken;Had this for only a month one broke off in my tablet and these wires are not charging my phone. Work up with 3% this morning. The magnet is not strong like it says it is. Don't buy this.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't work correctly;Did not charge my phoneStarted to then would stop after a few seconds.Not to mention when it was charging it said like 3+ hours so really slow too.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Love them;Make it easy to connect for charging and just pops off when you need your phone.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Disappointed;The charging power was slow. ☹
5.0 out of 5 stars;its worth it to get it;its easy to use and strong very good item no problems so far
2.0 out of 5 stars;Just okay;Price was good and easy to use. The magnet was definitely not as strong as portrayed.  I attempted to duplicate hanging the phone (S7) from the cord and it fell right away.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging;I love the versatility of these chargers,  but they are not fast charging and I don't want to wait 5 hours for my S8+ to charge from 20%.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Never but it again;I like the cords, but I don't like how strong the magnetic is Very Weak! Also you need to make sure the connection is clean before connect the cord.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Product didn't work;This product did not work. Lights came on but nobody was home didn't charge my phone at all. Took it back the next day.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't Move Enough Power;These cables don't seem to be able to move enough power. No matter what power supply I use (as big as 5V 3A) I can't charge and use navigation at the same time. It will be plugged and still actively drain when using Wyze or Google Maps. This persists through multiple power supplies and phones (Pixel 3a, moto X4).
2.0 out of 5 stars;"Very weak charging; not worth it.";Not strong enough to charge most devices. Gives my pixel 3XL a trickle charge. Incapable of charging iPhone 11 or Arctis 7 wireless headset. Basically not worth it.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Nope;Didn’t work for long. I thought it was my phone...I got a new phone and it still speed working.  I asked for a replacement port and never got it
1.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charge;It's a very slow charge and will not stay connected. I used one foe my Samsung and an IPhone, same issues. Do not recommend.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Adaptors for iphone cannot handle normal use;The iphone adaptors stopped working after a few weeks. They ship three of them so I wasn’t worries when the first one crapped out, but now I’m down to one amd I know it will fail soon like the others. Not a good deal if you plan to use this on a day to day basis or around even a bit of moisture, like on a rainy day for example.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Problems with magnets & cords;Love the ease of use. Magnets are not even close to being strong enough, these are nothing but junk!So far I have a problem with the magnets not being strong enough, and with 1 - 6” cord, and the 3” cord having what seems to be a short in them. The light, when you pick up the cords go on and off.
2.0 out of 5 stars;iPhone insert breaks;The actual piece that fits into the iPhone continues to break. I am having to re-order – other than that I have enjoyed the product.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Came on time;Love this !!! Wish it came with more plug extensions
2.0 out of 5 stars;Would not recommend;It works really well for the first couple weeks then they all stop working completely, at least that’s what happened to me.
1.0 out of 5 stars;SLOOOOWWWWWWW;This is the slowest charger ever! Plugged my phone in for about 10 minutes to get some juice before getting on a call and the battery only went up 2%. I wasn't even using the phone while it was connected. Bought a different type that actually works.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Meh;Meh. I bought two sets and the biggest complaint so far is they are not fast charging and some of the cables know off too easily.
5.0 out of 5 stars;They're Ok;The cables charge at a decent speed but not too slow
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not happy cheap;I have went thru three ports already and one cord just stop working  not happy at all
2.0 out of 5 stars;Don’t buy;In under a day one of the cords wont charge cause it can’t make the connection. It’s slow to charge and cant even data exchange.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Certainly not the lightning cable;Don’t expect fast charger with these cables they are very very slow when it comes to charging and I have tried them in numerous different chargers including direct from the wall and they are very slow!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Magnets are weak;I noticed right off just how weak the magnetic connection is, attempting to work while charging especially, the slightest movement makes connectivity to come lose and I’m being driven nuts by the sound made when it’s reconnecting.Not as advertised and not worth the hassle verses just buying the other cords when worn.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Buen producto, pero....;Buen producto, pero el cable no se ve de buena calidad
1.0 out of 5 stars;Absolutely worthless;Sounds cool and handy but they worked for approximately four charges and now it just flashes on and off.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Good for many things, not for apple products;Works well charging other devices like battery,  rechargeable devices android phones. iPhones and ipad are too sensitive to accept the charge.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Broke the first day;"I ordered 2 sets of these and 2 cords out of both sets didn't work from the time I got them. I guess it's a ""you get what you pay for"" kind of thing."
2.0 out of 5 stars;Magnets are weak. Doesn't transfer files;Magnets are weak. Doesn't transfer files. The angled chargers don't even fit if you have a case on.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Good for a week or so;I’m not sure about all of the adapters, but the lighting adapter only lasted us a week. Tried on multiple devices. Doesn’t work any more.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Super neat;I like using these chargers for everything but my phone. It's really nice when all of your stuff uses the same charger. No hassle trying to find the right size charger for your device. It doesn't fast charge my phone though so I don't use it for that. I have an s21
2.0 out of 5 stars;DO NOT BUY;Two cord have already stopped working. Two of the lightning cable adapters didn’t work straight out of the box. Not worth the buy.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Worthless for iPhones.;This product does not charge my iPhone. Since this is why I bought it, that seems pretty damning.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Barely lasted a month;"The little magnetic ""plugs"" don't stay in, and eventually the cable end stops connecting to the plug end in the phone.  Despite being magnetic, the two pieces won't connect and charge anymore.  I have had this set for a month.  Absolute waste of money.  So cheap."
2.0 out of 5 stars;They don't last long.;Cables always seem to have a short lifespan.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Great at first but not after some usage;These worked great at first because my kids were always pulling their devices off the charge cord and breaking it. After some use though, the center connector seems to stop making contact and is unable to charge. This is a great idea but the durability is missing.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Does not charge my phone;The idea is great but it will not charge my phone. My phone requires a 2 amp or greater power source.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great;These charge so much faster.  They are great
2.0 out of 5 stars;Durability is not great;Broke about six months after purchase
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not a good product. Stopped working with no abuse etc;The roundness makes it hard and almost doesn’t work if you have a phone cover. Also the don’t stay in that well. Also after a few weeks they simply keep shorting out. Poor quality
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not worth the money;Magnets too weak to stay connected. Not Apple cert. quit working on iPhone even though packaging said for iPhone 8.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not worth the money!;It worked perfectly for a month then one day each one slowly stopped working! Great idea but poor execution!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Dont last;Worked for a couple weeks. Then one by one the cords stopped charging. No longer blue.
5.0 out of 5 stars;If your iPhone charging port is worn, this is a great fix.;Product is great. Amazon delivered to neighboring address.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Didn't hold up;This was my 2nd time ordering these cables and while I love the magnetic feature, they have not held up to daily use. All cords frayed and broke where cord meets the magnetic end.
2.0 out of 5 stars;no fast charge;sadly these cables do not support fast charge.  Already i have had two usb c connectors break.  :(
2.0 out of 5 stars;Want just a slower charge???;Great concept but they charge slow as well as data won't transfer with their cord.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Didn’t last a week;Didn’t even last a week. So annoying to get it to charge. Not worth it
1.0 out of 5 stars;very poor product;very poor contact with matching connector and did not charge properly at all . 4 out of 5 tries failed to establish a good connection with contactors at magnetic coupling.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Spoiled product.;I got a spoiled cable and 3spoiled lightning charging head. Is there any ways I can get a replacement? And it was spoil when I open it and try to charge and if failed to charge but when I try the others which are fine it works.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Inconsistent;Charging is extremely slow not worth it sadly because it look awesome
1.0 out of 5 stars;Lost;I give such a low start because if you lose the piece that goes into your phone then the rest of it is useless. And it comes unattached very easy when moved. Only used for about a month or so n now I don't even know where they are!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Wouldn't recommend;Takes 5 hrs to charge my phone. Magnet isn't very strong the cord is always falling off.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not what I expected;Didn’t work with my car play and it was really hard to get the charging piece out of my phone.

1.0 out of 5 stars;Messed up my beats wireless earphones;As soon as I tried to use it, it caused a spark and my earphones dont turn on no more smh not worth it. Glad it wasnt my phone
1.0 out of 5 stars;Beware!! Could cause permanent damage to your devise.;These were great, until they weren’t. It started to over heat in my phone and smell like burning rubber.

1.0 out of 5 stars;the product sucks.  Wont charge, have to keep replacing the part that goes I the device. JUNK!;Junk
3.0 out of 5 stars;So Bright!!!;They work great, the only problem is they are SO BRIGHT! Seriously just when plugged in they glow, when charging they glow, they glow so bright that I have to bury my phone underthings or charge it in a different room because it is so bright.
3.0 out of 5 stars;iPAD alert!!;I can confirm this charger works for the 8th gen iPad, HOWEVER....... if you let the battery drain completely, this charger will not work.  You'll have to connect the charger that came with the iPad, let it charge a few percent, then you can reconnect this charger.  In other words, don't buy this if you are wanting to use it for an iPad.  I imagine it works the same way on all the iPad generations.  This is probably because it's not MFi certified.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Delicate, so you'll need extra connectors;It works but its very delicate. The phone fell once and the tip was done for.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Works well!;Works well but it needs stronger magnet on the part that goes inside phone
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not My Favorite Charger;The magnets do not stay connected well if you have to use the phone while charging.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Needs work.;Doesn't charge well. Sometimes not at all.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Disapointing and leaves a lot of information out;1) very slow to charge anything2) although it highlights charging in the car it does not work with appple car playSlow to charge, th only good thing about the device is that its easy to connect. But unlike regular wires to play anything in the car you need to use bluetooth and the wire does not play directly like a regular wire would
4.0 out of 5 stars;I only got 3 cords - but the cords work great.;I just realized that I was supposed to get 4 cords but only got 3, one that is about 10 inches, and the other 2 are probably 4 feet.  I should've paid attention because now it's too late.  Oh well, i would buy these again.  They work great and are convenient.  I have the 3 plugged up in different places so that my family can just plug in whenever.  Whoever came up with this idea is a genius.
1.0 out of 5 stars;8 hours for 15% charge;I do NOT understand how this product has 4 stars overall. IT TAKES 8 HOURS TO CHARGE 15%! If your lucky!The cords are nice, and seem durable. The connector pieces are relatively low profile, got stuck on my phone case when putting it in. The magnets are strong and can hold phone by the cord and remain attached. The cord will magnetic to anything, Not just the connectors. I had a connector on my samsungs earbuds case and the cord will stick to case. Which seems like it could cause damage, tho none was caused in the short time I had it connected.My biggest issue with these charger cables is that they do not charge. Not in a reasonable amount of time anyway. Plugged my phone in at 68% went to bed woke up 8 and half hours later it was up to 82%. Potatoes could charge my phone faster, so long as I don't use these cables to do it.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Heads keep breaking;I've ordered two sets of these, and I have 4 broken iPhone lightning heads.  I love the concept, but not sure what to do about the heads breaking so much... I'll add pictures later.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charge;Nice cords just charge very slowly. The cord couldn’t charge my iPhone 12pro to 100% overnight and left me with 80%
4.0 out of 5 stars;new charger;everything .....
1.0 out of 5 stars;Hated so bad I need a charge!!!!;This was the worst charger I ever paid money for. The little piece would not stay hooked to the cord. So I had to look for new charger cords. I wouldn’t tell anyone to buy these cords at all
1.0 out of 5 stars;No charging tips included;No charging tips at all included with my order. Highly disappointed
1.0 out of 5 stars;Don’t waste your money;Didn’t last a month when they stopped charging my phone
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great for some devices and uses-not for everyone;I bought this primarily for my daughter. She has a couple conditions that make plugging in cables and other fine motor skills a challenge. Normally we go through regular cords every 2-3 months as they tend to get folded and pinched near the end getting plugged into devices.This cord is so far (1 week in) working great with her iPad and wireless headphones.Her Google Pixel 3a phone was a mixed bag. It does charge, but slowly. The phone comes standard with a fast charging cable. These magnetic connect cables are slow charging.Lesson 1 - these are great for overnight charging!Lesson 2 - these are not great for a quick charge during the day.Challenge scenario 1 - if you need a quick charge then you have to pull the little magnetic tip out of the device and use a normal tip.(not gonna be good for air travelers)Challenge scenario 2 - the tips that you in the device work best when you put them in and leave them in! If you pull them out, they are small and hard to grab (I am not challenged with fine motor skill tasks) they tend to pop up and out and go flying on the floor.Tip 1 - if they go flying, you can use the cord and it’s magnetic end to pick up the tip without having to bend over or reach under your oven.Lesson 3 - as mentioned in the QA each cord lights up with a blue LED. This helps to know that the cord is getting power. The light cannot be turned off. My daughter is also afraid of the dark and the more light the better for her.Challenge Scenario 3 - I was going to use these myself too, but a persistent LED powered on in my bedroom for a phone is a non starter. I prefer pitch black.Lesson 4 - these are charge only, no data transfer through the magnet. Not much of an issue for us as we do most device data connections via Bluetooth/wifi. But if you need a cable for data (backups or some cars) won’t happen with this.Lesson 5 - the Apple adapter tip only provides power on one side of the tip. The other side of the tip is just plastic. Apple cables come with a double sided tip so that no matter which direction you plug it in, it will work. Not so, with these magnetic tips.Challenge Scenario 4 - if you have an Apple device, you’ll need to plug the tip in(50/50 guess) and then connect the cable to power, then look at your Apple device screen and see if the lightning bolt icon confirms that it is charging. If not, pull the tip out(it goes flying on the floor, pick it up with the magnet cord to avoid vending over) and then make a new 50/50 guess if you forgot to pay attention as to how you plugged it in last time and try again.Tip 2 - when you plug in the 1 way tip for an Apple device, pay attention so you won’t have to repeat challenge scenario 4 too many times!Challenge Scenario 5 - these come with an assortment of tips that may or may not be enough for your various types of devices. It was enough for us, since we had 3 different devices. Might not have been enough if we had had 4 of the same device or something.Tip 3 - it’s an inexpensive price for 4 chords, if all the lessons and challenges and tips work for you, maybe buy an extra set. I suspect over time, we will need replacement tips due to losing them when they go flying. Again, best if put in and left in and charged overnight by people who like or do it mind led lights or Taping up led lights.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Awesome at first but they get weak quickly.;I love these and have been using them fir over a year now. Have had to replace the little magnetic fittings that go in the phones charge port regularly though. Im not sure what causes this but after a few weeks my phone no longer fast charges with them. I put in a new one and it works fine for another week or 2.
4.0 out of 5 stars;It’s ok;It does what it’s supposed to do. The charging is very slow and the magnet disconnects very easily. But it works so I guess that’s good.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great buy;These are great. I don't have to worry about anyone stealing my charger because they don't have the pieces to it and no one knows what to do with it. I love it
3.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charge;The light is bright I like how I can find it easy in the dark but my phone sais charges slow with this cord
4.0 out of 5 stars;Not the fastest charging.;I like the selection of fittings and the ease of use. I'd like it to be quicker charging.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Phone says Slow charging;It says Slow charge 🙄
3.0 out of 5 stars;Charging is slowing its own but if you have a good fast charging block? /;Slow charging can be rctified using fast charging block.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Don't buy,  my phone dies on the charger;The charging power is weak. My phone dies on the charger in my car
1.0 out of 5 stars;wouldn't charge my iPhone 7;Very disappointed and returned for credit to my account. it wouldn't charge either my iPhone 7 or my iPad.
5.0 out of 5 stars;So easy!;Love these. Can practically just throw the cord at my phone and it connects - almost. Had to buy extra Micro USB connectors because that's what I need for most of my devices.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Poor quality;The adapters fell apart within a couple of weeks of having these cords. Not worth buying.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Cool cord;It’s a nice cord.. The only problem is it doesn’t work with Apple Car Play
2.0 out of 5 stars;Charges quickly, overheats;I received on time.  The charging time is short, but the devices get VERY  hot during the charging.  Would not leave unattended while charging.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charge;Not fast charge . But otherwise decent cable. Tje iphone insert caused a phome to discharge
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not worth the price;If your phone is on a protective case it will not work properly as the magnetic plug you attach to the charging port on the phone is too big.  So do you want to protect the phone from breaking or the convenience this cable provide.  Additionally if you charge your phone in multiple locations you will need to replace all cords with this one.  Also the magnet disconnected easily when you are changing from portrait to landscape.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Was absolutely hyped about these but;What a great way to charge any electric. Along with the difference attachments however pretty disappointed one of the 6 ft cables right out of the box didn't work at all. The others work just fine. All but one because my phone displays a slow charging warning that reads 12 hour until full charge and even that he actually never raises the battery by a percentage. Otherwise I'd give it 5 stars
5.0 out of 5 stars;Arthritis? No problem!;Perfect my husband had arthritic hands and makes it very hard for him to plug in his phones this was the perfect solution! I will be ordering more
2.0 out of 5 stars;Great cords, when they worked!;The length of the cords great. Short is perfect for things that can be left on the table over night, medium is great for kids bulky tablets and long is perfect to reach bed with extra length. Cords are durable, magnetic connection is decent. The charging power started off strong but now it takes WAY TOO LONG for a decent charge. We've tried old chargers and they work great. But then when we connect with this charger we now get a slow charge warning or a ridiculous amount of hours until charging complete. Could be a great product - if it charged correctly.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Short Life;Used one cord three times, and then it died.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn’t play nice with charging case;If you leave the adapter in a charging case it won’t allow you to charge your phone using charging case. Had to take adapter piece out. So far so good
2.0 out of 5 stars;One of the cables already broke!;These are really simple and quick to use but one already broke off the cord. Sad as this was a gift to my son from Christmas less than two weeks.  Charging cord and length are good but fell apart. See picture.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Returned;Wouldn’t work with a phone case on phone. Plug wouldn’t go all the way in to make connection. Returned
2.0 out of 5 stars;Just okay;Meh. These were okay. I liked the idea of them but hate how easily the cord comes off with a tug. The quality of the pieces themselves were great, I think they just don’t work for me. Will not buy this style of charger again
2.0 out of 5 stars;I’m going to keep them, but they are more on the cheap end of manufacturing.;"The media could not be loaded.
                



 The magnets are decent. The cords are somewhat flimsy. The iPhone chargers only work on one side of being plugged in. The only reason it’s worth the price, is the amount of cords and replacement heads you get.Edit- it’s been about a month and I ended up returning them, they are such bad quality. I have the HYDOOD cords now and they work so so so much better."
5.0 out of 5 stars;Would definitely buy again!;Absolutely perfect!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Short Durability;Charging power is too slow. The cord lost magnet.
3.0 out of 5 stars;great idea,  slow charge;I like the idea of it.. it just charges slow..
3.0 out of 5 stars;Magnet on adaptor breaks off easy.;I love this magnetic concept. I bought these because I have 4 kids and 3 of them very young. I got tired of them ripping their kindle fire kids edition tablets off their chargers. It always destroyed the micro USB end of the chargers. I got these and they work really well but the magnetic button on the adapters that go on the devices breaks off easily. So the adapter is still in the device but you see a round top with the computer chip that was soldered to the other side of the button. They've already broken 2 in the 5 days we've had them. Good thing they sent extras. But it will not be long until we dont have any. I did like how they sent a variety of micro, micro-c, and iphone style adaptors.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Satisfied at the beginning but...;I love these at the beggining and didn't have any issues but after a few weeks the little part that was attached to the phone fell apart. After that pretty much all of the ones I was using started to do the same. So nice concept but  not durable.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Very good chargers!;Works just as it should. The magnet isn't strong enough to carry my phone like some people want it too. But also my phone case is a little heavy. But I love all of these chargers. Even the short ones are very useful for how I have my home set up.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Unforeseen issue;Doesn’t work for my iPhone because my phone case... my case isn’t that large in fact this seems to be more of an oversight by the products design.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good but...;Ok...the product idea is awesome! I love this charger, HOWEVER...the little connectors break too easily. I had one while it was in my phone, and when I gently disconnected the magnet, it SEPARATED the CONNECTOR PIECE! (See image). Then, the piece got STUCK in my PHONE! Luckily, I was able to use pliers to pull it out. That was my LAST ONE too, so I had to order more.I do wish that the iPhone connector was able to connect both ways and that they could transmit data (for syncing to the computer), but it does disclose that it doesn’t do that, so I can’t fault them for that. All-in-all, it does FUNCTION well, but the quality just needs to improve a bit.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped working;They first box i received was missing a cable.  Got a replacement quickly. After a week the cables stopped lighting up and would not charge. The attachments to the tablet would fall out and also stop working.  Loved the concept made things so much easier when they worked.
3.0 out of 5 stars;It IS BRIGHT.  Too much so.;The magnetic connection is strong. The connectors work well with my phone. The blue light is overwhelming and not at all subtle.  Having a cord in my bedroom glowing blue is not what I had in mind.Sometimes my phone says the connection is slow and so I try to clean the connectors.Seems fine thereafter.  ( the small bud connector is constantly on my phone, so, of course, it's going to get a little dirty being put in my pocket, or sat down on tables or whatever.)This is my second set of a different kind of magnetic phone charger. And I like this one better. Except for the bright blue light.
5.0 out of 5 stars;100% satisfied;Product accuracy as described on site, fast shipping, very good product.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Way too bright;The light on these chargers is ridiculous. Lights up the whole room almost when plugged in. Would not recommend for the sheer fact the cable port lights up like the northern star
4.0 out of 5 stars;Worth it;Great
5.0 out of 5 stars;So cool;Works awesome
3.0 out of 5 stars;magnet connection weak;Takes a longer than normal time to charge. The magnetic connection is very weak and easily detached without notice. You almost have to hold the phone and the charger while it charges. Even laying on a table can detach the cord and you assume it is charging when it is not. Otherwise it is a great concept, but the execution is poor.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Does not work.;Junk.  Doesn't even charge.  Phone sat on charge for over an hour and battery percentage never went up.
5.0 out of 5 stars;I love these!!!;I cannot say enough good things about these! I have them everywhere around my house. I've put one in all my cars, I even put them in my son's cars. I love them so much I've started giving them as gifts. The charging port can break from all the wear and tear and with these you won't have that problem.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Very good cords;Does not support cable chompers since the weight at the end is enough to knock the balance off and disconnect it, but I think that's a small price to pay for such fast charging and ease of connection. (I just slid my cable chomper to the other end so that it could still look cute without messing up the balance.)
4.0 out of 5 stars;Fast charging;Connects to the phone without much effort and lighted end makes it easy to locate even in the dark
3.0 out of 5 stars;Will not project to screen in car;I didn’t have this long enough to give it a full review. What I can tell you is I bought this to use in my car as I am a delivery driver and have to plug and unplug my phone all the time. I wanted it to project onto  my audio/visual screen in my car for gps reasons and with this cord it will not do that. So for me it did not serve it’s purpose. I rated at a 3 because my knowledge is only of that and that there was good cord lengths and many tips.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Takes too long to charge;Cord lengths are great and ideas good but does not work with fast charger which I didn't realize when I bought it
2.0 out of 5 stars;Just did not stand up to the wild raves about it;Each one of the cables lasted about 5-7 days the ends that attached to the phone lost its charging pin and the protection around it melted so durability turned out to be non existent.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Missing change;1 missing 6ft charger
5.0 out of 5 stars;"Coolest things I've bought in a long time; Just Amazing!!";"First off, I don't normally write reviews unless the product is ""Amazing"", and I did NOT get anything from anyone to write this review.So, I felt like I just had to tell you that these charging cables and magnetic plug sets are Truly Amazing. the coolest things I've bought in awhile!  I put the cables in all the places I need to charge things (my office, workroom, camper, and one of those 'power bricks'), then I put the plug ends into all the devices I need to charge (android phone, iPhone, kindle, bt speaker, earbuds, 'power brick', vape, and hiking gps).There are four(!!) plug ends for each of the three plug types(USB C, micro usb, and lightning), so I have more than enough (12 plugs total) for every device I have.  If you need more than 4 plugs of the same type, for $10 you can get 5 more ($2 each).The magnets that hold the cables to the plugs are strong and stable, yet they rotate freely and still keep the connection.  I can basically 'wave' the cable over the device, and it snaps on.  Just Amazing.  They are so strong that I can actually hang the devices (not the brick) from the cables.  So if your phone falls off the nightstand, no worries, it will still be connected.  Maybe hanging there, but still charging.The cable end has a blue light that's always on, so you can easily find the cable in complete darkness.  I just wave the bottom of the phone at the blue light, and it connects itself.  So. Very. Amazing.  I wish I had bought these years ago!!"
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great purchase;I bought this because I needed a plug to keep charging port clean, as I recently went to get that fixed. They cleaned port and charges fine. So this is a two in one purchase, since port will stay clean, magnetic link is rapid charging, and very easy to connect and disconnect. Actually ended up buying a second one to share since it has four cords and multiple styles of plugs.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Really not good;DONT waste your money
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good product however there is some quality control issues.;Overall this is a good product however one of the four cords magnet was installed in reverse causing the cord to actually repel the adapter. If this was a solo pack I would be a little more salty however the other 3 work great. Good choice for video game controllers but be aware of QC issues.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works very fast;Love these chargers.. gave my whole family one as well.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good for the price;Like de 6ft cable and the charging power is ok
3.0 out of 5 stars;The magnetic head charging cables are not for high Amps devices like S10+ or S20+;Been lured even myself into believing that I need a higher power charger, where as in fact, it's the so called magnetic cable technology that absolutely does not work for high Amps devices (like Galaxy S10+ and S20+). It's a universal manufacturer and vendor conspiracy - and this product is just one of them. They all know that's impossible to safely pass a high electric current through wires and contacts that thin and tiny and avoid any fire hazard. However, to save their business. all of them deliberately hide the truth to mislead their potential customers. I still have to find *one* that doesn't do that! To add to this dangerous general public confusion, the magnetic cables still work with some less demanding devices. Just so you know.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Worked great with my s8;Had an s8 for years and the charger port went out in the final 8 months I used this product. Upgraded to the S22 Ultra that this product unfortunately does not fast charge. Still a good purchase simply because the ends can stay inside whatever you need to charge and you only need one cord to charge most things.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not if you work around metal;These seem like a great idea, but I'm a mechanic and welder so I'm constantly covered in metal shavings. The moment I put one in my pocket, it became covered in metal shavings. Theres no way to easily clean it and I'm afraid of it shorting out so I'm sending them back. Otherwise, they looked like nice cables and if you arent surrounded by metal dust you might have better luck.
4.0 out of 5 stars;No fast charge;Cables are good but didn't read it fully it doesn't fast charge my Note 20 ultra the reason I only left 4 stars not sure why it doesn't though if I use my original power supply with a usb to c converter
2.0 out of 5 stars;I would look for a better product!!;this is a joke... the cables build quality is okay, like the charging light indicator. but their performance is so pathetic...the shortest cable the 1ft  is drawing 10W, the 3 ft one is 5W and the current draw on the 6ft is at 3W.... wtf....my charger is capable of outputting 60W and my phone can take 45W... these cables are epitome of bottlenecks.  only great to charge smaller accessories and if using for phone then its overnight slow charging. these cables cannot even kick start a dead Note 10Plus at these charge speeds. save your money. and also instead of supplying all the cables as USB A to magnetic they could have included a type C to Magnetic cable too...most of the new chargers are comming with type ports...
5.0 out of 5 stars;Does not wear out my plugging in devices;Fast charging, convenience one hand operating. Supplying magnetic charges to all types of devices. Excellent!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Small to finger in place;They seem to work but the magnets are not strong enough to lift it up. That’s a good thing
5.0 out of 5 stars;Best thing I ever bought!;I love, love this charger set.  I was able to get rid of so many chargers by adapting them all with the metal pins. My iPhone, speakers, watch. Same cord anytime.  Love!!
2.0 out of 5 stars;I can't quick charge anything.;This connector does not deliver all of the current to the connected device. None of my devices will quick charge using the connector and cable provided. It's a great concept, but it's disappointing in practice. I suppose it's great if all you have to charge are things with a micro-USB connector: the cables are lighted and the connector just pops onto the adapter on the device. So that's something.
4.0 out of 5 stars;I am buying MORE!!!;Finally!!! I have 5 kids and we go through charging cords like you wouldn’t believe.We now have all the adapters in our phones, tablets, wireless headphones, everything! We have the cords strategically placed everywhere throughout the house and I couldn’t be more pleased and satisfied with the product. I am actually going to buy more cords because I want to put some in my car also! I wish this existed 10 years ago!!Edit 6.19.20Okay after having it for a couple weeks I am starting to see some cons of this item. Don’t get me wrong, this product is awesome BUT it’s not always “case” friendly. I have iphone cases and ipad cases where the adaptor won’t fit because the magnetic connecter is round instead of oval. If the charging opening of the case is made of rubber you can squeeze the adapter in, if it’s plastic, good luck trying to finaggle that adapter in there.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Works for charging only;These adapters have only 2 points of contact so there is no data transfer allowed. The 2 points also limit the amount of current for your device which may not quick charge. The contacts are also protruding past the edge which could cause a short circuit if the magnet attracts anything metal.I ended up ordering a different version with 4 points of contact for data transfer and more current. These adapters were used for things like flashlights and other types of non-smart devices.
1.0 out of 5 stars;the connection is not good, phone only charges 1-4 times connected.;product does not connect power correctly to I phone consistently. frustrating
5.0 out of 5 stars;Must have;These are awesome. Where have they been all my life. I know it says charging cords but I missed that part. They do not exchange data but otherwise love em. Connection is strong. Charges well.
5.0 out of 5 stars;These are legit;This set is pretty solid. Wish I could get 12 tips of any type rather than some I don’t need but I love these things.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good product;Great for kids so they don’t break tip off the chargers in the ipad or a phone had that couple time
5.0 out of 5 stars;One of the best purchases ever!;I wasn't sure how well this would work. It looked gimmicky at first but decided to give it a shot. I'm glad I did. It's so nice being able to use the same cord to charge my android, wife's iPhone, Xbox controller, turtle beach headphones, and more! Saves us so much time and space using one cord for all these devices!I will definitely stick with these cables!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Do not buy these if...;You have a device that supports fast charging. The magnet connector is strong enough to attach to your device, but it can still disconnect if you're not careful. Also, if the USB Port on your device is well overused, the magnetic USB connector can fall out when you least expect it, so be weary of that.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not great;One of the 6ft cables is temperamental and sometimes needs reconnected to enable charging
3.0 out of 5 stars;Conveinant but not as good as proper cable. iPhone;Love the magnetic connection in the car or beside my bed. So easy to pass the iPhone or iPad near the cable and it just clicks on.Unfortunately, when using the connection to the computer it will not connect to iTunes which is a major problem as I have to pull the tiny adaptor out and change to an original cable and then there is a chance of losing the tiny adaptor.The blue light is a real pain!. So bright in the bedroom or car. I ended up having to put electrical tape over all the cables to reduce the light source.My iPhone had to be rebooted a couple of times as I got an error message about the cable.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Poor;Magnet kept coming out of device when cable pulled away.  Also didn’t charge when connectedThese wasn’t cheap and not fit for purpose
5.0 out of 5 stars;Awesome;The cables worked brilliantly the only disadvantage is it charges a little bit slower but for peace of mind of not breaking cables it's brilliant highly recommended
1.0 out of 5 stars;Disappointing;2 of the attachements did not work and can not cantact seller
3.0 out of 5 stars;Usable but not Great!;It works on most of the devices except on our iPhones.  The magnetic is definitely not strong enough to stay connected unless on a flat surface and the device is stable on the table or something.  If I would buy again, I would try some other brands.
2.0 out of 5 stars;It works... the magnet is good.;Don't expect to charge devices like your phone or ipad with these, just to charge my S20 Ultra takes about 4 & 1/2 hours. Is good for like Samsung buds or for my mini usb powered fan.
3.0 out of 5 stars;So so;Great idea with magnetic charger, however 2 out of 4 charging cables already not working or work intermittent. Will look for more durable ones
4.0 out of 5 stars;Reliable Usage;You can never have to many chargers laying around and these are perfect not too short and not to long just right
5.0 out of 5 stars;Double bang for your buck.;This is the perfect solution for me as my others wore out. Heavy duty. Long but not too long cords. Adaptors plug-in securely and fast charge. Did I say you get two comple chargers for a great price?! The pouch they came in is great too.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works great!;Charges really fast and the long cord is a plus.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Excellent product;This is durable and does exactly what it says, fast (Samsung very fast) charge
4.0 out of 5 stars;****;Decent charger cables just so so.
4.0 out of 5 stars;So far it works good, I like it.;So far, so good!
4.0 out of 5 stars;They work for less then a month;"They no longer charge ""fast"" both charger take hours to even get your phone to turn on. So dissatisfied."
3.0 out of 5 stars;Highly recommended. Best super charger ever own;I highly recommend this product This is by far the best faster super charger I ever owned. I bought my first pair of these last summer. It will completely charge a cell phone with 10 % power left in less then 30 minutes. They worked so well I bought another pair for my kids.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging;Does not charge fast at all
4.0 out of 5 stars;It's ok;It's OK
3.0 out of 5 stars;Just an ordinary charger;I was looking for a fast charger and this is not it.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Only 1 worked, but did work well;Unfortunately, only one cord worked. And that one works really, really well. Hoping to get the second replaced, but overall very worth the buy
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast;"Advertised as fast charging system. I didn't see any improvement over an old regular charger I was using. It take just as long to charge and the phone says ""slow charging"" when this brick and cable is plugged into the phone."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Second chances;The first one I got stopped working too soon but it really did charge very quickly so I decided to try again.
4.0 out of 5 stars;So far so good;Dose it's job and all I need it to do
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great purchase, great value, and highly recommend!;Hi Amazonland!I am very happy with my chargers! I have only used one charger so far and will be setting up the other one today to use in another room of my house. I also have not tried out the cords because I purchased 10 foot rapid charging cords prior to making this purchase. I do not use my phone while on the charger but it is useful to have the length because I seem to enjoy moving furniture around in my house and have limited outlets.Anyway, the one rapid charger I have been using works perfectly! I tend to forget to charge my phone overnight (I have a traumatic brain injury that affects my memory) so after I progressed enough to return to and finishing nursing school this wasn't much of an issue since I was always working on school or in clinical. Now I notice that I forget to charge it more frequently so I love being able to charge my phone in a short amount of time! How else am I going to quickly write reviews on Amazon since I'm not on my laptop all the time now! 😂😁Product also shipped fast and arrived on time! I will eventually purchase this deal (it is a deal!) again so I can put one in my purse and have the other in my nursing work/go bag (when I am able to return back to work).
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great buy for inexpensive price;Great buy. I needed a new charger & for the price, this was perfect. The charge is super fast so there's no long wait & the chord is long so it reaches great.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good Item;It was what was expected
3.0 out of 5 stars;Just a backup.;They don't charge fast at all.
3.0 out of 5 stars;2 pack;Good thing they come in a 2 pack, my first one only lasted a month. I'm on my second charger already....
4.0 out of 5 stars;Worth A Try;The first time I product the product it didn't charge that well. But once I requested an exchange the charger works perfectly fine! Charges fast for sure.
2.0 out of 5 stars;SLOW CHARGING;I chose these for the high star rating and they're long enough to reach wherever I'm sitting. They are the SLOWEST charge I've owned if I leave them alone. If I'm doing basic scrolling while it's on the charger, it can't even handle that and I LOSE charge while plugged in. Don't get these.
2.0 out of 5 stars;I rarely write negative reviews;"My first purchase of two chargers included one that charged so slowly my phone with 73% battery said ""25 hours and 35 minutes until full"". Sent those back and got a second set, figuring the first pair being terrible was a fluke. The second set charges fine sometimes, and slow others (I'll actually get a notification telling me ""slow charger, check connection). Overall I think the product is subpar and I wouldn't purchase again."
3.0 out of 5 stars;EHHHHJ;It does it's job, but if you're looking for longevity and durability go with a braided cord. PS keep up out of the way places  my cat loved to chew on the one  even when I thought I cat proofed it ...saved the 2nd one.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Its a good replacement for a phone charger.;My charger I got with my phone quit working and I still have an older phone which is a S8+. It easier to order something online then it is to go to the phone store.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Cheap quality, worked well for a few months;Worked well for a few months, since then began overheating. The cord itself is excellent, but the actual wall plug in charging unit is not very well made, cheap quality that overheats sometimes. Best to buy something more expensive that will last you a long time.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Charges fast;Travelers beware, other charge adapters will charge slowly as indicated on Samsung phones.  This does the job.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great to have these;These are compatible with my Samsung Galaxy.  Charges fast.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Adaptive Fast Type C Android Phone Charger review;I loved the product at first. It does charge fast. Then I noticed it overheats so much that I have to unplug it. It feels like it could catch fire while I sleep. The phone brand charger did not overheat.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Only one works;I have gotten these before. One works great the other is a bust! Can't send both back because it's my only charger. Should I send one back?
3.0 out of 5 stars;Gets hot;Charger will get very hot. Don't leave unattended
3.0 out of 5 stars;Worked ok.;Not quite the same as Samsung original.  A bit slower charging than oem.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Functional, but low quality;It does the job.  Everything about this product seems cheap. It does get very warm during use.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Good seller, charging blocks died;With in the first 2 months, both chargers quit working.  Changed the block on both.chargers.  work okay since I got rid of the blocks they came with.
3.0 out of 5 stars;"The two chargers arrived on time and both worked for a short time; before one quit working.";The chargers both worked on arrival. but one quit on the first use.  Amazon was quick to ship replacement charger.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Pretty fast charging at first;Good value for the price
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good but wire is short;Good but wire is short
2.0 out of 5 stars;wanted these to work...but sadly had to toss;I was excited to receive these chargers. Unfortunately, they plug overheats to the point of becoming too hot to touch. I tried different outlets with no success.  I thought it could be just one of the plugs (it was a set of two), but it ended up being both plugs overheating. To be safe, I just tossed them out so no one would use them.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good chargers!;Extra chargers for the livingroom.
3.0 out of 5 stars;USB Travel Adapter;What I dislike is the fact that the item does not seem to be compatible with my Samsung Fast Charge phone charger. This charger can charge my Samsung Note 10+ and my Samsung Galaxy Active2 watch. however, upon plugging this item into the unit, the charger blinks green lights, then yellow lights, then red lights.  It then continues to blink red lights. Is this normal? If this is not the right adapter, is there one available that will enable me to charge both items? The Model number for my charger is EP-N6100. Please respond at your earliest convenience.  In the meantime, I am unable to charge my watch.
3.0 out of 5 stars;One charger was damaged, the other perfect.;Second time I got this product. Great first time. This time one hums. Will return it.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Barely works;So of the two chargers, one does work. Not super fast but well enough. Can't really use my device while it is charging or it drains. One of the chargers just doesn't work. I tried using an alternative cord with the base and it didn't fit. Would not recommend.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Stop Fast charging within  2 weeks.;Stop doing fast charging.Not working
2.0 out of 5 stars;Wire sheathing brittle and has already cracked at connection;Charges fast and cord length good, just not sufficient flexability.
5.0 out of 5 stars;I will continue to order these!!;Absolutely worth every penny!!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not a very strong or fast;Not a very strong or fast charger.
3.0 out of 5 stars;1 worked 1 didn't no matter sent Both back.;2 came 1 worked 1 didn't had to send both back the 1that did work was fast , sorry.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Faulty block;I've had a terrible time finding chargers that my phone is okay with. I have a Samsung. This was working great and charged so fast. However the first block I pulled out made an awful high pitch squeal when plugged in. Thought it was my nightstand until we tried it in other outlets and it did the same thing. Switched the block for the second one and it works fine. Super upsetting though because I'm afraid the wiring is bad and could start a fire with how loud the squeal is.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Did not last.;Ok at best.Lasted a few weeks.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Pretty good for about five weeks;Both cords stopped working after less than six weeks. Naturally, this happened less than week after the return window closed.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good quality for price;Cords are nice and long!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Basic additional charger;I'm not able to use this charger to plug into my wireless charger.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Charger;It took3 hours to charge my phone.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Very useful phone charger;These are very fast chargers... The only complaint for me is I wish the cord was longer
5.0 out of 5 stars;Worked great.;My phone charger was not charging well any more... got a code notice.  New chargers were reasonably priced and work well.
4.0 out of 5 stars;They get to hot.;They work good, I just worry because they get very hot. So I charge my cell phone 45 or 50 mins and unplug. Just in case...
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great product;I have used these charhers 4 a long while they give me great bang 4 my buck.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Weak travel charger;There is nothing fast about this charger. It is a weak level travel style charger. Planning to return it.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works great no problems at all;Works great
5.0 out of 5 stars;Excellent product.;Fast shipping, excellent product. Would definitely buy from this seller again.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Does not last;The cable was good for about 5 months. Price is right but don't expect it to last long.
3.0 out of 5 stars;One already stopped working;One of the chargers started making a weird noise when plugged in then completely stopped working.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Having extra always helps;I always like to have extra when traveling and so easy to pack, of course.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great in a pinch;I wish the cord was a little longer but other than that, it's great.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Worst charger I have had;Why does this charger take 13 hour 38 minutes to charge phone when other charger takes 2 hours 30 min? I can't be bothered to find out! Please learn from my mistake... do NOT order these products!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Super fast charging;It does what it says it supposed to do, which is charge my Samsung phones fast and low battery.
2.0 out of 5 stars;For it to work longer than 41/2 months.;I purchased them on March 26 2022. It worked great for a while and now it doesn't work.I'm very disappointed.Thank you,Nancy Blauvelt
2.0 out of 5 stars;The performance;These chargers charged fast but one made a noise while charging and the other one broke at one end when plugged into phone.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Only one was a fast charger.;Only one charger was a fast charger.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Product update after a year;I purchased this on January 30, 2022. BOTH chargers have died on me in the same timeframe.I initially suspected my battery, which has been replaced. The first charger took 3 hours to charge to max and second charger took 5 hours.I tested with the original charger my phone came with and it works fine.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not Viable for Long-Term Use;One of them just didn't work at all. The other worked fine, but it only worked for a month before it just stopped charging altogether. It's very frustrating. I wasn't even careless with the cables. They are just that poorly made.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Verty Fast Charge;Pro: Very Fast ChargeCon: short cord - it's 4ft prefer a 6ftHope it lasts - my cords tend to fray after so long. But looks like it will last. Good purchase.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Base is way too hot in the outlet;One of the chargers wouldn't work and was getting really hot in the outlet within a month of use.  Tried a different outlet. Same issue.  Charger would switch from no charge,  regular charger,  and fast charge and overworking
1.0 out of 5 stars;Wears out fast;After 3 months neither cord will fast charge, and one doesn't charge at all. No damage to either cord
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good chargers;These work great. I have to keep buying them because my son keeps losing them. But as long as he keeps losing them, I'll continue to buy these as they are great.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't fit my Android;The small end to connect to my Android is too big.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Cheap quality.;Kinda flimsy. Cheap quality.  Sometimes doesn't work.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Very affordable and fast shipping;I have bought several of these, they work fast and come in a nice carry package. Thank you!
1.0 out of 5 stars;don't last;we had these chargers for less than 3 months and they no longer charge a phone.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped fast charging after a month;I saw a lot of reviews mentioning that the cords lose fast charging capabilities and they were right because I experienced the same thing. Fast charged for the first month, from 15% power it would take about 1 hr 45 min to full charge, now it takes about 4 hours to get a full charge from 15%. I am using this cord with my Galaxy S8+. I don't think it is my phone causing the problem since it still fast charges with the cord that came with the phone and with another fast charge cord I got at Target.I still gave them 2 stars instead of 1 because technically the cords still work for charging, they just don't charge fast like advertised. Might be worth it to pay a little more money for an actual fast charge cord that will last longer.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Plugs overheated;When charging the boxes that goes into the wall starts to overheat quickly,when charging phone . Had to unplug, not one but both of them. Phone came on thankfully and gave a warning bad charge connection. Not worth the money.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works great for Samsung 8;Works great
5.0 out of 5 stars;Working good so far;Seems to be exactly as indicated on the website and seems to be working good.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Replacement charger;These were just like the original ones. I am so glad that I was able to get them.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Charging;Low cost and functional
3.0 out of 5 stars;One out of the 4 I ordered doesn't work.;Bought 4. 3 work great. 1 doesn't work.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great chargers;They are quicker than most but not as fast as I would have thought. But still a great buy and worth it.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Charges to 100% in an hour! Love it!!!;This charges my phone to 100% in literally 1 hour. Before I would have my phone charging for hours to get my battery charged to 100%This is absolutely a must have and for the price.... it's a win win!
5.0 out of 5 stars;phone chargers;These chargers look so simple, but work great!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Hit or miss , mine over heats;1 charger works fine. Charges pretty quickly.  The other quickly over heats and gets very hot to the touch and takes longer to charge...
2.0 out of 5 stars;Buying this product is an easy way short out your device;"This product is one of the few at this price point that actually delivers on  fast charging charging speed and capabilities. However, it is wired so cheaply that right out of the box it has all the components of a safety hazard.THIS PRODUCT MIGHT RUIN YOUR DEVICE.I've tested all off the charging blocks and cables and have found that while the product is technically durable, any angling or positioning it doesnt agree with will cause it to send inconsistent power to your device. Effectively ""unplugging"" itself every half second or so. This can be extremely detrimental to the battery of whatever you are charging as well as the device itself especially if it doesn't have proper electric protections that dampen the effect of this behavior.Would not recommend."
3.0 out of 5 stars;Be careful;"The charging tips both broke in about 2 weeks.  I didn't think we were ""tough"" on them at all."
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works great!;Longer cord than the one that came with my Samsung SE10 which is nice! Charges just as fast as the one that came with the phone as well. Great value for great price!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Very thin cords!;Hope they hold up, they are not as thick as standard cords.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Usable in one spot!;The only dislike is that cords are NOT long enough.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Too short.  Not long enough;I like but it was too short.  What was it 3feet?
1.0 out of 5 stars;Slowest charger I've ever owned.;Plugged it in all night and still not 100% charged.
1.0 out of 5 stars;One didn't work update;Got these the other day. One worked fine the other would stop charging. Something wrong with the cord. Needed two for my husband and I can have our own charger.Now have to go buy another one. So dissatisfied with this charger.Update on these. My other charger that was working started smoking when I plugged it in. I have never seen that happen with a charger. Im glad my phone is ok. Don't buy this charger. Wasted my money. ☹😡🤬
5.0 out of 5 stars;Durable and quick charging.;Work as advertised.  Fast charge is what I like best.  Will definitely purchase again if needed but I think these will last a long time because of durability.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Chargers work briefly;"Both of the chargers initially fast charge the cell phone. however, the fast charge is very brief. The 2 chargers that I have had approximately 1 month no longer fast charge.  There is a message that comes up when plugged to the cell phone, ""make sure the cable or charger are properly connected."" I didn't know I would need to purchase 2 per month.  The convenience was short lived."
4.0 out of 5 stars;fast charger;these worked great  as fast as orignal even better  have a spare in case you misplace one
4.0 out of 5 stars;Worked as expected;Charger charged Samsung 10s+ FAST. WANTED EXTRA for traveling, looks and works same as the one that came with phone.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Did not last;These started out okay, but less than 2 months and now my phone is losing battery percent while plugged in.  I get a message telling me to check that the cable and charger are properly connected (they are).  My status says it will be fully charged in 26 hours.  Don't waste your money.
1.0 out of 5 stars;After 2 months of use, this product is no longer working properly.  Very disappointed.;Durability? Forget it. The connecting power-giving part of the charger no longer stays plugged in.
5.0 out of 5 stars;It come on time;I ready like the item, yes I did used the item
1.0 out of 5 stars;Save your money;The block gets hot. The cord stopped working.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Did NOT fast charge my Samsung Note 10;My phone died so I tried out my new charger.  When I first plugged it in, all I saw was the lightning symbol with no indication of how long it would take.  I checked it every half hour or so, and every time I checked, it was no where near done.  I left it plugged in for over two and a half hours.  By that time it was on 77% and said it still needed over 40 minutes.  I didn't want to leave it plugged in all night so I gave up and unplugged it.  On the bright side, nothing was overheating.  I'm returning it and trying another one from somewhere else.
1.0 out of 5 stars;They are not durable;"Within five months both of the adapters had cracked on the plastic insert into the phone. Now everytime I plug them in I receive a message to ""use the charger which came with the phone and make sure the cable isn't damaged."" It takes SIX to TEN  times as long to charge."
1.0 out of 5 stars;Almost caught on fire!;Bought these and after a few uses my phone started making the noise as if I was just plugging it in to charge it..it was making it every couple minutes. I unplugged the charger from the wall and it was super hot. I tried it at my work, same thing. I tried other locations and outlets and it kept doing it. I wanted to make sure it wasn't the electric in my home. The charger would become extremely hot and then tonight it smelled like it was burning. I immediately threw it away after I could smell burning. DO NOT BUY!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Low quality that doesn’t charge with a case on it;Low quality that doesn’t charge with a case on it .
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great charger;Works great! Charges fast. The cord on my son's started to come apart at the base, but still great for the price. Would definitely buy it again.

3.0 out of 5 stars;Regular chargers;Not fast charging...
4.0 out of 5 stars;Need it to perform.;Cell phone
2.0 out of 5 stars;Nothing fast about it!;It takes forever to charge. I thought about sending it back but this Galaxy S10 plus phone is hard to find a charger to fit. I bought some from Amazon a while back and they work fine.  They don't claim to be fast charging.  Shirley
2.0 out of 5 stars;Use the phones charger only.;I think the product could be good but my phone did not like it.  I kept getting the message to use the charger that's made for my phone.  It overheated my phone and when unplugged, the metal of the charger was so hot it burned me.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Don't;These chargers didn't even last 2 weeks. The first one actually melted the port off my son's phone and almost started a fire.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Save your money.;Like many other reviews have stated, it doesn't seem to offer fast charging. The phone gets really hot and it barely moves the battery power. Mine has been sitting at 65% for a whole day.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Work Great;Needed quick charging cord for my Samsung Note 8 -- this works great -- charges quickly
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great for the price;Love them
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great product;Very good quality product, does the job, & charges my phone really fast!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Does not work - AVOID;I guess you get what you pay for, thought this was a good deal but hard PASS. I have a samsung s10e with quick charging, when I first plugged in the charger into the phone I had about 65% battery and it said it would take 3.5hr to charge and got a message from my phone saying the charging was much slower than anticipated. When enabled quick charge on the phone, it appeared to work as the phone said quick cable charging and 42 minutes left, however 5 minutes later it still said 42 minutes and an hour later the phone had barely charged. I tried both chargers, both cables. Don't know if the charger or the cables are to blame but doesn't matter I quickly send this back to get refunded and purchased a new quick charger and cables from known brands.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Fits phone;Correct cord for a s9 and charged fast.

5.0 out of 5 stars;Fast charger, love it;Great charger
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not as advertised.;Both cords work to charge my Galaxy S10e but they certainly are not fast chargers. A message pops up every time I plug my phone in telling me to use my factory cord for best performance. Charge time with these cords is at least double my OE Samsung cord. If your not worried about speed these chargers work fine but if you want to fast charge look elsewhere.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great price;I liked the price of the product & fast delivery .  I needed extra charging cables & chargers.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Fast charge;Cable work but the adapters dont, i have to use different adapters
5.0 out of 5 stars;5 Stars;Great value
2.0 out of 5 stars;Scared to use these;When I plugged them in they make a buzzing sound. I am so afraid to use them.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Trash;"We forgot we ordered these back in July and just found them. Took them out of the package and the ""adaptive fast charging"" takes 38 hr 16 min to charge a phone. I took the USB cables and attached them to old plugs we had and they work fine (2hr to charge). It's the plug part that is garbage. Very disappointing."
1.0 out of 5 stars;Junk;Purchased these and it's outside of reund and they stopped working! How convenient.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Charger;Charger does consistently charge
1.0 out of 5 stars;This charger looks like the original Samsung charger but it is TRASH;First day or two it worked fine, then one of them stopped working completely and the other take 9hrs to charge from 5% on my s10+. I thought it might be just the power brick but no, the wire is trash too. I plugged it into my original Samsung power brick in it still said 6hrs from 4%. I would recommend to not purchase this item. Go to you local cellphone service provider and buy a OE Samsung charger. Literally a waste of money because I am not going to spend my time returning a 12 dollar item. In the trash can it goes.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Dangerous;Both of the chargers emit a buzzing/whining sound and they get very hot while charging. Fire hazard?
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not very durable;Great product worked as intended for about a few months but unfortunately both chargers have malfunction before the original charger that came with my device. Not sure whether the product is from the same supplier but didn't last long at all. Giving 2 stars instead of 1 as i might have possible gotten 2 defected ones but still doesn't excuse for this ordeal.
1.0 out of 5 stars;One of the charging plug adapters doesn't work;One of the charging plug adapters doesn't work, it just gets hot.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great Buy;Great quality long cords, does the job
5.0 out of 5 stars;Its fast charger and cheap;I like it, it's like the real charger!!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast @ all;No fast charging with this charger price was cheap probly why
2.0 out of 5 stars;Don't waste your money;I've used them for less than a month already falling apart
1.0 out of 5 stars;Charger ports are on fire!!;Do NOT recommend. After first charge the charger head was so hot I thought the plastic was going to melt through. Poor quality. Fast charging is not even fast. Takes too long to charge, over 5 hours. Probably why the charger overheated.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Make sure items work before you send them.;One of the chargers did not work.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Few months outta each charger;Dont last long
1.0 out of 5 stars;One works one doesn't;Disappointed. It's like when you buy a pint of strawberries the rotten ones are hidden. Bought 2 charges in a pack. One works one doesn't. I can't tell you how many times I've dealt with this. Pretty tired of them shipping the failed one with a functional one.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Stop working after using maybe twice.;Doesn't work
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great product. Super fast shipping.;Awesome! Thanks!
2.0 out of 5 stars;It is not fast charging like it says;The charger was not a fast charger like it says

2.0 out of 5 stars;False advertising;Closer to 2.5 watts than 10 watts
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works great;Great product and price
1.0 out of 5 stars;Slowest charger ever;I bought a fast charger for my Samsung Galaxy 10e. After testing it in several different outlets, it just doesn't charge. When I plug it in, it will give an approximate time till full charge.  It said a full charge would be reached in 51 minutes. It charged about 10% in those 51 minutes. I tried several different times with the same result. The fast charger that came with my phone does what it says it will do. I am returning this order and trying a different charger.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Worst purchase;These take an hour to even charge to 5 percent waste of money very poor not worth purchasing
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good charger;Goood product the galaxy 8s
2.0 out of 5 stars;One plug malfunctioned right away;One of my chargers broke right away during the night. Luckily I had a back up from the previous phones with the same specs and the cord they sent works.  Other one is fine for now, who know's how long it will last.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not good at all didnt work on my Note 9.;These were not Samsung chargers.  These were very flimsy the word very thin even for the price I paid. I still at least gave these a try and no suprise that the they dont work. I woke up with a 10% battery.  I have ordered a few chargers and comparison these were the worst.  I'm going to order the last ones I bought on here.  Im not going to bother to send these back but they are both going in the trash.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Make sure the product work;Not happy with this product had to return the first one I bought it was defeated
3.0 out of 5 stars;Slow;Slow
5.0 out of 5 stars;Fast charging;The fast changing works
1.0 out of 5 stars;DO NOT BUY.  One melted and almost caused a fire.  The other one lasted two weeks.;VERY DANGEROUS.  POORLY MADE.  Lasted less than two months.  One only lasted a week.
1.0 out of 5 stars;No good;Definitely not a fast charging charger takes 6 hours to fully charge my phone. Not worth buying unless you charge youd phone when you sleep
2.0 out of 5 stars;Slow Chargers/ Expected Better;These were advertised as fast chargers and they are not. Quite disappointed.Update: Have a Samsung Galaxy 8+. Would not charge unless I held it in place. Was unable to charge while using phone.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not quite sure...;I don't think I ever had a slower charger. I was at  32% and it said it would take 24 hrs to charge to full....
2.0 out of 5 stars;Melted;Charging blocks actually overheated and melted.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Did not fit;Did not fit
2.0 out of 5 stars;Only one charger worked!;Received the item within 2 days. One of the two chargers actually work. The second of the two has a shortage and I just used took it out of the pack!
2.0 out of 5 stars;They don't work;They suck
1.0 out of 5 stars;Junk;"3 weeks and it was no longer ""fast charging"""
1.0 out of 5 stars;Samsung Galaxy s10+;If your scrolling through new phone chargere these are not the move. They connect in and out. I leave my phone next to my bed when i go to sleep and put it on charge, with these sometimes i wake up and it never charged. Thinking about switching to a wireless charging port found some for around 30 bucks and less. Good luck
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not so great;The first charge was fast... after that, not so much. I haven't been able to get my phone to 100% with this charger since the first few charges.
1.0 out of 5 stars;SLOW CHARGER;Says fasts charger but charges extremely slowly. If you're on your phone while it's charging it'll drain or stay on the percentage it was on when you plugged it in. I've purchased cords from Dollar Tree that charge much faster. Only good for charging your phone at night while you're sleeping.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Awful cord;The value was ok, the cords that came with it are awful
1.0 out of 5 stars;Didn't fit my phone;It doesn't fit my phone.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Bad. Do not waste your money;I bought this chargers ., came in a pair , the first one stopped working in the second day. And it was scary hot . Before stop working. And the other one works on and off.
1.0 out of 5 stars;DON'T BUY, CAN POSSIBLY RUIN YOUR PHONE'S BATTERY;Both chargers were defective and unable to charge my phone. Now I have to order new ones to see whether the charger shot out my phones battery or not. I have ordered from this vendor before so I assume they would deliver the same quality, but unfortunately they did not and it's incredibly disappointing.
1.0 out of 5 stars;no fast charging;not as described, no fast charging. tried several phones even those listed in description.

1.0 out of 5 stars;not great;The one charger burned out in the first week
1.0 out of 5 stars;Awful;I bought these for my Galaxy S10 phone and they are the worst chargers I've ever used. They don't fit easily into the phone's port and they take hours to charge the phone starting from 50%.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't charge;Very disappointed in the charger. Doesn't work. Takes more the 4 hours to charge your phone.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Ok;Couldn't get my Samsung phone to charge.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Horrible Charger;These take forever to charge up your phone....definitely NOT a fast charger. Also, cannot connect to my Android Auto when using these cables. Would definitely not buy again.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Fine charger, doesn't have Android Auto capability;Charger cables work fine, but they aren't powerful enough to connect my Galaxy to my truck to enable Android Auto. Recommend buying high quality cables.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Don’t buy!;This chargers don’t work at all. Not even the first day of trying to charge a phone. Please buy somewhere lease but not this!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Terrible;I have a galaxy s10+. Phone is at 21% and its telling me 3hr30 min till fully charged. . . . That should explain why this is a 1 star review. Even tried it with a different cable and still the same.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging;"Not fast charging at all.  At 56% battery, it should not take nearly an hour to fully charge the phone as a ""fast charge"".  Using this with a Galaxy S9.  Likely returning for a charger that actually fast charges."
1.0 out of 5 stars;More Trash For the Landfill;"Product purports to be a ""fast wall charger"" but only charges at the rate of 10% an hour if you're lucky.

2.0 out of 5 stars;Bad cube;Every time I buy two cubes, one doesn't work.😏
1.0 out of 5 stars;Does not charge your phone;It has a very poor connection to phones.  You have to hold the charger at  Specific angle in order for the connection to work and your phone will be allowed to begin charging. Not worth the money.

1.0 out of 5 stars;Terrible;Work terribly
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not worth it.;Buy a braided cable from somewhere else.  This one is extremely short, and if you pull on it just a little trying to see how long it goes, it easily comes out of the socket.  Not even worth $5, imo.

5.0 out of 5 stars;Muy bueno;Bueno carga. Rapido 😊😊
5.0 out of 5 stars;Love the length of these;Can't complain.  They charge fast and the length is longer than typical cords.  They do seem light and of cheaper quality but for this price and how good they work, I can't complain.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great product!;Works great, bought it for my daughter...
1.0 out of 5 stars;These are not fast charging. The turbo chargers you used to sell are the fast charging. These;These are NOT fast charging. The chargers you used to sell that had turbo on them were fast chargers. These from Anker are all slow chargers.

3.0 out of 5 stars;Says fast charging and it's not;I ordered this charger because it was supposed to be fast charging for Android phones. Once plugged in, my phone said slow charging.  I ended up ordering another.  Don't waste your money.
3.0 out of 5 stars;It’s okay…;This is an okay product if you lost your charger or damaged. I wouldn’t recommend it or anything. It’s not as fast and isn’t really that long as least to me.
5.0 out of 5 stars;reliable;justo lo que necesitaba.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great value.Best buy.works great.;I now own 6 of these. I love them. I can keep a unit anywhere I need it. Home, suitcase, car, hotels. Just ordered 2 more sets for friends.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Exactly like my original verizon charger.;Exactly what I wanted.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Nope;It's not fast charging but It will charge like other chargers
5.0 out of 5 stars;Charges quickly as descrived;I have purchased these chargers a couple of times of late after the one received with the phone died.  They work well and charge my Samsung S9+ phone efficiently.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good connector, bad wire.;The conector is good but the wire y bad.
4.0 out of 5 stars;1 out of 5 bad cable, seller handled issue;"1st one I plugged in to use out of the (5)set doesn't connect for charging or data. Checked all others and they work though.*tried 1st one multiple times, sometimes I get the ""check charger connection, slow charging"" but that's not how these are suppossed to work.** Seller contacted me with concern and corrected problem**"
4.0 out of 5 stars;So far it works;Got these to replace others (not this brand)  that have started to give me the slow charging notification on my phone and kindle and wouldn't charge my switch at all. So far they instantly started to charge my phone without the slow charge notification, same with the Kindle. One of the 6.6 ft ones wouldn't charge the switch at all. Worked fine on the kindle and phone. Tried the 10ft on the switch and it instantly showed that it was charging. So I don't know. Gave 4 stars just cause so far one cable isn't working properly or my switch didn't like it for some reason. Will see how long it takes to charge on the 10ft cable and revise the score if it's just a one off with that one cable/my device. They seem to be quite sturdy despite the low cost. I didn't want to pay the same for only one cable at my local store so we will see.
4.0 out of 5 stars;quailty;I needed some USB-C cables because I purchased a new phone. The first cable I tested was the 10ft cable. Sad to say it did not work, the 10ft cable could not charge my new phone or transmit data to my computer.  So I tested the 10ft cable in a head set I have and it would not charge headset. Then I tested the rest of the 4 cables and they all worked great. I believe the quality of these cables are really good or should be. I like the connectors they look solid along with the braiding.I gave 4 stars because 4 out of 5 cables worked.
4.0 out of 5 stars;No  son todos carga rapida;el cable mas largo no es carga rapida
3.0 out of 5 stars;2 of the 5 don’t work;The ones that worked were fine. But 2 of the 5 (the 6ft ones) don’t work at all. No charge comes through them. So if they all worked, it would be great
3.0 out of 5 stars;Charging cords not durable;"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Two of the charging cords no longer work, (6 and 10 foot) they bend too easily at end going to phone and the silver shield came loose and wouldn't allow proper placement into charging port. I still have 3 that work and would like to contact manufacturer but it comes back to Amazon. JivcokJanuary 30, 2023 - I just lost another 6 foot cord. Who do I talk to Amazon about some kind of warranty on these cords?"
3.0 out of 5 stars;Ok;"These are ok. I'm a bit disappointed because one of the 3.3ft cables just doesn't work at all and the 10ft cable says that it does not support fast charge. Do it you're looking for a long cake with fast charge capability look elsewhere. The other cords all work fine and support the fast charging.The other problem is the the silver ""protective"" cover detached easily from two of them already. It's not really a problem, you just have to push it down while plugging in the cord to your phone."
3.0 out of 5 stars;length choices;Some of these have already failed with no apparent damage.  They just don't charge anymore.  I love the 10' one for gaming in the middle of the room.  Some have the outer braiding fraying.  It appears to be cosmetic.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Only 3 out of 5 worked out of package!!!!;Only 3 out 5 worked out of the box.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Charging Cable;They are durable and work great.  I also found it good for the price.  I don't have a problem using them and they charge well.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not as sturdy as expected;Disliked,  they were not very durable or sturdy. Most broke within a few usages
3.0 out of 5 stars;How do cables just go bad?;Good set of USB cables.  Until they weren't...used one of the smaller cables daily in my car for a few months and it was great.  Then my car stopped recognizing my phone.  It would actually act like a broken wire or lose connection because it would come and go depending on how the phone was positioned.  Then it just stopped working all together.  It would still charge but at a slower rate than before.  There was no signs of damage anywhere.  Only thing I noticed was a sharp bend from where it was plugged into the car's outlet.  This must be the culprit.  Pulled out another cable and it didn't even work!  Confirmed this with a 3rd cable.  3rd cable worked great just like the first, until it didn't.  This one only lasted about a month before it started doing the same thing as the first.  I've always had good luck with these in the past but not this time apparently.Update: I was sent a new pack of cables to try out as a consolation.  Same great initial quality.  I will continue to monitor and update this review if anything changes.
3.0 out of 5 stars;These aren't fast charging;You have to use a fast charging block with these cords. The cords on their own are not fast charging. With that being said I used these cords with my fast charging block and they didn't charge as fast as the cord that came with my phone. The cords don't feel like they will hold up.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Poorly made;Poor Craftsman ship
4.0 out of 5 stars;works fine;works fine unless i destroy by not paying attention to where i have them plugged in at
4.0 out of 5 stars;First causality was a few days agou;I bought some and had to exchange them cause the maybe 3/5ths of them were defective or stopped working after a day. No big, the new ones all worked but 1 cable died yesterday. They are cat proof cause my Lil kitty took offense to one and tried attacking it but it held strong. I'd recommend them but quality control needs to be there I think. Still a fantastic product for the money
3.0 out of 5 stars;Only 3 out of 5 work;Still not a horrible value for 3 cords, but question the quality when only 3 out of 5 fast charge out of the box. Would not purchase again.
4.0 out of 5 stars;For the price they're pretty good cables;They're ok cables not real sturdy but you can use them for fast charging
3.0 out of 5 stars;1 of the 6ft cables doesn't work;Ok for the price. One of the 6ft cables doesn't work.
3.0 out of 5 stars;They work.;They seem durable.  The only downside is that in use on 2 different samsung phones, they were not fast charging despite using the samsung original wall plug.  Great for overnight or not needing lightening fast charge.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Check All of the Cables before Using Them;Received the shipment and started to use the cables. Alas, one cable was defective but was already using the others so am not returning them. My advice is to check all of the cables to ensure they all work before actually using them.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great product they're guaranteed to work;Bought a mixed size bag of them only half worked.  Seller immediately reached out to me to make it right sent me replacement cables. So no complaints with his service or the new cables
2.0 out of 5 stars;I will not buy again.;Pulled this out of the packaging used both of the 6 foot cables with my phone and I get an error message saying to check the cable and the brick. I tried plugging it into multiple bricks and power bank and continued to get the same error. Went back to one of my existing cables and no issue. I would nor buy this to charge anything. I'm out my money so do yourself a favor and spend the extra money to get a belkin charger or something reliable.Update: I was contacted by the seller for a full refund. I appreciate them making this right.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Work great, but for how long?;I really like the look and feel of these cables but wonder about their durability.  There is no strain relief at all.  That short black protrusion around the wireat the back of the connector is way too short  and stiff to provide any strain relief. One of my cables is already starting to fray in this area. I would suggest that the manufacturer of these cables flex test them and update the design accordingly.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Mixed feelings;I have a couple of them that have done very well, but I have some that I had to throw away after only a few weeks use.  I don't think I will order this product again.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Good variety of cable lengths, but life of cables don't last long;"Pros: comes in a pack of various cables lengths that can suit different needs. braided nylon cord is niceCons: after a few months, charging speed dramatically decreased on all cables (first to be noticeable was 10ft cable). when seller was contacted, they replied that ""3.3ft and 6.6ft cables are 3A fast charging cables, and the 10ft cable is 2.4A fast charging (because the 10ft cable has a large length resistance, Cable transmission is relatively slow)"" without option to replace"
3.0 out of 5 stars;Eh;So far 1 of the 3 ft cable just gave out and won't work after a few days and the metal casing came off right away.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Only used 2 and both have broken;I used one cord in my car to charge and only used it for about 3 days and the metal part that plugs into phone broke off inside my phone. Second cord I used for about 5 or 6 days and the material that is braided around the cord started unraveling so it wasn't protecting the cord and ended up gluing it so it wouldn't unravel anymore. They aren't made to be very durable and for the power they have and being data sync and charge cables, it's very disappointing to have them break so easily! Would like to know how to get warranty replacements for them but couldn't find a way to contact seller through Amazon, I don't know how to send them a message so I will have to look at the box to find their email I suppose.. I will probably go with a different item all together next time I buy cords!
3.0 out of 5 stars;One of the 6 ft cords in the 5 pack did not work;Out of the 5 pack, one 6.6 ft cords did not work. Instead of the hassle of contacting the manufacturer or dealing with UPS drop off for 12 bucks, I just accepted a $5 credit from Amazon
2.0 out of 5 stars;Cheaply made and don't last;They look good but that's where the good ends.  The plug end fell apart within a month of light use and now I have to play with the ends in order to get it properly connected.  This forces me to push it further into my phone possibly causing internal damage.  Charges very slowly when I could get them to work and often couldn't connect to my vehicle via USB.  I quit using them today and will buy a product with much better reliability despite cost.
2.0 out of 5 stars;I based the star rating on how many of the 5 cables worked;Of the 5 cables in the package 2 worked as described. The 10ft and one 6ft cable didn't work at all. One 3ft cable kind of works but seems really slow. I hooked up a good cable and it read 1hr to charge my phone, switched to the slower cable and it read 32hrs to charge. There was also an alert on the phone about slow charging and to check the cable.The packaging was very poor as well. The cables were just stuffed in a box and looked like it was a return item. The cables themselves seem very thin and the connectors are flimsy compared to other models. I definitely wouldn't recommend this product
2.0 out of 5 stars;Good cable;Does not charge fast at all bought 2 packs just changed my phone to fold takes forever to charge but usefully for charging headphone and everything else besides phones.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Not durable.;Good looking cords.  However they don't last.  Fabric cover tears at attachment ends. Connection ends don't hold up well.  After 5 months of just charging at night while I sleep, I have tohold it just right to keep it charging.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not effective with my Motorola turbocharger;The cables themselves are great but the tips that plug in and out of the phone are pretty cheap and after a couple uses they loosen up and will no longer allow for turbo charging I will not buy this product again
4.0 out of 5 stars;No regrets, in fact will probably buy more;For some reason I was under the impression that these would never break or come apart or that you would have to wiggle them around to get him to work. But I have a Galaxy Note 10, and I have the plugins for the fast charger, one of the cords has to be wiggled around in order for it to fast charge. It will still regular charge, but I have fast chargers for a reason. I' absolutely love the length, and they do seem more durable than a regular phone charger so that I give you kudos. Hopefully it was just the one chord that had its own issues.
2.0 out of 5 stars;USB c has a very loose fit into Pixel 5a port.;I bought the set to use solely for my phone, a pixel 5a.  I've tried all the cables and they all are a loose fit to my phones port. It didn't fit off the bat, I should've returned them right away.  Outside of company cable, Anker has been my go-to. My bad for trying something new.
2.0 out of 5 stars;2 out off 5 do not work;Time to grab another out of box, didn't work. Grab another, doesn't work. Disappointing.
2.0 out of 5 stars;These don't change as quickly as advertised;These just don't charge very fast at all. Luckily, I have a cord that works much faster that takes 45 minutes compared to the two or three hours these cords I ordered do.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Does not work with the LG V60;LG V60 will not recognize this cord
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not a good product!;Half of the chargers worked properly and one of them burned up my s21 ultra charging port so I had to send my phone in to be repaired.
2.0 out of 5 stars;2 of 5 does not work;I've used two of them so far and both of them did not work. I'm not sure if I got a bad batch but so far 2 of 5 does not work.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good, but not for data;I didn't pay close enuff attention, didn't work for data transfer in my truck so went back to old cable with adapter to USB-C.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works;Works
3.0 out of 5 stars;So So product;Kinda  flimsy. Seems a little weak near connection point.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Buyer beware;These USB C charging cords came in a 5 pack of sorted sizes. 4 cords work. One cord will be not charge - or even show that is plugged in at all. We tried several charging USB outlets and USB charging blocks. Nothing. This makes it a 4 pack for the price of of the 5 cord pack. ☹️
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not very durable;The cord began fraying after one week.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great at first, then underwhelming;Originally these charging cords worked well with my Samsung Galaxy S9, but after a month or two, they started working only when inserted one way, and none of them charge quickly. My phone actually gives me an alert saying it is charging at a slow rate, and that I should check the charger connection. Now, after less than six months, two cords have completely stopped working, and two others have unraveled and broken at the point where the charger connects to the phone. I'm disappointed and will be contacting the manufacturer directly to let them know.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Charging cables;All seem fine some minor fraying on one well ussed end.  Product has continued to worsen and has become unusable!  Durability is not good.....
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good value overall;These cords charge well and the braided wraps are nice quality. I removed a star because some of the metal sheathes on the end of the cables were not glued well and have come loose or fallen off altogether. It’s only a cosmetic defect, but a bit disappointing.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Didn't last long;These cords worked well at first. But after a couple months, they charge so slow that my phone loses battery percentage points if I use it at all while charging. My Samsung phone tells me to check the charger connection when I plug it in.
3.0 out of 5 stars;50% defective;Three of the Six cables were defective. My PC could not even identify the attached device much less charge it. I sent a message directly to the Seller but rec'd no replyUPDATE: The Seller contact me after the review was published and resolved the issue to my satisfaction. Raising the rating but still urge caution.
4.0 out of 5 stars;*Update* Excellent customer service, company stands behind their warranty;**Edit** While the original review below is still true, I have changed my overall review to 4 stars because the company reached out and offered to either replace them or refund my money. I had already ordered different cables so I chose the refund but I am very happy to find a company the stands behind their product and warrantees. Very good customer service!Original review:2of these cords are already broken and unusable. They charged fast when they worked but seem to wear out very quickly.
4.0 out of 5 stars;just what I wanted;A lot to choose from.. but I believe that I got a good product.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Just ok;These look nice. There r a lot of them in varying sizes. I had a couple chewed by pets, and a couple that just didn't work from the get go. One of them actually drained my battery.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not well made;Charging capability was fine. However, the plastic cover piece just above the USB C plug-in was loose and slides away from its intended spot. The cord already has a little bit of fraying and I haven't had them very long, maybe a week or two, and they get medium to light use. Ended up returning since they weren't the greatest quality/durability.
3.0 out of 5 stars;works well for a few months then dies;got the 3,3,6,6,10, and all of the cables broke after various time periods. some cables heat up when plugged in and generated heat in the brick/cable, others just refuse to charge.
4.0 out of 5 stars;not perfect, nothing ever is;"I've had these for a couple weeks now, bought them to go with a car lighter socket charger. They're kind of stiff but still flexible, they feel sturdy enough to last a while.Unfortunately, one of the 6ft cables was defective out of the package, even a slight flex drops the charging from ""fast charging"" to ""charging"" and no, it's not the phone's fault.It's not worth returning, the other 4 cables work great. Hopefully the defective cable isn't a sign of durability."
1.0 out of 5 stars;10' Cord Did Not Charge Phone;Do not buy. I should have heeded the advice of other bad reviews and passed on this product. I only used the 10' cord. While plugged in it turned on my charging indicator, but it did not charge my phone. I left it on my phone for an hour or so and the percent battery did not increase. Cords look and feel like good quality, but it just didn't work as advertised. Well, didn't work at all really. Spend the money and get a trusted brand from a trusted seller.
2.0 out of 5 stars;The number of stars is the same as the number of these cables that worked;If you order, test each one of them immediately.  I didn't realize that more than half of them worked until too late to return.  I thought I had a bad outlet until I tried the cables in a different charger/outlet and they didn't work there either.
3.0 out of 5 stars;At least 1 defective;I bought this multi pack. I expect to replace them every year or so, but have only had/used the 10ft cord a few weeks and it's already frayed at the connect and not fast charging. Others in the pack are still charging well at this time, but I don't expect them to last either.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Don't recommend;Two of them didn't even work
3.0 out of 5 stars;C port didnt stay in port, when you pick up;Port was falling out of phone when picking up phone.  So I tried my other c cords, this doesn't happen.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Great value but....;Update: 3 of the cords didn't work. Do not buy.One of the 3ft cable doesn't work, my phone does not recognize it( won't fast charge). Tell me to check connection. The other one is working fine according to my wife. I haven't tried the rest of the cables. Great value as you get 5 cables.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Fraying;Fast charge. Threads fraying at the bend closer to the phone. Visible pattern I like.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Garbage;I assumed I screwed one up so I grabbed another out of the box and it too was barely charging. Thought then my charging port was going bad... But it wasn't. Tried different cable and the phone charged fine (fast charge). Tried these cables on my wife's phone and they did the same thing on hers (slow charging). They do work... Just not as expected.
2.0 out of 5 stars;The connection ends are stiff and breaking;"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I suppose to the price I paid it's not too bad. However there is no soft rubber sleeve protecting the wire that goes directly into the connector.Mine are beginning to separate and fray. The wire itself and connector tips are made of a very stiff and hard material. There would be no way to fix this. I would have to order more."
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not a fast charger....;So after buying these cords to travel with I am pretty disappointed. They are plugged into my factory Samsung charger base and I even tried my other one as well... As you can see from my pic it's not at all a fast charger
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good quality and excellent customer service.;I've only had these cables for a short time, but these appear very sturdy. They should last much longer than the normal plastic or rubber cables you normally get when you buy an electronic device. The variety of lengths match my needs well.One of the cables in my package wouldn't stay connected to the device because the metal sleeve was too close to the end of the connector. I sent the seller a message about the problem. The seller responded very quickly and I had a replacement within two days.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great customers service.;Worked great for first 3 weeks and then cable started to have issues at both end of plugs cause the cables to stop fast charging.Update: was contacted and offered a refund along with an apology for the products to working out as planned. Was very happy with the quick response and great customer service that I will be buying from them again.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Disappointed;These cords do not seem to connect securely and the charging ability is not guaranteed. I'm disappointed.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Avoid the quality of these is shameful and they quit working after just a few days of use;This was the worst set of charging cables I have every ordered.  Each cable only lasted a few days before they failed to transfer a charge.  The connections on the USB side seemed loose, but still the cables worked initially, but after a few days is was like there was a wire broken.  If you played with the cable, a charge would commence, but if you let the cable go, it just stopped.  DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Worked great at first.;I really like the variety of lengths for these cables. I have one I take in other vehicles and another I keep at work. But I've only had them a little over a month and the one I keep at work (which I haven't used much at all) is barely charging my phone now. I've brought an unused one from the same pack to see how it performs. They seem like they would be pretty durable but I don't know why the long work one is charging so slowly now.
5.0 out of 5 stars;The are excellent quality!;The cables are excellent quality, beautiful, they fit perfectly with or without the phone case, and looks like they will last forever.This seller has the best customer service ever, I had a problem with one of the 6ft cables, so, they sent me an extra set of cables for free. I definitely will buy from this seller again
2.0 out of 5 stars;Low charge on 3 amp charging blocka;My Galaxy 8 phones report low charging power even after I bought brand new 3 amp charging blocks. The losses in these cables is way too high. But they did arrive on time and look good, thus the 2 stars
3.0 out of 5 stars;Work well for a month;I've been using the same cable to charge my phone by my bed, a spot where I'm not really moving my phone or the charging cord and it already struggles to keep a connection It will repeatedly connect and disconnect. I have changed the charging port, same. And I don't run into this issue w other similar cords
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not compatible with my car;While these cables are a good value for quantity of cables, I'm having some problems using these for data. One of the 3ft cables works for Android Auto in my Ford Focus, none of the cables work in my wifes Hyundai Kona. It's possible that the Kona doesn't conform to some standard, I suspect it's this cable since none of the previous cables we've used in our cars had this problem. While I've had to buy brand name cables to use for data, these will get distributed around the house for charging purposes only.
5.0 out of 5 stars;great customer service!!!!;So far,  having only received them yesterday,  these seem like a great product.  Out of the box,  one of the cables had a manufacturer defect,  which I reached out to the company that makes them,  and within 2 hours on a Sunday,  there was resolution for the broken cable,  kudos for the customer service.  I prefer to give the company a chance to rectify the situation,  which they certainly did so
2.0 out of 5 stars;Ok for the price;Same as the other brands.  Braided doesn't make a difference.  Will work for a little while, then it'll just stop charging one day.  Pros: it's cheap and different size lengths come in handy.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Nad connections;Have to have the cord seating a certain way in order for it to work properly. Really annoying using in my car to connect to my car and either getting error message or it disconnecting and reconnecting multiple times
2.0 out of 5 stars;Joke;If you think this is any good, this is what it looks like after one week. The material made look good on the outside but it is nothing but cheap Braiding on top of cheap material. Every single cord is broken now. Save yourself some trouble and don't order this.
1.0 out of 5 stars;None of these chargers work at all.;I had not yet opened the pack yet but now that I did, one by one trying to find at least one that worked and none of them are. Other chargers are working on my phone but they are in their last legs so a new one would've been nice, but no. Out of the whole pack, nothing.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Bad connections? I don't know. Charges at regular rate but not fast;Bad connections? I don't know.The reason I got this, it was on Cyber Monday and couple of cables for a decent price.Am I happy with it? Not really. None of my fast chargers are working with at least three cables, of the bunch so far. The connection at the non-C side is very loose, jiggles a lot, and comes out very easy.The C end works, well, fits like a dream.The cord management cable is a nice bonus.
1.0 out of 5 stars;It plugs into the device and not much else;I ordered this in order to charge my most basic devices.  However, while technically it can charge devices It can barely maintain its current power level. For instance my phone's at 3% I plug in my phone while it is still on have no apps open does not charge beyond 3%. This includes Using the device on multiple power bricks. Would not recommend will not buy again
4.0 out of 5 stars;Do not fit my phone;These did not fit my phone.I type in my phone model for the cord that I need. These are not the ones. I have no need for.  And would to send them back.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Good cost but bad charging capabilities;"I bought this charger set because I liked the size and number of chargers I was getting for the amount of money I spent on it. Although the cable is made out of sturdy nylon, the actual charger always had my phone having the following message pop-up: ""please check that the cable is properly connected to your phone""... even though I could see that it WAS connected, and with it being type-c and all, it wouldn't have mattered which side was up or down. Overall, it's obviously worth it to spend the money it costs to buy a one or two-set rather than this type of bigger, but not functional, charger set."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Flexible & fast charging.;Fast charging, flexibility, & different lengths. That's what I liked about this package.
3.0 out of 5 stars;okay i guess;I really only gave this a 3 because the durability is thier. they are strong and long.. but honestly they are not fast charging cords and takes for ever on my galazy s10 ultra . also i cant use them in my car for android auto.. i had to go to att and get another one of thier cords
2.0 out of 5 stars;A COUPLE DID NOT WORK;SOME DID NOT WORK
2.0 out of 5 stars;3 of 5 lasted less than a year.;Only 2 still work, no signs of pinched or broken wires or connector points. updated 9/1/22
3.0 out of 5 stars;Sucky cables;With all the good reviews, people must have not waited a little bit to write them. 2 out of 5 cables don't make good contact in the charging point on my phone. Its the cables because I had others try it on their android phone which it didn't work for them either. 2/4 cables work great. And I haven't tried the 10ft cable yet.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Bad quality cables, don't work properly - UPDATED;They seem to be built well, but in the 5 pack I got, 2 didn't work at all, and 3 only worked one direction, which if you know anything about USB c you should know that it's reversible. Wouldn't recommendUpdate: they reached out and refunded me, and sent new cables. After using them for a couple days, they all seem to be working except for one that only works one way. Changed my rating to 3 stars
2.0 out of 5 stars;Lasted less than two months;I bought these cords at end of March and three cords have already stopped working. I considered it was my charging block after two cords stopped working one after the other but the cords did not work with my new charging block that works with other cords. These chargers are not very durable.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good value;So far so good
4.0 out of 5 stars;Fast charging, but useless for data.;Fast charging, but useless for data.
3.0 out of 5 stars;The short ones worked;All but the 10ft er  or longest one worked....so it could be I got the one bad one....or it's a hit and miss product.  Use caution
3.0 out of 5 stars;Broken Already;Not quite sure how long I've had these, def less than a year. The two I use most often are broken already. I know these things are inexpensive, but I'd like to think I could get a year out of them.
3.0 out of 5 stars;good charging cords, except one was broke.;charge great, and sturdy, however, one of them was broke.
2.0 out of 5 stars;slow charging long cables;the longer cables to to charge well with 5v input.  works ok with QC but not the best.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Garbage;The insanely long charging times made these almost unusable but since they stopped working I guess that's irrelevant.
2.0 out of 5 stars;You get what you pay for;I like charging cables like these. The cables are less likely to snap due to the fabric/rope wire covering. The different lengths on these are good too. But you do get what you pay for. These are pretty cheap so naturally none of them lasted very long. They all somehow lost their fast-charging ability on my phone after 3-4 weeks of use. I bought these 3 months ago and none of the cables fast-charge anymore. They all take 8hrs to full charge my phone which is insane. I know it isn't a problem with my phone since every time I change to a newer cable, it fast-charges. I wouldn't recommend it as your main charging cable but they're good if you want to have spares for guests, leave one in the car or just in case your main cable dies.
3.0 out of 5 stars;4 out of 5 isn't bad.;"One of the 6.6"" cables has taken a turn for the worst. I only use it twice a day, three days a week for work, so this came as a shock. The other cables have held up well enough. Worse things have happened though right?"
3.0 out of 5 stars;Only one fast charges;Out of all the chargers only the longest one fast charges. All others are extremely slow. I tried different outlets and different boxes
3.0 out of 5 stars;Day 2 and one of the cables is messing up;Only been using these cables for 2 days and already 1 of them will not charge my phone if I'm using it. There seems to be a bad connection as it'll ding to say charging and stop, and ding and charge again. Very disappointing! The type of cheaper cables usually last a year before replacement, not 2 days.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Defective items, not cost effective to return;Two of the cords do not work and one has a loose connector. I don't have a UPS store nearby to return. It would cost more in gas and packaging than the original cost.**Update** None of them work after a few months!!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charger;It's say fast charger but it's slow.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Didn't work with Onstar;These cords are very sturdy and durable and I love that they come in different lenghts....but....they will not work my Onstar and Android Auto.  I had to go out and buy a different cord so that I could use Google maps and Amazon music in the car. Now I just use them to charge my phones
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good but....;One of my cord cover started to fray and will only charge if it's plugged in to certain way. Another one has a loose cover over the phone plugged of the cord. I do like them, just wished they weren't falling apart.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Didn't last as long as would have expected;I purchased this set of USB cables over a year ago, and ultimately stop using them because of issues. We used them in the cars, and had issues with them disconnecting from the phones when driving. They worked fine to charge and transfer data when sitting still on a desk, but were not as reliable as would have expected.
2.0 out of 5 stars;It does do fast charge, but stops working soon.;I've had them a little while and they don't charge anymore unless I wiggle the part that goes into the phone in just the right position. Other cables don't have this problem. Except for other crappy cables. Don't bother.
3.0 out of 5 stars;To be expected...5 cords for $11;To be expected...5 cords for $11 - some worked, some didn't. Two of the cords were complete duds, my phone continued to lose charge when they were connected. 3 worked. So I got each cord at around $4. Do the math before you buy.  These aren't a deal.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Do not last long;At first we liked these. but after only 4 months, they were fraying and 1 month later, they no longer are fast charging. 😔
5.0 out of 5 stars;Very durable. Same power and speed as originals;Great cables. Way more durable than stock cables. I'm very rough on my gear and these are still going way longer than a regular cable would. I'm replacing all my other cables with these. You get the same charging power and speed than original cables.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not a quality product.;Definitely NOT fast charging. One didn't work at all right out of the package, and 3 of the others have bad connections or something. No matter where I use them, you have to play with them to keep them connected. Any movement and they go on and off.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Bad cord outta the gate;"One of the 3 foot cords, right out of the box, was no good. Derated immediately. Went to, ""check your connections"" display on phone and charged at a very slow rate, had to dispose of. Others seem to function properly, but I have little faith in longevity of this product."
3.0 out of 5 stars;Did not work for a month;Unfortunately,  these worked great for about a month then the cell phones quit being charged. Too late to return them so my loss.
1.0 out of 5 stars;The cords do not work.;After testing out all of the cords, we found that only half of them work. Both three foot cords work. One of the 6 foot cords doesn't work, and neither of the 10 foot cords work. Unfortunately I didn't find this out until I packed one of the cords for travel. And I had to repurchase a cord while traveling because these failed me. Very unhappy with the purchase and I threw away the packaging so I can't return the item.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Charger;They are coming loose already at metal end
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging.;Durable chargers and the material seems like it would hold up for a good amount of time.  The reason for the low rating is because they don't provide fast charging.
3.0 out of 5 stars;The charger cord looks sturdier than it is actually;I like the selection of lengths. I dislike the lack of durability under normal conditions. The fabric coating began to shrink away from the contact and then the cord started to split after 2 months of regular daily use.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Don't waste your money;They don't do a fast charge
4.0 out of 5 stars;As described;As described
3.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't work when my phone case is on;The chargers themselves seem fine. However. they cannot fit through my otterbox commuter case to properly plug in my phone and charge. Don't see myself taking my case off every time I need a charge, so I'll be passing these along to family.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Durable and reliable;Great durability
3.0 out of 5 stars;Started out wonderful but now not so much;Started out a very good deal I thought but after a couple weeks of being used all but one cord no longer capable of fast charging my device and 2 have started to unravel not worth the price in my opinion
1.0 out of 5 stars;1 cable lasted less than a week;Update 1/20/23: I only have 1 cord still working. Do not buy these cords. Do not buy these cords. The poor, intermittent connections these cords give while they die a quiet death have given me more frustration than any man should have to deal with in a lifetime. Save yourself, don't buy these cords!Seemed like decent cables. 1 cable lasted less that a week, the usb c connector basically fell apart and no longer connects to the phone. We'll see how long the others last
3.0 out of 5 stars;Decent but not anything special;The shorter 3 foot cables have the wrap falling off of them, so you see the white cable underneath. Also they charge a bit slower than other cables I have had. Decent product overall
3.0 out of 5 stars;2 have failed already;Seemed nice, flexible and handled high speed charging. But now 2 have failed so they aren't lasting very long.
2.0 out of 5 stars;It wears out pretty quick;They were great at first, but a few weeks in they started to lose charging capabilities. They started charging very slowly... I wouldn't buy these-
2.0 out of 5 stars;Wears out quickly;I would have preferred one good quality charger to a handful that break after a few months.
2.0 out of 5 stars;I would avoid them.;It came with 5, as I started using them over time I found that 2 of the 5 didn't work from the beginning. Then a third one stopped working on me. The metal housing around the USB-C side is also prone to come off. I never thought that third-party cords would disappoint me, the price savings for these is not worth it in my case.
1.0 out of 5 stars;would NOT fast charge my Pixel 3XL;Most of the positive reviews have got to be fake or else the seller I ordered from is sometimes swapping garbage counterfeit cables.Using the fast charge wall adapter, these cables would only charge my phone at regular speed, even though the advertisement clearly says they are for fast charging.After a week (two weeks at most) they would only slow charge the.  After a couple more weeks they stopped charging all together.  They must have very poorly soldered connections.  Complete garbage.Now I have to buy new cables and this time I'll spend more money to get better quality, which is what I should've done to begin with.  I shouldn't have trusted the reviews saying they were good cables.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Slow to charge and Google phone doesn't respond unless manually set every time plugged in;Very slow charge and my google pixel3 gets hot. Also, it doesn't auto charge - every time you plug in you have to go into your settings and flip/flop how your phone relays through this cord for it to receive power. Wouldn't buy again.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good seller;Good value for the price.
1.0 out of 5 stars;2 of them dont work;2 of five dont work
5.0 out of 5 stars;Well Worth The Money;These cables are worth the money. They are well built and durable. I purchased 2 sets to charge my wife’s and my units. I put one in each car, by the bed, and in the living Room.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Best stocking stuffer;Best gift for the wife that always loses her charger cables..... this comes with a bunch so I figure I would have at least a couple months before she would lose them all and starts using mine again....
5.0 out of 5 stars;Very well made, Excellent value;High quality cables! The only negitive is the outer covering is ruff/coarse and will snag on carpet or furniture. These work great and are very well made.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Buena compra a un buen precii;Funciona correctamente
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not as advertised;"Not actually braided, just a braided cover. 1 month after getting these the cover is already coming off. Sometimes have to ""flip"" the charger over for fast charging."
2.0 out of 5 stars;Just frustration;"Just an honest review. I dont recommend this purchase. You only get what you pay for. 2 out of 5 currently working. The 1 that I took to work for my desk never worked. Coworkers laughed ""you got 5 changing cables and paid how much?"" This item was purchased on October 11th I'm sure it arrived 2 days later. (Got to love Prime shipping) today's date is December 3rd and I'm back looking for something that will hopefully work little longer.At $2.18 a cable. You'll always get what you pay for."
1.0 out of 5 stars;Quality;Cord did not charge! Poor quality
3.0 out of 5 stars;Disappointed;was hoping for a better result.  cords fraid after a couple of months and longer cords did not deliver consistent charging.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Very happy with product;The cable cords arrived quickly and have met our needs quite well. It's nice having different sizes/lengths for the car, computer and charging station to fit our various needs
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not worth it;They really don't last very long.  I've gone through 2 in 6 weeks.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Durability isn't there;3/5 of these cords no longer fast charge. It's been a month and they're basically useless already. It shouldn't take 4 hours and 36 minutes to charge a phone.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charging.;Charges slow,
1.0 out of 5 stars;QC seems to be Hit and Miss;Update (3/14/21): The other 6.6ft cable has stopped working and is falling apart. Leaving me with only a 3.3ft and a 10ft cable that works. It has been a month from my original purchase, based upon my experience with the cables, I would suggest steering clear of these.____________________________________2 of 5 cables did not work out of the box (a 3.3ft and a 6.6ft). The other three cables work fine, sometimes they need to be replugged in for them to actually connect and charge. The braided exterior is a nice feature to help stop kinking and breakage. That being said with only 60% of the cables working, it seems hit and miss with quality...Also none of the cables charge in the work trucks, frequently connects and disconnects then gives up. Tried them in 2 different F-150s, a Ram 1500s, and newer Jeep Cherokee. So I ended up having to buy a gas station charger cable...
1.0 out of 5 stars;Garbage;I never leave reviews but these are trash. Had them about a month and they are all fraying and falling apart. The kicker was when my phone actually alerted me by message that the charger was slow. Spare yourself and buy elsewhere.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Only 3 work;Only 3 do fast charging and the other two which were one of the 6ft and 10 ft cord.
2.0 out of 5 stars;No duran nada;No sn buenos.Se parten enseguida y no cargan
2.0 out of 5 stars;STIFF!!;Very stiff cord!!! Charges well.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charge;I can leave my phone plugged in overnight with these chargers and still not be at 100% battery. I have another charger from a different company entirely. That charger charges my phone at a normal speed so I know my phone isn't the issue. I wouldn't recommend these chargers unless you typically SEVERELY overcharge your phone.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not acceptable charging for my phone;Bought these cords to charge my phone and tablet. The cords tried the different lengths but they didn't put the phones in charging mode. Returned the cords will never but these cords again. I would not recommend them to anyone.
3.0 out of 5 stars;4 cables came as C ... the other one came as micro usb;I'll keep only because I have a Nook I can use the micro usb on
3.0 out of 5 stars;one of the 3 ft cords did not work;one of the 3 ft cords did not work
1.0 out of 5 stars;Sucked and fell apart!;These chargers are the worst. The chargers in the first pack started falling apart after a couple of days to the point that the wires connected to the charger piece were exposed. I requested a replacement and the same thing happened. Do not buy these charger cords. They are a fire hazard and not worth a penny.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Poor for traveling;These do not hold up well for traveling.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Missing one cable? But good stuff;Pretty decent cable but 3 stars cause I only received 4 cables instead 5. Thick cables and fast charging .so far so good.
2.0 out of 5 stars;NOT a data transfer cable.;The cable charges fine, but my laptop could not see my phone even though it is hooked up to it and charging. I bought these because the description says it's a transfer cable.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charge. Good vendor communication, though;NOT fast charging cables. Don't work with android auto.However, the vendor was great at communicating, and gave me a refund for my troubles.Wouldn't recommend the product, but the vendor was very apologetic.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Short lived;Used this cord in my vehicle and only a short time later it started having issues. Slow charge and no data transfers.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not so good;2 of the chargers didn't work and the rest didn't last long
3.0 out of 5 stars;Durable but not fast charging;They don't fast charge my Samsung s9.  They'll last, they're sturdy just not handy to have to wait 15 minutes or more for 2 or 3% more battery life.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Literal trash;Half the cables didn't even work. Not only did they not fast charge they trickle charged so slow my phone was dying faster than they charged
1.0 out of 5 stars;junk!;"Kept the 10 footer in my luggage. Never used it at home. Same for the 6.6 footer ( wife's suitcase). Used both cords less than a dozen times. BOTH cords failed at the ""C"" connection at about the same time. The only positive thing is they were inexpensive. I guess you really do get what you pay for."
1.0 out of 5 stars;3 cable no connectivity;Right put the box, neither 6ft nor the 10ft cord work. Complete trash. Don't waste your money, these 5 cords are a waste of time.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Do NOT buy this garbage;4 of the 5 stopped working and the last one is about to fall apart only after 1 week of use.Do not buy these you're wasting your money and time. I was not given an option for refund. They wanted me to send the cords back but I threw them in the trash so I couldn't return them.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Awesome;Hi! Just to say that the product is as advertised. Looks good and durable! Definitely recommended!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging;I wanted to believe they would be perfect. But after about 2 weeks, I realized when I had something plugged in, I was still losing charge. It's obvious that there's no fast charging. You can also check the device and it will show you whether it's fast charging or not. I just tried it again tonight and with 40 percent battery left, I plugged the cable into a portable battery pack (it charges every other item I own without any problems). After. 20 to 30 minutes, the device powered off. Needless to say, I wasn't too happy. I haven't written many reviews, but I felt obligated to share this so no one else. Gets ripped off.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charger;Too slow
3.0 out of 5 stars;You get what you pay for;Work for a bit...then break or bend and stop charging the phone.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not A Long-Term Item;I bought these in February 2021 & as of today (07/31/2022) none of these work properly. They all appear to have some kind of short or something. They either don't charge at all or you have to move the cords around to position them in order to semi get a connection. Very disappointed.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Wears out quickly;Did not last long at all, short in the cable in 3 of the ones I bought.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Poor quality;Cords are already fraying after 1 week.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Works, but they don't last long;I bought this pack of usb-c cables in October, and I 4 of the 5 have already broken. I only use one cable at a time, and at best they last 2 months before they either snap or break. I am not rough on them either. I assume in 2 more months the last of the 5 will break and I will have to buy new cables again.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great cables!;These cables are just what we needed.  2 Fast charging cables for the car and 3 cables for the house.  I prefer fast charging, braided cables and these cables are perfect.
5.0 out of 5 stars;You can never have enough chargers;Love these chargers. At this great price I have them in every room and every car. Never had one fail or break.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Metal cover comes off of the type-C side easliy.;These cables take effort to charge your phone properly with fast charge. The outlets were tested and are fully functional. Possible defective batch of cables. The 10ft cable does work fine.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not as fast as I had hoped. Less that 50% as fast as the original phone charger.;But the build quality seems quite good and the lengths are great.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not all cables worked;They look and feel good, but several of the cables did not work.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Just a cable, noting exceptional;One of the cables was damage while in shipping. Other than that they are decent
2.0 out of 5 stars;One charger (so far) dose not work;Just received the cords and one of them dose not work. And i can not find the contact info for the company.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not what I expected;The main reason this was ordered was for the 10 ft chord.  The other four work well but the ten foot did not work at all!  So, if ordering for the long chord, you may not get what you want!!!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Durable cable construction;Now I don't have one cable from one device to another. Just what the doctor ordered, this multipack.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Bueno;No me agrado su calidad es baja
5.0 out of 5 stars;good cables;good cables
1.0 out of 5 stars;One of the five cables was severely defective.;See the photo. Notice that the the cable is attached only to the computer. The other four cables were OK, or at least don't bring up this error. I never thought to check them on arrival. cables just ought to work. Moral of the story: From now on check everything when it arrives and assume nothing.I suppose this is just one bad from a huge bunch of good cables. But it is scary that it failed in this way. luckily I tried it with the computer and not a power adapter.
1.0 out of 5 stars;10 ft ones don't work;Have to keep messing with too get them to charge
1.0 out of 5 stars;Do not buy;Only 1 of the 5 cables worked.

2.0 out of 5 stars;Not consistent;I always get the check connection when using these cords. Other brand cables do not do this so I know it is not my phone.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Loses connection;Tested on multiple Samsung phones. 3.3ft and 6ft both would connect/disconnect/connect/disconnect without moving the phone.Other cables purchased are not seeing the same issue.Emailed the support email and never got a reply.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Fraying near the connector;This cable worked fine for a few months but the woven part started fraying and now it charges intermittently or slower than it used to. Apple’s cables don’t do this.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Cable;Cable
1.0 out of 5 stars;Receieved 4/5 cords;The cords seem fine I just didnt receieve one in a sealed package It would be my bet this is standard procedure.  Im sure ill be contacted to recieve my full order but regardless this company provides less than ordered and then hopes you dont notice.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not durable three broke after 2 months;Three broke after two months!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Quick charging,  but cords quit charging after awhile;I really liked that this included different lengths of cords. They did charge quickly. But they just didn't last very long. The cord itself didn't fray or detach, they just quit charging. I used with two different phones with same result.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Unreliable, flakey USB C connection.;Very unreliable. Two of the cables stopped working after about a week, flakey connection at the usb-c side. I often have to wiggle or unplug/plug back in to my phone to resume charging. They look nice but the unreliable connection is a deal breaker for me. They'll be destined for the trash can soon.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Poor Quality;I've been using 3 out of the 5 cables in the past two months. Two of them are no longer fast charging. It would normally charge my phone from 1 percent to 100 percent within 1 hour and 30 minutes. The 2 faulty cables, now indicates 6 hours charging time.  Im currently using a Samsung galaxy s10.
5.0 out of 5 stars;does exactly what I wanted;I needed a very large usb c charging cable and this was perfect
5.0 out of 5 stars;These are better than described!;These cords are extremely durable. They charge wonderfully. And they are perfectly priced.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Fall apart;Got at the end of Nov and I have already gone through half the pack. They fall apart quickly
1.0 out of 5 stars;Save your money, don't purchase;These worked fine for a few weeks. Than stopped charging my phone slowly. A week after my returnable date and the chargers dont work. My phone is literally dying even though it is plugged into my fast charging box. When the original cord that came with my phone is used, my phone charges just fine. It is not the box, these cords are crap. Dont purchase
2.0 out of 5 stars;The are not durable;I went through two cords within two weeks.  😳 Amazon need to have better quality control.  I usually relate Amazon with good to great quality and service.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Carga super lenta;Carga super lenta,galaxy note 10 plus original dura carga de 1 hora 20, pero con este cable 4 horas
2.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped charging after a few weeks;With moderate use, all 5 charges stopped charging or had a short in it after a few weeks.No bad usage was used for the cords. Normal daily charges.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging cables.;Not supporting fast charging.Good looking cables.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Charges very slow;Takes forever to charge
3.0 out of 5 stars;Okay;Okay. Generic.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Wrong as chargers;They apparently are made well but the end piece is a bit larger than the charging hole on my phone. I need a sz down.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Do not buy poor quality cable;half of the cables were not working right out of the box and other not upto the speed phone was charging but it was draining more battery than charging. Tried multiple charger same issue then changed changed to different cables with same charger it worked. Bought 2 packs of cables had same issue in both pack like 3 cables out of the box didn't work. Also bought IPhone cables from this manufacturer had same issue.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Disappointed;I was really excited to get some good strong cables to charge my phone's. Unfortunately two of the cables have already failed when only used less than a month. They both failed where the cable connects to the usb C connector.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Disconnecting while charging;The cable kept disconnecting while charging. I tried all cables /cords.  Over several daysCables were in tight at connection Pixel 4a phoneMust have been a faulty set
2.0 out of 5 stars;Terrible;It's been about 2 months now and 4 of the 5 cables have stopped working properly. Each cable seems to last about 2 weeks before it will no longer charge any of my devices.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not a very good product for fast charging, but customer assistance quickly contacted me right away.;After using these, 3 of the cords started coming loose at the part that goes into the phone or tablet, and it says that it is fast charging but it doesn't really work, I noticed that the battery percentage was decreasing while it was charging.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Worked than Stopped Working;They started working Fine. Fast Charging and all than the Fast Charging stopped and it just charged Regularly even when I changed the charger brick and the unit used.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Bad buy;Was so excited because they looked durable. But sadly, 2 of the set were defective from the beginning (no connection at all) then 2 didn't last 1 week before I had connectivity issues. On the last cord now. Worst buy I ever made
1.0 out of 5 stars;Very disappointed.;Very disappointed. 2 of the cables were assembled incorrectly and would not seat in the usb-c port of my galaxy s21.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not so good.;These began to fall apart after a week. The metal cap on the usb C ends comes off the wire, its just pressed on, this means the wire must be pushed thru to connect to a fone.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Dissapointed;Less than a month of use and the nylon coverage is unraveling. Smartphone is saying the charge is slow, not fast, when connected to one of this cables.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Easily fall apart ...poor construction.;Work for a week and then pieces started falling off. Plastic covers at terminals....don't buy
1.0 out of 5 stars;Nice Cables, but don't last;This is an amended review for this item. I have 3 cables now that will not work at all or work every once in a while. I would look elsewhere for these type of cables.I have been using cables for about a week and so far they seem to be working fine. They are rated for Fast Charging and they are fast charging devices. USB-C end is a light tight when inserting into USB-C devices but they are working fine for now.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Started freying right off the bat;You could get the same quality  at a dollar store and I'm not being  sarcastic..Started fraying  immediately.Reading  other reviews shows that  its not a single issue but an overall poor quality  product  being  sold as a quality  product...far from it!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Dangerous and defective product.;Dangerous and defective product.  Mine wouldn't charge my S21 phone. The USB C end becomes super hot. My phone was unplugged with the USB cable near me . I touched the USB c end to unplugged it and burnt myself.  The USB C end was very hot. I am glad I found out the cabke end was hot before it had started a fire.. I requested and was issued a refund.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Waste of money;Not reliable. Does not function most of the time.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Slow Charging 8 hours for cell phone.;The cords take forever to charge a cell phone or tablet. If you are charging while using the cords, you actually loose charge. If I use cords while driving with my GPS, my phone will run out of power within an hour.  I do not recommend these cords.
1.0 out of 5 stars;No sirve, pésima calidad;Soy comprador 1a de Amazon y no suelo comentar, pero compré 5 de estos cables y todos se me dañaron en menos de una semana. No cargan, el conector se deteriora rápido del cable, y que conste que soy súper cuidadoso con los cables pero está fue una pésima compra. No lo recomiendo para nada.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Only lasted 6 months;The mesh decorative outside came apart within a few months. Now after 5-6 months the charging cable no longer works.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not worth the money;Does not charge phone anymore.  These products worked well for about 2 weeks.Durability is okay.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Cheap Garbage;Ive bought some of these before of a different brand and they worked amazing. IMPORTANT! FIRST of all, these CHARGE SLOW. These do not allow fast charging. If you have fast charging capability, look for something different. Also, the metal covers come of super easy. Almost every cable i have, the metal cover over the wire to pin connector has come loose. One tiny drop of glue is all that holds them on. They are unsightly and unsafe when those come off. I DO NOT recommend purchasing these cables.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good cable;Great charging cable, I highly recommend.
1.0 out of 5 stars;These cables are not high quality;I bought these is June of 2021.  They have not lasted even three months.  I could see if it was one of the cables, but every single cable is frayed at the same spot on the device end.  The cords worked fine with fast charge, but i am not happy at all. Dissapointed.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Zero fast charge;No matter what size USB Cable length has Zero Fast Charging when plugged into wall outlet.
2.0 out of 5 stars;2 of 5 cables defective out of the box;2 of the 5 cables are defective, both of which are the longest ones. Would not buy again.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Quality Cables;Love the price for these quality cables.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Poor Quality, pretty cable;Do not buy, unless >50% discount. At least one did not work out of box. Pretty cable, poor quality. Guaranteed to be disappointed should be labelled on the box.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Make sure its the right one even if amazon says so!;I was looking for a power adapter cord for my phone . this ad said that this adapter was for Samsung phones ,  so i bought it .well it didn't fit my Samsung phone . now i am back to looking for one that works on mine i may have to go to a store to find one .
1.0 out of 5 stars;Complete crap;do not buy! Not durable, Only used a few times and already it is very touchy on positioning to get in to charge. Also message constantly pops up on my phone slow charging when using. I thought it was just a couple of the cords but I've since tried using other ones and they are all crap very positional to get them to actually charge.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Total rip ofd didn't last 2 mos;"Didnt even last 2 months total rip off. The braided ""protective' exterior is shredding and coming apart on all of them.  Charges fast when it works.  Dont buy."
1.0 out of 5 stars;Cheap and not reliable for fast charging;Fast charging only works if you wiggle the wire, take it out, put it back in about 5 times. Even then you might wake up to see that it wasn't fast charging. Connecting with Android auto in the car is also a problem because it disconnects constantly.Can't return, so leaving this review to steer others away!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Don't buy this model;Two broke in under a month. Cheap quality, cheap price. It is what it is.

1.0 out of 5 stars;Not as durable as they seem or as the company says;I have had these cables for 3 1/2 months and I have already gone through both 6ft cords and the 10 ft cord is on it's way out. They work great and then all of the sudden the cords stop fast charging. Never have gone through cords this fast. I would not recommend buying.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Don't waste your $;Ends fraying and only connects with lot of moving around the cord.. Don't waste your $
1.0 out of 5 stars;They don't last, look elsewhere.;The cables are already starting to fall apart only after 2 months.  The nylon sleeves are not secure and slide right down the cable while the cable itself isn't secure either, I have wires exposed on both my 3 foot cables where the cable meets the USB-C connector. They look nice and presentable, but don't last.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not Durable;This product does not charge for long. Cord not durable.
1.0 out of 5 stars;No fast charge;It states that it us a fast charge. This is not true! My phone was at 11% last night and it took it 8 hours to fully charge. Be aware what you are truly getting.

1.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped working after 5 months;All charging cables have stopped working by now. These were purchased in at the end of March, so I got maybe 5 months of use. Find a better quality product to buy that will last longer.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Potentialy Dangerous;Item arrived unsealed in any form. After further inspection of the packaging found spelling and grammar mistakes consistent with fraudulent products. Given the country of origin I did not dare use these cables out of fear for my data, my privacy, and the safety of my devices. DO NOT USE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE!!!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charge, tip got loose;"This review is written three months after the purchase date. The product looks great, but they don't last.  Only one is still working.

1.0 out of 5 stars;The worse purchase I made was this 1 the cords don't charge unless you move them around.;I dislike this purchase period.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Don’t Buy;One cord overheated and two immediately broke after minimal use. Not worth it.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not good;Already stopped working so disappointed
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not durable;Within two months,  two cables did not charge. Junk
1.0 out of 5 stars;One cord wont charge. 2 broke very fast;Bad quality. one does not work. 2 more broken very quickly.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Do not buy these!;Terrible. Stop working after 6 weeks.
1.0 out of 5 stars;10 foot cables did not charge!  No response from seller;10 foot cables did not charge!  No response from seller
1.0 out of 5 stars;JUNK;They were delivered damaged and not in working order
1.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charging;Charging power is not there with these cables
1.0 out of 5 stars;Poor quality;One cord has already gone bad used twice
1.0 out of 5 stars;Do not charge;They do not charge sadly.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Don't buy;Terrible, very slow and wires break fast
1.0 out of 5 stars;None of the cords worked;Cords didn't work on any of our phones
1.0 out of 5 stars;Sucks;Chargers did even work
1.0 out of 5 stars;Wrong cable;Wrong charger for iPhone
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good for the price;They stop working if bent a certain way .. only had a month and and already threw away 3
4.0 out of 5 stars;Very useful, durable and affordable!;These USB cables are very useful specially with the 3 different size length for various locations.The cords seems durable, and thick but flexible.Honestly I haven't found anything that I dislike or that is wrong/faulty with this usb cord. The only thing I wish is that the package could have come with Two 10ft cables since that size is was I been needing more than the 3.3ft cords since I have a few small length ones already.The USB and C connection work with any charger that one can have without any problems, great fit.Our Galaxy phones, tablet, and other electronics get a countious charge with no problem and fastI highly recommend this product plus the price is so affordable for 5 usb cords, cant beat that bargain.*I hope this review has been useful. It is my honest opinion from actually using this product on a daily basis.*
3.0 out of 5 stars;Already broke;It broke after 2 months of use. Not worth it save ur money despite of 5 star reviews
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good;Great chargers except one of my 3ft ones does not work.... didn't notice until I tried using it a month after buying it
3.0 out of 5 stars;Most of them Work;They seem to be well built but the 10 foot one I purchased was not charging at all. My Galaxy S9 showed that it was charging but the battery was still being drained. However, the other ones have worked well so far.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Sturdy Cables;Solid and strong cables. No tangle and will suit all of your charging needs with the various different  sizes.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Half of the cords won't even add charge to the phone!;"Half of the cords are no good. Phone battery either stays at the same percentage or actually decreases while plugged. I tried with multiple charging blocks. The ones that don't work always show a, ""Check your charger connection"" when plugged in. The others work fine/fast, but I didn't pay for only half!"
5.0 out of 5 stars;Nice cables.;"These are nice USB-C cables -- I used them with a 65-watt USB-C charger to charge up a couple of notebook computers, and they worked just fine.They have a ""braided"" covering, and they are quite flexible.  I appreciated their build quality.The cables performed well during my testing, and I experienced no issues or problems, whatsoever.  I recommend them without hesitation."
5.0 out of 5 stars;A nice variety size pack of cables;They charge and transfer data quickly as promised. I use them for my phone and many tablets. They have a good quality nylon braiding that definitely increases their durability. The blue nylon braiding also helps in distinguishing them from your other cables that tend to be black or white. I would definitely recommend these cables.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Issues with quality;Look great and seem to function well, initially.So far after 6 months they are charging fast which was my primary need. However, 2 of them will not transfer pictures from phone to pc. I used an Amazon Basic cable to handle that task. Good price, so just consider your risk.
2.0 out of 5 stars;I've bought a few sets of these... they're all coming apart.;I bought a few of these, since they seemed to be sturdy/hearty kinda' cords, but the tips have all loosened up  and now you have to push the cable through the end to use it, since they came apart. I've never seen this with any other phone cords in 20 years. Other usually wear out by exposing the inner wires at the stress point just below the end... but these have ends that come apart.
2.0 out of 5 stars;These are not good;This product is not good for me. It worked perfect at first. Then each one just stopped working or charging fast. I am down to one now and it works when it wants to. I am in need of more but I will NEVER rebuy these or from this company.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not the best;They worked fairly well for a week or so then one by one stopped charging.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Cable has extremely slow transfer speeds, and the cable isn't as durable as you'd think;Part of the cable has fallen apart. Transfer speeds using this cable is extremely slow, just moving one music file to a phone takes 30 minutes
1.0 out of 5 stars;Worked great, until it didn't;Bought two packages, one for me and one for my wife, and all the cords have failed. The package I got seemed to fail faster than the others. I can still get them to work occasionally if I plug, unplug, plug, until it works. Usually takes a convenient 10-15 tries.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Will not hold charge.;Absolutely no good...I wasted money I used and shared with others and we all had the same result. They worked fine for a few changes Every cord I tried my phone and other devices reported a bad charge and to check my connection. Tried multiple chargers and got the same results.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Over time the protective braid wears out and charging becomes intermittent.;I expected product to last longer with minor usage.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Snap at connection point to phone;All broke within a month. Do not buy
1.0 out of 5 stars;Don’t buy;Worked for a month. Junk
1.0 out of 5 stars;dont buy;4 of them, already not working.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Cables are durable but stopped working after about a month;Ordered these cables in July. By September only one was still charging properly. Stick with Anker or Aukey.
1.0 out of 5 stars;started good, but quickly stopped charging well;I liked these cables for the first 6 months or so, then found that I could leave my devices plugged in all night and they wouldn't quite reach 100%. Took me a while to narrow it down, but eventually I was able to confirm that across devices, across outlets, etc., all my other cables still charged well, but these cables (the only blue ones I own) consistently underperformed everything else
4.0 out of 5 stars;Convenient - tight fit;The choice of 3 sizes is convenient for different situations. Users need to know that the USB C connector can be a tight fit to the cellphone port and you may need to push it hard to get it in far enough to make a good connection to the phone.
5.0 out of 5 stars;perfect;bought a cable like this at the att store. one cable for $21. took it back and bought these. work just as good and are far cheaper... ordered a 2nd time so we have them everywhere in the house and vehicles.
5.0 out of 5 stars;good cable;good cables.  there, I have written the required amount.  i just wanted to give them 5 stars, but amazon makes it difficult just to do that.
4.0 out of 5 stars;So Far So good will update if any changes;the appear very durable I hope that they are and will last so far they charge fast and seem tough.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Long and strong;Great set of various length cords. Can now power up at the end of the day while using my phone in bed.
5.0 out of 5 stars;USB C cables 3A;Great value.  Have not used braided cables before but looks good. All cables functional when received.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Son demasiado buenos carga rápido mi Celular. Es bien barato;Me agradó mucho el producto y bien barato me carga el celular rápido los reviendo
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging;Not fast charging at all
1.0 out of 5 stars;Don't waste your money.;2 didn't work out of the box. Others were constantly loosing connection with phone had to keep adjusting to charge devices. I have bought other cheap charging cords on Amazon some worked great this brand did not. Would have returned but my significant other threw one away as we were traveling when we first used them.
4.0 out of 5 stars;One faulty cable;One of the 6.6 foot cables doesn't work. The other 4 cables function properly.
1.0 out of 5 stars;DO NOT BUY;Inconsistent connectivity....What???? Pops on and off like a bad internet connection. It's just a charging cable for petes sake. Look elsewhere, pay more or less but look elsewhere.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn’t work on my iPhone or iPad;Does not work on iPad or iPhone at all, so I returned. BrexLink is a little more expensive but does work!
5.0 out of 5 stars;...;Very durable and sturdy
3.0 out of 5 stars;They are okay;One wasn't good but for the price they work well.
5.0 out of 5 stars;I like it. Durable.;Great product for the price.
1.0 out of 5 stars;These Are Awful;BOTH the 6ft cables don't work.  I haven't tried the others.  The charging symbol pops up for 2 seconds and then goes away.  Used an old cord, and that fast charges just fine, so it's nor the plug/adapter.  I am so mad right now!
5.0 out of 5 stars;c type cables;Love these fast charging cables enought for me and my husband to use very sturdy I love their flexibility
1.0 out of 5 stars;NOT fast charging cables;"These are NOT fast charging cables. I got these because they were advertised as fast charging cables. The ""3 hour until full"" screenshot is with these cables attached. The ""1 hour until full"" screenshot is with another charging cable I got from Amazon (those are no longer available).These would be great if they were açtually fast charging.  I'm disappointed in these chargers and will continue my search for actual fast charging cables that come in a variety of length for an affordable price. These had everything except they didn't work."
4.0 out of 5 stars;charging;as stated
3.0 out of 5 stars;some worked. some were faulty. but i got it for like $7;probably can find more reliable and better working USB type c cables
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not good for my phone;Did not fast charge. Started falling apart on the first day.Update: I have updated my review to 3 stars because customer service handled the situation very well and offered me a refund. I appreciate good customer service and I would purchase from this seller just for that.
1.0 out of 5 stars;NOT FAST CHARGING;NONE These cables will fast charge.  I have 5 samsung S10 phones, 2 Samsung S6 lite Tabs. None will fast charge.  It's not the charger, my previously bought agvee cables all fast charged.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not usb capable;I bought this specifically to connect to my car for the auto connect app so this didnt work at all for that and dodnt mention it wasnt actually usb capable
4.0 out of 5 stars;It will serve its purpose as car adapter;Doesn't charge as fast as Samsung cord
1.0 out of 5 stars;Flimsy;Metal case fell off within days
2.0 out of 5 stars;10' cord bad;The 3' and 6' cords worked fine.  The 10' cord would not charge a phone at all.
3.0 out of 5 stars;2 of the 5 cords do not work, at all;I thought these would be great cords, but one of the 6.6' ones did not work at all. In fact, when I plugged it into a multi port adapter none of the cords plugged into that adapter worked as long as it was plugged in. They all worked when I unplugged the one from this package.  This is a 20% failure rate for the package I received. Right now I do not have time to return them for a better brand. I'll use the other 4, but I won't buy these again.
2.0 out of 5 stars;They dont last long;I re purchased more of these because the ones i bought a month or 2 ago didnt last very long
2.0 out of 5 stars;Two chords have stopped working;2 of the five cords have stop working.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Only received 4 out of 5 cords;Only received 4 out of 5 charging cards. Not worth the hassle of returning. Oh well.
3.0 out of 5 stars;NOT fast charge.;The charger that came with my phone charges faster than ANY of these (yes I tried them all)
2.0 out of 5 stars;Pesimos;No sirven se empezaron a romper la tela protectora y el metal de la entrada se le cayó eso sin contar que no cargan correctamente
4.0 out of 5 stars;Durabilidad;Con el tipo he tenido problemas con los conectores
4.0 out of 5 stars;Muy buenos calbes, quick charge 3.0;Los compre y los acabo de probar. Los cables (Excepto el de 3 metros) aceptan quick charge 3.0 (carga rapida). Para celulares no tan viejos como iphone 8 y mi LG se cargan en menos de una hora con un cargador de 18 watts quick charge 3.0. Es necesario tener ambos para que funcione.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Despues de 1 año de uso, dejaron de funcionar 2 de los 5 cables;Hice la compra en Septiembre del 2020, funcionaban perfecto, los uso en mi auto, para transmitir datos, para cargar celulares y tablets, funcionan con carga rapida y transmiten datos con buena velocidad, pero despues del uso, a los 6 meses dejó de funcionar uno de 6.6 ft, y 14 meses despues tambien el de 10 ft, sin embargo vale la pena la compra, los demas cables siguen funcionando al 100%, si llega a fallar un cable más, volveré a comprar otros 5 iguales.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Excelente;Muy bueno la verdad me gustan
4.0 out of 5 stars;Calidad regular, buen precio, buena cantidad de cables;Calidad 7/101 de los cables de 6.6ft (2m) como que tiene falso y aveces carga y aveces no, además que se está dañando el cable cerca de la entrada al teléfono (tengo menos de 2 meses al momento de escribir esto)El de 10.ft (3m) no carga rápidoSolo los de 1m y 2m, cargan rápido
4.0 out of 5 stars;Buena relación calidad precio;Funcionales para cargar el celular, no tanto para transferir datos
3.0 out of 5 stars;Después de un tiempo no hace carga rápida;Después de cómo mes y medio/2 meses la cubierta del cable se empieza a recorrer y también después de ese tiempo no siempre hace la carga rápida, es como de contentillo, a veces si y a veces no, tomé uno de los que no había usado y ese como está nuevecito pues si carga bien, por eso estoy escribiendo esta reseña para que busquen algo mejor. El cable original de mi galaxy s8 me había durado más de 3 años y siempre hizo la carga rápida.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Buen producto, 5 cables largos y de buen material;Son muy buenos y funcionan bastante bien, tal vez una medida de largo más chica estaría mejor, y lo único que no se me hizo bien, es que mi dispositivo no reconoce super charge, pero en general, muy recomendables
3.0 out of 5 stars;Calidad variable;Desafortunadamente el producto que me llegó tenía fallas, solo 2 de los cables funcionaban y fue una lastima porque la longitud estaba increíble. Aunque la calidad no se veía tan buena.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Se rompieron fácil;Se rompió fácil
3.0 out of 5 stars;Buenos;"la relacion calidad precio es buena, los he usado poco pero no he notado que sean de carga rapida, se me hacen "" normales"" cargan normal a pesar de tener cargador de 33 w"
4.0 out of 5 stars;Donde lo requieras!!;Genial para colocarlo en multiples locaciones!!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Buena resistencia. lo único que mejoraria es que no son de carga rápida;Buena resistencia. lo único que mejoraria es que no son de carga rápida
2.0 out of 5 stars;8 meses después todos a la basura.;8 meses después. Todos a la basura, o se despega el chapuzón, se empiezan a deshilar, dejan de servir carga rápida, o de plano no funcionan. Te sacarán del apuro si necesitas varios, pero nada recomendable, pues vas a tener que comprar uno bueno después. .Son lindos, sí, funcionan para sacarte de apuro al principio sí, pero no vale la pena comprar pensando en que te van a durar. Me duró uno mucho mucho más de Miniso.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Poca durabilidad;Los tamaños son varios y muy útiles. sin embargo se dañan rápido (ya tuve que desechar 3), por lo que se deben de tratar con ha delicadeza.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Falla;Estan buenos los cables. Empece a usar el intermedio luego luego y todo bien. El mas largo no lo use hasta como 1 mes despues y no funciona. Para entonces ya habia tirado el empaque y no podia reclamar. Los demas funcionan muy bien
3.0 out of 5 stars;Dicen que son de carag rapida pero no;Los probe con un cargador de carga rapida y no cumplieron su cometido, se me hacia mucho que por ese precio prometieran tanto, lo bueno es que traen 5 tamaños diferentes, asi que si no les interesa muchola carga rapida, como a un servidor, les pueden funcionar.
2.0 out of 5 stars;poca durabilidad;el cable funciona bien pero la durabilidad de las piezas es pesima, despues de la primera semana los cubre cables de metal se empezaron a caer y uno de los cables dejo de funcionar
4.0 out of 5 stars;Buenos por la cantidad;Son buenos pero se rompió uno
3.0 out of 5 stars;Regular;Esta bien parece ser de buena calidad pero con poco tiempo de uso los cables se les cae el forro de tela y queda expuesto
3.0 out of 5 stars;Buen cable;Esta un poco tosco y se des hila al final del cable un poco nada mas
3.0 out of 5 stars;Piezas plásticas poco resistentes;Se rompe muy fácilmente el recubrimiento plástico del conecto pero funciona a la perfección
2.0 out of 5 stars;El cable de 3m dejó de funcionar en 4 meses;Compré este paquete de cables específicamente por el cable de 3m, pero en menos de 4 meses dejó de funcionar. Es un cable que siempre está en el mismo lugar, con un uso muy ligero, nunca lo enrollé o maltraté. No lo recomiendo.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Es justo lo que se ofrece;El paquete es justo lo que se ofrece, material resistente y acepta carga rapida (Obviamente los cables mas largos tardan mas en cargar)
2.0 out of 5 stars;Estoy inconforme con el producto;El cable mas largo llego dañado y no cumple bien con su función. Por el largo del cable compre todo el SET y salió mal...
3.0 out of 5 stars;Bueno;Justo lo que necesitaba
4.0 out of 5 stars;Muy utiles;Cumplen bien su funcion
2.0 out of 5 stars;No son carga rápida.;Compré estos cables por qué tenían un buen precio, en sí los cables se sienten de buena calidad y resistentes, pero no son carga rápida, en mi dispositivo me marcaba mad bien carga lenta y me daba un aproximado de 10 horas para la carga total.  Los devolveré no valen la pena, apesar de su buen aspecto.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Funcionaron bien unos meses;despues de unos meses ya no funciona la carga rápida. Mejor comprar otro modelo.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Excelente paquete. Lo recomiendo.;Los tamaños son perfectos, dejo uno en la oficina, uno en mi cuarto y regalé dos y uno lo tengo de reserva.No se maltratan, muy buen material. Los volvería a comprar.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Malo;Por el costo no podemos pedir mucho  lamentablemente tuve la mala fortuna que todos los cables tuvieran un error al cargar y en la trasferencia de datos.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Mala calidad;Muy mala calidad, se despegó el conector, no es carga rápida, ni para huawei, ni samsung
2.0 out of 5 stars;No es de carga rápida;No sé reconoce como de carga rápida, de hecho todo lo contrario, tarda en cargar los dispositivos.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Buenos;No me ha fallado ninguno
1.0 out of 5 stars;Cables dejan de cargar rápidamente a los pocos meses;A los pocos meses de uso todos lo canales dejaron de detectar carga rápida es mejor gastar un poco más por cables de mejor calidad
2.0 out of 5 stars;No sirven para carga rápida;Por el precio están bien pero no funcionan para carga rápida
1.0 out of 5 stars;Mala calidad;De los 5 cables, solo sirve 1, y no todos funcionaron con carga rapida desde un principio, solo los cortos.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Mala calidad...;Funcionó bien los primeros días pero en menos de un mes se sacaron los hilos y ya no reconoce la carga rápida 🥺
1.0 out of 5 stars;Mala calidad;No son de calidad en cuanto a la carga, da muchos problemas, carga lenta y aveces deja de cargar.
1.0 out of 5 stars;👎;De 5 que llegaron ya se desconpusieron 3. Además no son carga rápida aunq le pongas un plug  carga rápida.Se rompen super rápido
1.0 out of 5 stars;Mal;1 cable llego dañado y los 2 más pequeños no funcionaron, sólo 2 siii trabajaron bien ... quiero solicitar un rembolso
1.0 out of 5 stars;Faltante de producto;Solo llegaron 4 de los 5 cables y ninguno se reconoce como de carga rápida en mi celular.
1.0 out of 5 stars;No duraron mucho;Me duró muy poco el cable más largo
4.0 out of 5 stars;My bad!;I didn’t think to check if it transferred data. Doesn’t. Get a Chubby Cable. It transfers data, but a bit more expensive. This cable does the job of charging and convenient if you don’t need data transmitted.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Issues with iPhone;Sometimes when you connect the charger cable to the phone and think it is charging, it is not. The iPhone adapter stops working after several days of use. In order to get it working again, you have to to a hard power reset on your phone.
4.0 out of 5 stars;I’m happy with my purchase;The price was good got 6 charging cables. Using them right now it would be nice if the magnets were stronger that’s my only complaint.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Magnetic heads only go in one way;Even though the connectors are supposed to be reversible the lightning at least only charge if inserted one way, not the other.  Considering the cost difference to make it reversible, this is garbage.  Wires are fine otherwise.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Not good for Southern States;Not good if you live in a place with black sand. Makes the chargers and usable quite quickly and hard to remove the black sand
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good cables, but know their limitations;I have ordered a few of these to cover my devices and locations.Note that they are NOT fast charging.They are not for data to your car or a computer.They also have a light to let you know they are plugged in.Periodically I get a notice on my S22 that thwre is moisture in the usb port.  I pop it out and right back in and it is fine.  Luckily it doesn't happen too often.  Other varieties do the same as it is a S22 feature to protect the device.I have had one stub  separate at the magnet making the one worthless.I like the concept and they have worked as expected.  I would have preferred an oval cable as it would work better with my case.  I used nail polish on the cables that the light was disturbing in bedroom.I have a stub in each device and leave a cable in most locations.  The car, the nightstand, on my desk, the living room, and anywhere I commonly have needed to charge a device.Overall good cables that work as expected for the price.  If I wanted to save money I'd purchase them again.Now that newer versions have been introduced that have less light on them, are oval, fast charge and pass data ,I will upgrade at some point, but these will work fine until I make the decision to change.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Ok one cord went bad;Don't know if I would buy again
3.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charging;These charge painfully slow and you may even lose charge using your phone while plugged in, but the LED is great for finding the end in a dark room and the convenience of the magnetic charger still make it good for an overnight charger at least. Though, taking the thing out of the port whenever you still want fast charging makes them kind of pointless to have.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Charge block 3.1 or higher.;Make sure you use a charging block with a value of 3.1 or higher or charging rate will be extremely slow.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Cool and easy charging connection if you don't mind waiting for a charge;I bought these for several Android style phones. The end lights really bright blue, which is cool looking but they will pretty much light the room in a blue hue in a dark room. I noticed that the charging time is greatly increased with these. On average, about 3 times longer. If you're charging overnight than it's probably not an issue. But if your expecting to be fully charged in a few hours, then these probably wont work for you. The seem sturdy and the cord seems durable and flexible, and my son uses one for his wireless headset to charge with no worries about the damaged USB C plug. They would receive 5 stars if they can increase the charging capacity and lower charge time.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Fiddly connection;I have to fiddle with the magnetic connectors to get them to charge my devices. They do charge quickly once they connect, but I have to set my phone down gently to keep that connection. Still, they're better than constantly buying standard cables that break or loosen and fall out. I'll be keeping these.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Dependability is not there;Bought this for our phones and tablets. On my generic Android tablet it works great, well it does IF you get the cord placed just right. Do not expect it to just snap to the right spot and if you bump the cord it may or may not charge. It does not work on our Android phone. no matter what we try, different tip, cord, or charger, the phone looses power
4.0 out of 5 stars;Very nice easy conect;Like it
3.0 out of 5 stars;Weak magnets. Suggest data/power cable instead.;Wish the magnets were better. You also have to make sure its placed right or else it wont charge if its not aligned properly.Waiting on some data/power cables from the same company, supposedly the magnets are better. We will see.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Weak magnetic  hold;This barely stays attached to phone. Cant move it at all or it comes free. It's ok if you charge it in a  stable area
3.0 out of 5 stars;Needs to be a stronger magnetic connection.;This product is amazing. I love nor having to keep trying to plug in my phone, especially when it's dark and I'm tired. Super easy to connect and charge. However if I answer a message or anything while phone is connected it falls off. The magnet needs to be a bit stronger for a better hold.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Wouldn't Recommend;Doesn't speed charge Galaxie Note 10+. Took over 4 hours to fully charge. I tried several ends and cords. None of them made a difference.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not c to c connections;I needed these to be c to c but they are not also won’t fit in my phone case. So I can’t use them
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works great;Charging my phone
2.0 out of 5 stars;No fast charging support and disconnect your Bluetooth;Is handy only to leave phone charging at night but dont charge fast as phone is supposed to. Disconect your Bluetooth cuz it thinks your are using cable earbuds and magnet is very weak
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not as great as before;I love how I don't have to worry about ruining the port on my tablet by my kid not paying attention to not lay the tablet on the charging end. My cat chewed threw the set I had so I bought a second one from this company because l liked how well they worked. These don't charge like the prior set did. Sure they charge when not using the device but won't help if using the device. My last set would still charge the device with use. Unfortunate because I liked this brand out of all the ones I had tried. Now I need to do more field testing to find ones that are able to do the job.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Solo me llegaron 4 cables 😒😒😒;Solo me llegaron 4 cables y no 6
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great product;I always have problem's with ports on rechargeable items. I have ruined many items, especially phone's by destroying the port by constant in and out with charging cord. This item has solved my issue! I have these little magnets in several items. All I do is attach the cord with the magnetic end and it charges without all the fuss. There is a light that lets you know the cord is working properly as well. I don't find the magnetic attachment is strong enough to pick up you phone by the cord, but it does make charging thing's much easier.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charge...have to remove phone cover;My problem with the product is I have to always remove the phone cover...annoying...
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not compatible with Apple Car Play;Great for charging but when used in a car it does not work with Apple Play.
3.0 out of 5 stars;I had really high hopes.;I really wanted these to be great. They are sturdy and look like they would not damage easily. The problem is they are slow charging and and won't stay plugged while using the phone.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Very durable and way to use.;I’m very pleased with this product. The magnets are very strong. The price is great!!
3.0 out of 5 stars;It takes to long to charge;It takes to long to charge
3.0 out of 5 stars;Cable plugs fall apart easily.;I bought the magnetic charging cables to make it easy to charge my tablet, detachable keyboard, and mouse.  The system works but after plugging and unplugging the cables less than 10 times, the USB end on a couple of the cables fell apart. I bought a cheap USB hub that I can leave the cables plugged into to prevent further damage. I don't recommend these because they are so flimsy.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great Charger;Charges fast and greatly convenient! No stress in carrying different charging cables. You have the piece you need and one cord...you're good to charge everything! I love it!
4.0 out of 5 stars;So convenient, excited to charge;I like the light up cord. 3 different lights & 3 different connectors included. Charges slow (2 hours for a full charge on a lightning usbc) pricey compared to others.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Look is great, but some issues.;The look is great. Most time wouldn't change my phone over night ( which is not convenient to find out at work for the day) everything else works good with. Only other yay nay is blue light end is always on. Which is great when finding in the dark. The rest of the wr hours in a day aren't necessary. So I keep one for things that it works on that I rotate and have on a switch. Mostly happy with.
2.0 out of 5 stars;8 month of use review;I really wanted to love these. At first, decent connection, charging speed, but no data ability. Okay I can deal with that. Months later the magnetic connection is weak, and charging is randomly super slow. I'll connect my phone, plugged into a 3a fast charger, and it'll say 1 hour to full. Okay cool that's normal. Randomly, from 30 seconds later to 1 hour later, it'll change to super slow trickle charging and often won't charge my phone over night to full.This is random, I've tried changing cables, adapters, does it on 5 different phones, 2 or 3 different tablets, playstation controllers, you name it. The magnets get so weak over time it barely stays on when your'e holding your phone with it connected.I like the idea, but it needs alot more refinement. I wish I'd waited before I bought several packs of these and changed the whole house and office to these cables, not at all happy with them.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Looks good in the ad;These charge things well for a few days .  Then everything Plugged into them cause the slow charging notice to come up. Not worth the price paid for them.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Cool BUT!?;First I like the idea of this product and it works for charging.  My idea was that I could use it for my truck and utilize  ANDROID auto.  The data will not transfer thus making this product useless to me.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Built to last...just long enough that you can't return them.;I really want to love these TOPK chargers. In fact I do love them...while they work. I've given them a very fair try, ordering 3 packs since spring of 2020, but the truth is that these are just junk, destined to remain in the landfill after a mere few weeks use. My first purchase, the cords shorted out or broke within months. I avoided buying again until March of 2021, where I got a red 6 pack. By September, one functioning cord remained, so I thought I'd try one more time. Of the pack I bought in mid September, the one on which I'm writing this review, 3 cords remain. The USB side that goes into the plug is flimsy and will snap clean off at the first sign of pressure. Shorts are literally inevitable. One of the longest cords I had to throw away straight out of the pack as it wasn't working at all. The super short one had the USB part snap off. The other really long one as of 10 minutes ago stopped working. Now it's just a matter of time for the rest, I'm sure. While the magnetic charging is great for saving my charging ports, and convenient for charging all my devices, unfortunately TOPK ain't it. Look elsewhere for magnetic chargers if you want them to last longer than it took you to read this review.
5.0 out of 5 stars;These actually work!;I was skeptical after reading a few of the negative reviews. I have an autistic son who is in a hurry to do everything and is not the gentlest when it comes to charging cables. I wanted something with more give and the breakaway feature is really nice.I ordered a set for myself as well and I use them in my cars. I have to admit it's nice to be able to switch between USB C/ Lightning/ Mini Usb with the same cord. It's definitely worth the money.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not a good connection;These are cords are not very good. They have a weak connection. For example, when first connected, my tablet will say it has 3 hours until fully charged. If you bump it or look at it wrong, it will say 11 hours until fully charged. I can't count on it.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Very nice easy to use;Very nice. Add a convenient easy way to charge your devices.  I don't like the light.  To bright if used in a nightstand at night. Other than that they are very nice practical way to charge devices
3.0 out of 5 stars;nice idea but real slow charging;these are a great idea, because i have had phone charging port issues with the last couple phones  MOIST PORT ALERT!but these cables are dreadfully slow charging.  are all magnetic cables the same slow charging?
2.0 out of 5 stars;Extra slow charging;I am very disappointed in the extra slow charging speed. The magnet is not very strong and if you are moving the device slightly the charging wire will disconnect and fall off. Also the blue light does not come off and stays on for as long as the usb is plugged in. Definitely won't buy again.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Easy to use;The magnet cannot hold a 7oz phone upside down. The charge is not fast charging so a low battery will take 4 hrs to fully charge note 10 specifically. Also not accessable with android auto. There is no cube with this order so have cubes avaliable. The cord is durable even if a kid trips over it while plugged in it wont cause damage.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Fantastic Charging System!;Love these chargers. Comes with a fantastic ammount of adapters. Keep in mind without Data imputs fast charge will not worke. This is great if your trying to prolo the life of your phone and device batteries but also have an easy way to plug your device in anytime, any where. I also have these in the car to make chargine safer and easer.
4.0 out of 5 stars;It is an ok product;Be careful dropping your phone cause the metal magnet piece likes to pop off which is why I had to buy more..
3.0 out of 5 stars;Great idea, poor execution;IOS connector needs to be installed one way only.  It will only charge on one side.Charges pretty slow. Will not rapid charger my Android phone.Magnet is pretty weak.  If you don't watch out and your connection is crooked, your phone will not charge.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Very slow charging;Charging is very slow
4.0 out of 5 stars;Well made cords, 1 of the 3 was a dud;One of the 3 cords stopped charging my phone after just 2 weeks of use. The other two cords worked great for over a year, I used one in my car & the other in my room. They are sturdy, durable, & well made. Disappointing that the 1 cord went bad so quickly, but I honestly only needed 2 cords anyway.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Muy buena;
4.0 out of 5 stars;I will need more to promote it;I showed it to many people at work and they are wanting to buy some.  This is the best type of chords so far and easy to handle without pulling it from the wall.  I’m glad I invest in this and gave a few to my colleagues.
4.0 out of 5 stars;I love the one's that I bought.;Use them in my house and on five different vehicles. Love the short ones for the truck and motorcycles. Only reason I gave it only 4 overall, convinced one of my coworkers to get some, slower charging than he'd hoped and one sparked on him pretty bad when he was connecting. :/
4.0 out of 5 stars;Easy and quick to connect.;The cables are very durable and the lengths are just right.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't stay on well. Slow charging rather than super fast charging.;It's slow charging. If it even charges if it's attached right. Weak magnet. did not do super charged charging with my USB plug.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Poor product;I had this product for around a week and the first magnet quit working, plus it was super easy for my phone to come off charge.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Fast Charging does not last indefinitely;The fast charging capabilities seem to only last for 12 months after which fast charging capabilities are no longer functional for some reason.  Also it is not compatible with ANY Samsung A series phone I tried it on A30, A50, and A10 and it does not charge at all.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Less reliable than thought;Found that the charging tip that goes into the device's port was less reliable in maintaining connection inside the device, thus wasn't charging.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Decent charging cable, but not great;A bit disappointed.  I bought these as they mentioned they were 3A.  I compared all 3 cables to an Anker cable that was NOT 3A and used a Samsung Fast Adaptive charger.  The Anker easily register over 2400mA, while your cables did not even reach 1800mA  Nowhere on your packaging does it mention 3A, so not even sure if that is what you sent.  It still was a good deal as 3 cables for $10 so I do plan on keeping, but will use another manufacturer when chargers of 25-45w to charge the Note 10+ are available from a variety of manufacturers.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works great;Little cheaper too easy to unattach
3.0 out of 5 stars;Open box review;I haven't tried the actual product yet so this will only be base on the the initial open box review.The box that it came in with looks as though it should be bigger and the cords doesn't exactly fit in it nicely. I thought the velcro fasteners were attached to the cords but it wasn't. It also seems to have a design flaw to it, I'm not sure how to use the hole? It can only fit through the small part of the straps but if you were to wrap it around it just doesn't make sense to put it through.
3.0 out of 5 stars;magnetic cables;I two connectors break and one cable failed. I like the easy connection but would buy different brand.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Save your money;Everything was fine at first I hooked him up the magnets work great and then I realize about after a week they started to not work slowly one by one they stopped working. They have a light on them to show you when they're working and they've all stopped.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Easy to use;Love the idea of these. Bought several for all things electronic that need to be plugged in. Unfortunately my daughter went to unplug her phone and it broke off. Luckily we were able to get the small insert out of the phone. These are great and easy to use. They hook right up. Kids were ruining the cables and usb ports cause just jamming them in there. Now dont have that problem.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Type c USB cable;Thought I already reviewed these. So here goes again , nice brite red so you can find them. Charges my phone with a fast charger fast. Long enough so you don't have to be right on top of the outlet.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Cool idea, poor execution;Only used the product for two weeks and the first cord stopped working. The charge time wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. Magent was very weak, I dropped my phone several times because of this. Disappointed it didn't work well for me maybe someone else makes a better one.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Love the idea, but it's a poorly made cable;I absolutely loved using this as a charger for my devices for the first 2 or 3 weeks, but it didn't take long for the cord to just stop charging... or it would for a second in the right spot then stop again.... I tried switching the connecting tip on my phone, but even with new tip it still wouldn't charge. I started using one of the other cords and it worked but I'll be returning before this one breaks on me too. However I will miss how long the cords were and the convince of the magnet.Also wouldn't recommend for anyone with a bulky case to get this because the connector sticks out quite a bit and it might not work with some cases.
3.0 out of 5 stars;It looks great , but not what I was looking for.;I am not able give an honest review due to me not using it.
5.0 out of 5 stars;quality;perfect
3.0 out of 5 stars;Love it But only works on One Device;This is a beautifully designed and well thought out product. Unfortunately, it doesn't work on Ipad Pro or Macbook Pro. Will work on other Ipads and Macs.  Otherwise, I would have given it 10 Stars
3.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't work for Samsung galaxy A52 5G..;Won't charge
2.0 out of 5 stars;Won’t charge iPad mini 6th gen;Worked great on my 5th gen iPad mini but barely can charge my 6th gen iPad mini. Sometimes it works most of the time it wouldn’t. Tried different cables, heads, outlets chargers, etc…Finally gave up and am using a normal usb c cable. I’ll miss them.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Useless and harmful to your phone port;I got this thinking that it would protect my phone in case I dropped it while it was plugged in or it would make charging more convenient. However, this has many problems. My phone indicates it's not getting the full charge. Secondly, it's really difficult to unplug it from the phone because it's really jammed in. Lastly, after I used this and went back to a regular cord, now the new phone says that even my old cord isn't charging correctly (which it did charge correctly before using this product). And the magnet isn't strung enough to keep it connected to itself especially if you're looking at the phone sideways.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good for casual use, not for working from car;I bought these to use while doing UberEats. The app drains my battery faster than this cord can keep up. It works perfect though if you don't use such draining apps regularly.
1.0 out of 5 stars;The product has a terrible quality;It worked fine the first month but then it stopped charging, I didn't make any claims because I thought it was bad luck so I used another cable but the magnet came off after 1 month, I used another cable and after 2 weeks it stopped charging, they did not give me a guarantee.
4.0 out of 5 stars;One broke;These are super tough and I like the color choice, but my son did find a way to break one.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Great concept, fails and execution;It’s a fantastic concept, and if the magnets were stronger it would be fantastic. However you practically have to tape them together, the magnet and the pieces that plug into your device or otherwise they simply disconnect. As versatile as it could be, it’s a little too much trouble.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great product;Product was exactly as I expected…speedy delivery
2.0 out of 5 stars;Poor quality product.;Magnetic connection is weak and the cords do not allow for a fast charge. My phone sat on the charger for 8 hours and was still only at 77%.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Looks good;Works like they should. Look and feel durable. Time will tell. Worth the price so far
1.0 out of 5 stars;Misleading photos;It's only usb c on one end. Usb A on the other. Notice that none of their photos show the cable end to end. There are plenty of other made in China cables like this one at half the price. Skip this one.Update. Figure I save these for my folks who's got several devices. They have 2 Samsung tabs and they have 2 phones. Of the 4 devices only 1 of the tablet would charge up. The other 3 would not charge at all.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Easy to use;Positive phone charging system. Iighted cables make finding cae easy. Good quality.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Best Chargers that I’ve ever purchased.;These are great
2.0 out of 5 stars;No dice on my Samsung S20;Great Idea but I can't get it to work on my phone
1.0 out of 5 stars;Did not work;Did not work on charging my wife and mine's LG cell phones.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Built well but still won't last;Beat my expectations! Good and sturdy but not super stiff like some other really rigid cables.******6 MONTH UPDATE**********After six months only 1 of 3 continue to work. My wife and I had these in our bedroom and only use them to charge over night. I've tried most brands, anker, amazon and generic and they all fail eventually. nothing beats a real OEM samsung but they are too short! Not so much bang for my buck after all.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Excellent charging cords!;This cord is great! I purchased a few extra connectors and use them on phones, tablets, even my gaming headset. Strong magnets,  and fast charge time.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Dosen't fit type C;I purchased it for.my new phone.The USB c would not stay in any of my USB c devices
4.0 out of 5 stars;Is not a fast charge;Dose not really charge fast as I assumed
2.0 out of 5 stars;stopped working in less than a year;Used all 3 cables over 8 monthes - one 2stopped working, one stopped working well (not QC 3) and the other one is still working. For 8 months this seems ok - I would prefer they would have made it at least one year!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Easy to find;The red color makes the cord easy to find and to distinquish from other cords.  The length is great, the slightly wirey cord makes storage easy and it charges really fast.  Great purchase.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Definitely will buy again if they ever break;So far these have held up for a couple months, I've had a cord break in a week. Great price for three cords, gave one to a friend and she's had no issues either.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Weak magnet;Magnet not nearly as strong as I would like.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Wobble a little.;Very cheap. Wobble a little.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Just dont;First off its going to take over 5 hours to charge my Samsung Note 10 plus from 25%.Also the magnetic connection is very weak.  I'd barely move the phone and it would tip off its charger.This is not my first magnetic charger rodeo, my other one was great but I needed more plugs and my old charger was out of stock.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Very low powered, needs to be connected overnight to charge anything.;These cables are of such poor quality that the charger needs to be connected overnight to charge anything.So little power is transferred by these cables that your battery will drain while plugged in if you attempt to use the phone while charging.During the first use it took 1/2hr to increase charge by 2%
5.0 out of 5 stars;Cant go wrong with these.;These chargers are my favorite. I have bought a different brand and they didn't hold up as well. These work just as well as Samsungs and last longer.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Does not quick charge;This cable does not support quick charge on my Google pixel with a quick charging block.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Dont accidentally drop;Fell from bathroom counter to floor and ports fell off.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Product works, advertisements are misleading;I was under the impression that these cables had the magnetic connectors at both ends, this is not the case. There are no pictures or description indicating that these cables include USB type A, there is only images of the magnetic tips
2.0 out of 5 stars;Does not fast charge, even with QC 3.0;"These do NOT ""fast charge"" my galaxy S9 with either the quick charge adapter nor the QC 3.0 adapter I purchased just for these.  My old cords show as ""fast charge"" and these do not.  I purchased these because they were longer."
2.0 out of 5 stars;Right angle adapter didn't work;While the straight connector worked well, the 90 degree angle connector didn't work at all.  Pins and length of cords were fine.  Since only one of the two cables worked, best I could rate this was 2 star.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't not work with Google pixel phones;NOT universal USB C
1.0 out of 5 stars;Sparks;I’ve had these for a little while but in the last month when I go plug my phone in there are sparks. This is not a safe product. I stoped using!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Weak charging for newer devices;"With my fold 3 and wife's Motorola Stylo 2021, neither would set to ""fast""charge with these cables. The power bricks were well able and do great charge with any of these cables. Basically, unusable and waste of money."
1.0 out of 5 stars;Misleading Pictures. Useless for USBC to USBC.;If you want USB C to USB C this is not for you.1. Photos show what appears to be 2 ends of a cable. One angled with a magnetic adapter. One straight with a magnetic adapter. Not the case. It's 2 cables, one in each configuration.2. Photos don't show one end is USB A the other is USB C. The description does not mention USB A, only USB C.3. Useless with any MacBook Pro purchased in the past 3 years.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good cables good price;Only had for a few days, but to this point seem great. Connection is very snug & frim
5.0 out of 5 stars;Nice size, durable;These chords are a good length of you need to use your phone while it's charging
1.0 out of 5 stars;Works well but was short 2 cables.;The description says it includes 6 cables but it only had 4. Very disappointed. Will return. Will adjust review if the problem is resolved.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Disappointment;They worked great for 2 weeksAfter 2 weeks they stopped charging and any device I used them for gave me error messages.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Won't last;Been little over a year and two of these cables have failed. It's not like they were getting a lot of use. Both were just plugged in at a coffee table to be used when sitting by the table.They initially work well but don't last,  cannot recommend
1.0 out of 5 stars;Did not work on my Adroid Verizon Galaxie;The cables are thin compared to my old magnetic cables.Very strong magnet. All other as per description, except did not work on my Verizon Galaxy Android. Not strong enough to charge. See photo.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Disconnects easily;The concept of having a magnetic attach is nice, but takes very low force to disconnect.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Se dañan demasiado rápido;Los conectores se dañan muy rápido y esto hace que económicamente no sea rentable, la idea es buena pero con mala calidad
1.0 out of 5 stars;DO NOT BUY THIS!!!  IT FRIED MY iPad;DO NOT BUY THIS...THE CORD HEATED UP REAL FAST AND FRIED MY iPAD IN A SPLIT SECOND.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Cords went bad quickly;Three cords went bad rather quickly. Should  last at least a year or more.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Cheap garbage;CHEAP GARBAGE. Do not buy this. The magnets can’t even stay together when you take the charger off your phone so you have to fish the cap off. Not worth it
1.0 out of 5 stars;no sirve para cargar , ninguno de mis celulares;lo compré y no carga Xiaomi redmi note 7 , ni ome plus Nord n10 , ni las powebanks
1.0 out of 5 stars;Nearly burned my house down.;0/10 do not recommend due to being a fire hazard.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Bad connection;Several times in the morning after charging all night my phone was dead.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Great product but……;Just bought this and a gen 3.  I did not see anywhere that Said gen 3 is not backward compatible. Only reason for the 1 star
1.0 out of 5 stars;You're throwing your money away;Cables quit charging in less than a year on my S9.Can plug my factory short cable into same charger and it does great.These cables are pure garbage. Literally going into the garbage can.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Pay the extra couple dollars to get a better one;They all broke in less than a month
2.0 out of 5 stars;They fit Samsung Galaxy good;They don't fit in the ZTE ZMax tight enough to charge
1.0 out of 5 stars;They did not charge our androids.;They are supposed to support androids. They didn't charge at all for either of our phones
1.0 out of 5 stars;Can't charge a Galaxy Z Flip;Complete waste of money. Won't charge my Galaxy Z Flip at all.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not that good;Medal part bent the first week
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not  reliable;After 3 months of use the cable won't stay connected to phone. You plug it in and it says it's charging but after a little while it will stop sometimes you get 10% sometimes you get 50% sometimes you get no charge.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Fast charging;Same speed with original charger
1.0 out of 5 stars;These aren't fast charge cables;I'm returning these, they are slow charge cables, not fast charge cables.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not worth it;All three charging cables broke with in 3 weeks. From the C post bending (no force was applied), to the whole thing becoming unbraided, then finally one just stopped working. Never will I ever again buy these.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Temporary Fix;Doesn't last long.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not Worth the money;You did not charge my iPhone or iPad.
1.0 out of 5 stars;The magnets are weak and disconnect easily!;Very disappointed in the cords. Magnets are easily separated which is opposite of the advertising.  Would give 5 stars for stronger magnets!
1.0 out of 5 stars;TRASH SAVE YOUR $$$;Stopped working completely after about a week.Didn't work right before that. Connection issues.Connects and disconnects immediately. This is a gimmick... a gizmo.Get a real cord. This thing is a waste of $ and time.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charge;Slow charge
1.0 out of 5 stars;The tips don't fit into the charger port;Even there were many tips, none fitted for my phone
1.0 out of 5 stars;Only worked for a couple days.;Verrrry slow charging in the few days that it worked.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Garbage! Don't buy. Burnt out in two months;Garbage! It only lasted two months of use. Do not buy.
1.0 out of 5 stars;wear out quick;They don't last long at all in daily use
1.0 out of 5 stars;After a while it no longer holds into the phone.;After a while it no longer holds into the phone.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Syuch Garbage;Dont waste your time or money on these
1.0 out of 5 stars;Complete waste.;All 3 of these chargers broke within a week of using.
1.0 out of 5 stars;No sirve para iPad Pro;El conector tipo C no sirve para apad pro !!!!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Terrible product;Terrible product not worth your money
1.0 out of 5 stars;Never worked.  Returned for a 2nd set & they never worked.;Did not work.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Bad;The cable charges very slowly.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Never again.;Poor. Didn't last very long.
3.0 out of 5 stars;The charging provided is lame;Stay away. Don't buy.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Alright;These chargers are ok. Nothing special. They are not fast chargers for my Note 10. But they're pretty cool.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not very durable;They started working well but quickly stopped working. They all bent at the same place, where you plug it into the phone.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works great and charges quick;So some posits are saying that the charge power is laughably slow but mine is working at at least 2a with a given device. I know this because the battery pack is warming up more than on my slower charging brick. The package includes various cords at different lengths so it’s nice to have options with lengths. The material feels like it will last.Big thing to remember is this is supposed to be the non data transfer cable. I have not tested it but I doubt they would lie about the listing. I’m very pleased with this cable. Will probably end up buying a data cable so I can use my phone with car play and Then it would be a perfect cable solution.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Intermittent operation;Several of the six cords we received would only work intermittently.  You’d plug them in everything would be fine.  Then you’d go away and come back later and blue led light that shows they are working and the device would still be uncharged.  Could never figure out what problem was.  I checked the wall socket and the iphone charger module.  All fine.  They would do the same thing when plugged into my car usb port.The magnetic connection wasn’t that strong. and could become dissconnected if you picked it up, connected the cord, and then set it down wrong.  The cord wouldn’t always come physically disconnected, but would slide just enough to stop charging.The blue led light built into the cord to show it was working was a major annoyance at night in the bedroom.  Way too bright.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Slowww charge;Does what it says, but very slow changing. Plus, led at end of cable very bright, not good for use in bedroom at night.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Review only after a month..;Reserve your reviews until after a month..These were super great at first until off course it stopped charging, at least not without squeezing the magnets together.. I wouldn't say that I used them heavily either..seems like an inferior product.. would not recommend
2.0 out of 5 stars;Great for slowly watching your phone die;The entire addition of magnetic components is creating a problem and then trying to solve it, but failing.
4.0 out of 5 stars;They're average.;They last for a while, and then simply stop working. Or, will only charge any search position, or won't fast charge.However, for the amount paid and time they last, I think it's worthwhile.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Best USB Type C cords;These chargers work very well. My whole family were fighting over them, so I had to buy more. We loved these charging cords.
2.0 out of 5 stars;didn't last long;less than a year, little use in the kitchen. now dead.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Now I don’t end up with so many broken cables;This is my second order of TOPK magnetic charging cables.  I got more to share with my son and husband and to put in different areas of the house.  I haven’t had to buy new cables because they broke since I got these.  Plus I had read and article about plugging and unplugging cables puts wear and tear on the device plug in and can cause problems with charging the device.  Since you can leave the little plug adapter in you don’t have that issue.  For me they are an all around win.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Won't stay connected;These started out great but went downhill fast. They don't stay connected. I attach my phone to my laptop often but with these cables I can barely breath and I have to re-connect.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Broke from normal use;If you want junk, then buy these
1.0 out of 5 stars;NOT for iphone;The listing doesn't make this clear, but these are not iphone (lightening) cords. I received them, but have no use for them.
4.0 out of 5 stars;worked great easy to use;love them so much bought more.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Bad connection;These work great if you are just going to throw the charger on your device and leave it alone but doesn't work well when you're holding your device the charger will consistently disconnect and reconnect.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Immediate shipping;Quick shipping, and seem to work well-I tested them all. Can't comment on durability yet. But the advertised cord lengths were WAY off! Instead of 1ft ,3ft, 3ft, 6ft, 6ft, 10ft I received 20in, 40in, 40in, 80in, 81in, 10ft.  I guess one out of six ain't bad, and they were all over the stated length, but the 1 ft. length was the one I really needed. Precision and accuracy seem to have ridden the same train to oblivion as punctuality, ethics and discretion. I must be getting old.

5.0 out of 5 stars;How they work;Phone charger
4.0 out of 5 stars;strong and quality;ok. I like the nylon cord and strong magnets. the Fast charging is only on the short cord. I do believe the others are just too long to conduct fast charging. So, they are useless. poo! which is why I gave 4stars. It is a conundrum.  I purchased a battery backup, which allows me to use the short cord. I do wish the side port cord was on a shorter cord, would be great for game play. So, as my suggestion,  please make a side port a short cord, the pack comes with 2 long.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good quality!;This is not for the new generations of phones charge very slowly but work great on diferents old models and some other productsEste producto no trabaja bien cargando la carga es lentisima en telefonos de alta gama pero en modelos anteriores si funciona bien y otros articulos que no requieran carga rapida oh de mayor salida
5.0 out of 5 stars;Nice and strong and fast charging.;Almost as fast as my original charger. Just 3 percent slower. But it work perfectly and still charges faster than all other charging cords I have. This is only test from the longest 10 feet cord. The shorter cords charge as fast as the original I think.  I was no difference.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great combo;Finally a product does include many tips.
4.0 out of 5 stars;We’ll made bag;Lightweight bag, well made. Got it for my Panasonic FZ300 and it fits with lens facing sideways, kinda tightly. Love side pouches that zip as you won’t loose anything, but with the FZ300 being tight you can’t fit a lot in the side pockets. Ordered the 306 to try.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Does the job;I am not worried about my camera getting damaged while it’s in the case. It has pockets on the sides which are nice and another zipper pocket on the inside of the flap that opens up.I think this is a good basic case but if you’re bringing more cables or any extra equipment, this is not big enough to fit them. It’s really just big enough for a camera, some batteries, and maybe a cable or two.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Case is great zipper only lasted 8 months;Bought the same case many years ago.  It lasted till beginning of this year.  Loved the case it stood up to may years of hiking and photo taking.  Just got worn out from use and age.  Bought a new one to replace it in April 2022.  Dec. 2022 the zipper broke.  The teeth on one corner separated leading to the the pull to fall off.  Can not get it back on track.  I did not force or yank on the zipper pull to cause it to fall apart.  Nor was I over stuffing the case.  Disappointed because the other one lasted for so many years thought this one would survive as long.  Guess not.  Like everything else about the case but without the zipper it isn't much good.
5.0 out of 5 stars;The Adventure Ends and the Spoils are !!!AWESOME!!!;"This bag had quite an adventure getting to me, it all started months ago. I first saw it as part of an advertizement here on Amazon when clicked on would take you to a page a Christmas specials and when I first laid eyes on it I thought, ""oooo cute must be mine!"" After much searching after clicking on the advertizement itself, I came up empty handed. Not wanting to give up I emailed Amazon to see if they would come up with the name of the company that makes the bag. Long story short, they couldn't and told me that it was a product they didn't sell which was weird because they're Amazon. I took a break then on day saw a smaller bag with the yellow square on it (link to said bag show in link click on link to see. http://www.amazon.com/Case-Logic-CPL-104-Camera-Holster/dp/B009PKNMGA/) and thought I've seen that yellow square before. I soon found out that my beloved cute little bag was by Case Logic and once and easily locating it on Amazon, ordered it. Now I know it can take some time for some items to get to me I will wait as long as it takes but this time it's was taking longer than advertized. I waited a few more days before contacting the seller and they promptly refunded me my money which was fine but I really wanted the bag. Turns out, it was lost in the mail. Oh and by the by, if you do have items lost in the mail never to come to you all of those items end up in Atlanta, look to Google for more information.Fast forward to a year later and I'm at work looking as the bag I never got on Amazon then saw how cheap it now was a just reordered it right then. It is now Monday, I ordered it on Thursday and it is not in my possession. I love it, it is sooo cute exactly as I had envisioned it. I will never fault the company or anyone else for my items being lost forever, Fate is just funny that way, it was not meant to be mine back then. Now that I have it I am so happy. I give it five stars because it came exactly as advertized, it super cute and will hold my cell phone perfectly. Instead I give out advice:1. If you have an item lost in the mail look to the Atlanta Lost Mail Auction. If you contact them and describe what you lost I am 100% sure they will have it there.2. Before putting items in your cart, look from where the item is coming from and how many days it will take to get to you via their estimate. Just because it is the cheapest doesn't mean it will fly to you, it may take a month and you HAVE to be okay with that.3. Stop writing bad reviews if you don't get your item, it's not the sellers fault if it's lost in the mail, write the review only after you get it. A review is only for the product itself not for everything that happens around it.  Does it look as it was advertized, how good of a quality is it etc, etcI hope my review helps a lot of people, this is a great little bag and even if it doesn't, I still love the bag any way. :-)"
4.0 out of 5 stars;Bien;Buena calidad aunque un poco pequeño
4.0 out of 5 stars;tight but just right for my Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ1000;"I originally bought this from a seller called GizGalaxy.  I waited for like two weeks and after a few emails with no return emails from them during the final days of the delivery estimated because my item wasn't shipped yet they finally emailed back just to be told that they canceled my order because it was out of stock.  GizGalaxy is a horrible seller with horrible customer service.  I can't leave them seller feed back because they canceled my order so I can't find the option to give them feed back.  Anyway, luckily this was in stock from Amazon and it was cheaper.  So I jumped on it and I was surprised how fast they got it to me since I don't even have prime.I'm really happy with this bag.  I originally put my DMC-FZ1000 face down with the camera straps on top but trying to take it out was kinda of a hassle because it's really tight inside.  So I placed it side ways with the grip facing upwards.  This was better because I could grab it from the grip and pull it out from the top of this small bag.  The lens hood is attached and facing the camera and it fits in this position.  I could put two back up batteries with extra space to put another battery or something as small on one side zipper pouch and a smaller car battery charger with car adapter wire on the other side.  I tried to put the original Lumix charger but it was really pushing it to the max that the zipper started looking like it was going to break.  I could put a few SD cards AND maybe USB wires in the zipper slot inside the main compartment.  You could probably place them at the place where a charger should go but I probably won't put anything there since there's no zippers so it could fall off, so I guess I'll just use that as extra protection for the camera.I like the bag straps, they're adjustable and it swivels for more mobility. The bag seems to be made with quality but I wish it was at least water resistance.  Maybe I could spray it to be water resistance.  I could probably use the back ""handle"" and put a very portable small tripod or monopod but I think I could somehow use straps to put it on one of my backpack with molle straps.  I wanted to put my action camera inside but there no room for anything else.  But overall that's what it's made for, it's just for my bridge camera and a few accessories.  Great small, tight, get priced bag for my camera.Edit:  after seeing other smaller but more spacious bags, I may end up getting that instead.  I recently bought an external flash so I want something as small but could fit my stuff.  I saw this bag and other branded bags at a retail store and I realized there are better options.  But till then this bag is still really nice.  I mean this is my first time searching or a bag like this and now I know there are better options."
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect fit for my Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ300;I needed a lightly padded bag for just my camera to put into a dry bag and take with me paddling. I wanted something to fit just the camera, and ideally also an extra battery and a spare memory card. It had to have a top zipper and allow me to load the camera in sideways with the grip up. This bag is exactly all those things and I'm so glad!I need quick access to my camera when I am kayaking or paddle boarding, and so needed a small padded bag that would fit into a small 5L roll top dry bag (the stiff kind that stands open on its own). I open the dry bag when I want to shoot photos and then quickly put the camera back in and close up the dry bag when I'm done. I didn't want to have to mess with a weird opening on the camera bag or even have to zip it closed. I just tested my system and I'm super pleased. Hopefully it will hold up well.If you also have this camera, be aware that you have to stow the lens hood on the lens. You can't leave it extended and still fit the camera in this bag. I never like leaving a lens hood on in the in-use position anyway when I pack away a camera since doing that can put forces on the lens that over time might cause damage - especially if you aren't going to baby the bag the camera is stored in.
3.0 out of 5 stars;“It barley works for my purpose”;So basically I got my first camera, and with that I needed a way to store it. So I bought this under priced camera bag thinking it would be as high quality as the ratings. But I was wrong, my camera which I had got was a decent sized camera LUMIX DMC-FZ-30. It was BARLEY big enough to fit inside. My battery charger did not fit until I forced it in. I literally could not put any of my other lenses inside. So I could only bring the camera by itself when I used it to take a photo. by the way my camera has a fixed lens so I mean a(n) extension that I could add like a wide angle lens or a lens protector. All in all this camera bag is good for photographers that have small cameras. The camera bag is what you payed for it.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Fits my LUMIX DMC-FZ70, Plus Its Accessories;Although this isn't the nicest camera case/bag I've owned, it certainly is the best for the price.  My Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ70 fits snugly inside with room still left foran extra battery, SD cards, my wall charger, a car key fob, and even my iPhone 6.  Of course, adding those extra things make for a tight fit since the bag itself isn't much bigger than the camera.The interior of the bag has a main compartment and a padded secondary pocket that can expand/contract depending on how large the camera is.  My iPhone 6 slips easily into this secondard section.  The interior top flap has a zippered pocket that's large enough for a spare battery and an SD card.  On the exterior, the case has two side pockets, one of which I use for my wall charger (it's a tight fit) and the other for my key fob.  It comes with an adjustable shoulder strap that fastens on using plastic clips.  If you're a wear-your-case-on-your-belt type, the back has a pass-through. the only way the case would come off is if you removed your belt.  The top has a small handle.Only a couple of things about this case made me deduct a star from my rating:  the plastic clips (I've had plastic clips break on me). the shoulder strap doesn't rotate on its clips, so you must take care to clip it in the correct direction. the strap is not padded.  These are all minor issues, and they don't impact the functionality of the case.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
4.0 out of 5 stars;Exceptional Value, Suits All of my Camera Needs;"I am thoroughly impressed with the value in this camera bag. It exemplifies the ""Everything you need, nothing you dont"" philosophy, and for the money (I got it on sale at an excellent price) I have to say this is a stellar buy. It holds my Nikon P530, two extra batteries, a LensPen, and I usually stick a Yi Action Camera (a GoPro knock off, but the same size and a Hero 5) in the side pocket with an extra batter for that, and it holds everything comfortably and securely. I find that build quality so far has been perfectly adequate, though admittedly I haven't abused it much. For the negatives, I feel there are just a few, which are not in any way deal breakers and should be expected for such a value oriented bag. Firstly, these are not at all water resistant, forget water proof. It never states that they are, but they are, if I may, almost spongy. Even being in contact with my body, it absorbs my sweat and I see the inside will be moist, not great for a camera. The second negative, again, in perspective it is completely acceptable for this price point, is that the padding is good but not great. Your camera would not survive a fall from much height, but tossing it on the table or riding in a backpack it serves just fine. I give this product 4 stars because it completely fills it's role, does everything it should and purports to do, but it doesn't get 5 stars simply because my ratings only give 5 stars when an item is truly exceptional in all fields and delivers way over expectations. In short, I recommend this product to anyone considering it."
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not a fast charger;It charges… kinda like a Tesla on 110v. It is slower than my old Apple branded charger that came with my series 2 watch. Primary use is on Series 7 and Series 5 watches so if it was a fast charger, they would be able to handle it. No luck. But it does charge in the end.
4.0 out of 5 stars;IT FITS MY SUPERZOOM Nikon P510! However...;"YES! It fits my Nikon P510 ""Superzoom"" camera, as well as a couple of extra batteries and the USB cable... and the bag is not enormous, which is nice.However... the padding, especially in the bottom of the bag, is a little light (I want my camera to be protected!) - I'll be adding some fabric-wrapped neoprene or closed-cell foam in the bottom of the bag.Also, while I can fit the very basic necessities in the bag and the two small side pockets, there definitely is no EXTRA room in the bag.NOTE: I haven't used this item enough to rate the durability over time, but in my experience CaseLogic has stood the test of time.PROS:Designed to go on a belt or be carried with a handle or worn on a shoulder strap (provided) - I appreciate the flexibility and security of this design.The zippered camera compartment opens from the back - actually a very smart design - I like this very much!Two small zippered side pockets have an interior mesh and elastic ""retainer"" pocket to keep what's important, in the bagCONS:There's not enough padding, especially in the bottom of the bagThe side pockets are not quite large enough to carry my accessories. would have been nice to have mesh ""pockets"" in both sides of the pocket compartmentsThe shoulder strap attachment seems somewhat flimsy (though it has not broken) and is narrow.Summary:The price point was about right (inexpensive) for the bag and my camera fits (the bag I purchased with the camera as a package did NOT fit).I'm happy with my purchase, however, I'd be willing to pay slightly more for a similar bag with slightly larger side pockets, an additional zippered pocket on the bottom or back of the bag and a little more padding."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Too tight for Fuji HS 30/20 etc.;The Fujifilm HS30 EXR (and HS20 EXR) accept 58mm lense filters. The side pockets on the Case Logic DCB-304 are too small to cary a bunch of filters. The camera fits so tight that I can barely get my fingers in to remove the camera from the case(I fear I will accidently push a button or smudge the screen). For this camera a better case would be a Case Logic TBC-306. The camera fits perfectly. The case has more padding and the pockets are large enough to hold a few filters, spare memory cards, spare battery, cords, and lense cleaning equipment. Another case that fits better is the Lowepro Rezo TLZ 10. It is the smalest case I have found that will fit this camera (inexpensive too). The Lowepro Rezo TLZ 10 has only one pocket. If you travel light and don't cary all the stuff I do, I consider it to be an excelent choice. It has a clasp to hold the cover down (rather than noisy velcro). All of these cases have a few things in common. They all have a belt loop and open from the top. I like to wear the case on my hip, like a holster. The distance the case protrudes from my hip is critical (it is easy to wack it on things you are walking past). All of these cases have minimal bulk. I had a Tamrac case. It held my Fuji HS20 EXR and my stuff. I liked that the top covered the whole bag and was held down using a clasp (like the lowepro above). But, all of the storage space was on the front of the bag, making it very bulky and cumbersome when carying it on my hip. I prefer the side pockets on the Case Logic TBC-306... Just wish it had a clasp instead of velcro.
3.0 out of 5 stars;DCB-304 Hybrid case overall decent;Case logic dcb-304, i would say is a case that is primarily meant for compact point and shoot cameras. The case is smaller than it looks in pictures, which can be a positive or negative feature depending on your needs. For me i needed a minimalist case, so small was a feature that was necessary but this might have been just i little bit too small. I bought this for a Oly micro 4/3 camera which is about the same size as a sony eos-m, nex, (practically a compact in size). However, the case is quite small to fit extra accessories such as charger+cord. The side pockets with mesh nets are almost useless in my opinion. the sides are not sewed/designed to flare out when items are placed inside. When items are placed in side-pockets, it pushes inward toward the camera side walls, leaving you less space for the main compartment and pushing sidewalls towards your camera. side-pockets will barely fit a 3ft folded usb cord if your camera and other accessories are full in the main compartment. I would see that the pockets are good for small singular items such as extra camera batteries.As for the inside top-zipper pocket, i found its only use is for extra flash storage cards. I like that the main compartment has an elastic divider pocket inside towards the front. i just wished it was a divider that was attached left to right side walls to make it bigger and not just a pocket sewed on to the front inside wall.overall i was able to fit my micro4/3 camera with 9mm lens attached, 1- 42mm lens w/ 37mm filter threads, 1 - 3.3 in lengthwise tele lens w/ 58mm threads, and battery charger + cord. Its a tight fit and a little bit of a game of tetris, but it works for me since its compact. In real life situations my camera would be out ready for use while this holds my two lenses ready to interchange.I give it 3-3.5 stars because it works for my camera but it was probably not designed to be used for mirrors-less cameras. But it does work for a minimalist, so i would say it fits under it's name as a compact/hybrid case. maybe just a few mm bigger and some design improvements it would be a 4-5 star case. But for the price you can't beat this cases value
2.0 out of 5 stars;NOT A FAST CHARGER;It says fast charger in the description. But it is still the older version. Charges slowly. Inaccurate website description. Series 7+ models can charge 80%  in 45 mins, which this cable definitely isnt capable of
4.0 out of 5 stars;Does Most of the job. Makes a good travel kit.;"I bought this for my Lumix FZ60k and it works well together with it. The side pouch for the charger. The inner divider to keep the lens cloth, and user manual for reference, at least until I remember everything in it. The camera fits sideways pointing to the right with the right side grip pointing up, making it easy to grab and push back in. In the top cover pocket I put a polarized filter just in case and the other pocket to put a spare battery. It all fits nice and snug and is looking pretty good as a travel accessory.But, ... it doesn't hold everything. For instance I would be a little hard pressed to get a tulip hood squeezed in, and not at all able to put a lens extender or a wide angle lens or close up lenses in with it. All of which I have and will have to pack in other bags if I take them. Even the Lens Pen (brush and lens solution cleaner) has no easy fit. But without film to carry, other than a spare memory chip, it really doesn't lack much for general needs. And I have a sealed box to hold other essentials at home, and these I really don't need on a trip anyway.So as long as you don't have the expectation of holding all your camera gear in one bag, this looks like a solid choice. Not quite ""I love it"", but better than ""I like it"", so long as it's not supposed to hold everything you need for your camera."
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect fit for our Nikon P510;We purchased this camera case for our Nikon P510 Camera. This case fits the bill perfectly.The main compartment is nice and soft with a flap that can stretch to fit some smaller sized point and shoot cameras to give you a good fit no matter what size camera you have. The main pocket has about a quarter inch of padding to protect the camera from any moderate bumps. It is secured closed with a zipper that runs around top-back edge of the case.The case also has zipper pockets on each side that work perfectly for storing the USB cable and charger for the camera so we can take everything with us all in one package. The side pockets do not have any padding to them so make sure you dont store anything fragile in the side pockets. Inside the main pocket flap there is also a small pocket secured closed with velcro that is nice for storing extra memory cards.For portability, there is a soft grip handle on the top as well as the adjustable shoulder strap. On the back of the case there is also a belt loop however I think this case is a bit too bulky to wear on your belt. I'm over 6' tall and when I set the shoulder strap at its longest length, it is the perfect length to put over my shoulder across my chest.We have been using this case fairly regularly for over a year and it seems to be wearing well. The zippers still work great and the fabric doesn't have any signs of wear or separation.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Simple, very compact, but very portable;"This product is very satisfactory at first impression. I have a Canon Powershot SX530 HS, a digital point-and- shoot in a DSLR-like body and it fits just fine albeit very snugly. In the main compartment where the camera sits, there probably isn't much room left after the camera goes in. you might be able to fit in a cord or two. The two side pockets make room for my battery charger and likely could find a handful of batteries and/or SD cards! There is also a mini pocket that resides in the main compartment that is part of the superior located ""tongue zipper flap"" of this main compartment. I was able to stow a SD card with its case in there. If compact is what you are looking for, this is most definitely compact and very functional for traveling and increased portability. If you're looking for complete protection, I'd look into hard cases as this will only protect your camera from scratches and likely very minor falls. The material is just too thin and soft to be anything more than superificial protection. The quality of material appears to be excellent but I would expect that from a reputable brand like Case Logic. If there are any changes in regards to its durability, craftsmanship and functionality I will be sure to update this review!"
3.0 out of 5 stars;It is smaller than it appears in the photo;"This small of a case won't hold some of the more serious bridge cameras out there. So, in my opinion, this is not really a ""Hybrid Case"". It is a compact camera case that a few of the smaller hybrid cameras will fit into. And to me, it is a shame, and to  dishonest for these outfits not to show in their photographs,  in a real sense, something that shows what the actual size of these kinds things are.And yes, now I see the measurements described on their promotional page.But people don't always notice the difference between the fantasy these promo photos create, and the actual size of things. I even watched the video, and it looked larger there. But I guess they used a tiny bridge camera in the video. But it would be so easy for these outfits to show various models of these kinds of cases, next to several camera, models, and  also have a list of recommended cameras to go by.My son's camera just did fit, but there is certainly no extra room, nor any need for that divider in the main case compartment."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Tight fit, but a good case for my Canon SX50 HS;I read a whole bunch of reviews about this case before deciding to buy it, but I'm glad I did.  I needed a case for my Canon SX50 HS camera, something not too bulky but that would carry the camera, charger and a couple of spare batteries.  This bag does the trick!  The SX50 fits in a little tight, but I rather like that since I wouldn't want it jiggling around in a bag.  I was able to put the charger and two spare batteries in the side pockets without any problem, and threw a lens pen in the main compartment, in the area separated from the camera by the divider.  That's all I need to carry around.  Any additional cables (USB or HDMI) don't need to go everywhere I take the camera, although I could make them fit in there if needed.  And for $10, I really can't ask for much more!The only drawback I see with this bag is that it takes a couple of seconds to pull the camera out because of the tight fit.  That hasn't been a problem for me, but it may be for some people, so I'm taking one star because of that.  I any case, I definitely recommend this bag for the SX50 or any other similarly-sized superzoom camera. Be warned, this is a smallish bag, definitely not for larger superzooms or even for small DSLR cameras!!!!
4.0 out of 5 stars;El bolso es practico;No le di 5 estrellas porque cuando lo ví en fotos parecía más grande y cuando me llegó me desepcione pero está bien para una cámara pequeña.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Too small;Too small for Nikon D33
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good case;It's a little tight, and I'd like a little more room in the pockets for my battery charger, spare batteries and spare memory cards, but by being a little creative, I can get my Canon HS40 camera into it by putting it in sideways, I can get two spare batteries in the pocket on the top, a couple spare memory cards in their cases and the little pouch to hold the battery terminal protector in a pocket on one side, the charger in the side pocket on the other side and my microfiber lens cleaning cloth in it's cover and the USB cable to download my pics in a flap behind the camera. It's a snug fit, but it's well padded, compact, and does hold everything. It would be nice to have a little bigger pockets so I could eventually add additional filters for my lens, but it seems to be very well made and keeps my equipment from getting banged up by flopping around in it. I would definitely buy it again if I needed to, although if a similar case were to become available with an additional pocket or two, or slightly larger side pockets for a reasonably comparable price, I'd probably go for that instead. It would be great for the little square, flat cameras that don't look like the old 35mm film cameras.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great case for Canon SX30 IS;"I bought this case for my Canon SX30 IS on 06/12/12. It shipped on 06/13/12 and arrived on 06/15/12. Nice.Pros: The case is good looking, and very well built. Ths zippers are sturdy and smooth. It provides a secure storage area for the SX camera, as there is little-to-no room for wobble. In other words... it's a snug fit. There's storage for memory cards in the zippered pocket under the lid. There's storage for cables, extra batteries, or whatever in the zippered pockets (w/mesh dividers) on each side of the case.Cons: There is room in the ""main"" compartment for the camera only. Not an issue if you don't use add-on lenses. Wide-angle, fisheye, or telephoto lenses will have to be removed before the camera will fit into the bag. Not enough storage space for the extra lens(es). If you have extra lenses, you may want to consider a larger case such as the DCB-306. I suggest adding a little more padding to the bottom of the case. A little extra insurance in case you accidentally drop it on a hard surface.Summary: This is a great case if you are wanting to protect/carry your SX camera and a few accessories. Make sure you add another item to your order so you qualify for free shipping. I didn't, and the price practically doubled. My error..."
3.0 out of 5 stars;Did not work for my SX40HS;"I wanted to like this case. It is very well made and it just barely fits my Canon SX40HS. I think it does a good job protecting the camera. I guess I assumed that a really snug fit would be what I wanted in a case. For me the fit turned out to be a little too snug.I don't want to sound like Mr. Fussy here but I use a case to protect the camera when I am carrying it. And the only reason I carry my camera is to use it. When I am ready to use the camera I want to get it out of the case relatively quickly. When I am done, I want to put it away just as quickly. I did not really succeed at either. I tried positioning the camera in the case several different ways (can't imagine too many choices there). I had to wrestle the camera in and out of the case no matter how I did it. Twice, while attempting to put the camera away, I accidentally  turned the camera on in the case - the lens attempted to extend and made a horrible clicking sound because it was snug in the case. All I could think about was the dreaded Canon ""Lens Error"" that I have already experienced with several of my beloved Canon point and shoots. Luckily, that did not seem to be enough to cause death by ""Lens Error"". On several occasions I removed the camera from the case only to have the lens cap pop off. One time I went to remove the lens cap only to put my thumb squarely on the lens.The case became enough of a hassle that I started looking for excuses not to carry the camera. That is just plain nuts so I am going to get a larger case.Now my experience may speak more to my clumsiness and ineptitude than anything else but if any of this resonates with you I would strongly suggest getting a bigger case."
5.0 out of 5 stars;A versatile bag for my Sony Mirrorless camera.;"I use this for my Sony a6300 mirrorless camera with the 16-50 mm kit lens.  It fits into this bag with room to spare.  There is an internal pocket where you could store flat items, such as a multi SD card case, for example.  There is also a zippered pocket on the inside of the bag's lid which I use to store a spare SD card, although there is room for three or four more, I'm sure.  I store a spare battery in one of the two zippered exterior side pockets, although I will fit two in that one pocket when I travel.  I don't even use the second pocket, although I might find something to store there on my next trip.  In addition to the shoulder strap, there is a sturdy belt loop built into this bag.  I haven't tried this feature out yet, but I might use it when I hike or bike!  In summary, I really like this tiny ""big"" bag!  It's roomy for its size."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Well constructed case, although a bit snug.;With some close examination of this case, I can say it appears to be very well made.  Stitching in on point, panels are all aligned, material seems quality, and zipper pulls have the nice added feature of being rubberized.  For all intents and purposes, it seems like a top notch camera for vacation and casual use.That being said, I came across this case when I was searching for a case for my Canon SX10.  This was the top pick that was returned via my search.  However, it seems a little too snug and doesn't allow for a lot of accessories despite the external pockets.  If given a chance, I would have selected a 'slightly' larger bag to accomodate a lens hood, or a few extras.  For once you have the camera in the bad, and store an extra set of batteries and memory card...there's isn't much room for anything else.I would recommend a larger back if you have a lens hood, an extra lens, or an avid photographer who accesses his/her supplies regularly.  While this may be a well constructed and durable case, it really isn't practical for the every day photographer.
4.0 out of 5 stars;The angle of the photo may fool you.;Please note the photo does looks different than the actual bag, especially at the bottom, in the picture it looks as if the bottom is as long as the top.  Not so, look at the model 306 and you will see the bottom is tapered nose like.  The bag is well constructed and a good deal for the price. I have a sony dsc x400V, it fits in tight, using up the extra space designed for small accessories on the inside.  It will fit lens down, but it is tight and I am concerned about scratching the screen with the neck strap.  However it fits well in side ways.  The outer side pockets, are wider at the bottom but I lost space because my camera is a bit bulky.  However despite what I have written it does the job.  I am purchasing a small filter case with a hook to attach to the D ring on the outside of the case.  So, despite my remarks I am not complaining, as it still works for me.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Sturdy but small!!;I knew prior to purchasing, by reading the reviews, that this bag was small. I have the smallest Canon DSLR (SL1) on the market so I thought that it'd fit with a little room to spare, but yikes!!! I have in the bag my camera body with a 50mm lens attached and it's an extremely tight fit. If my lens wasnt attached, i dont think it would fit in the bag with the body. There are 2 small  external zippered compartments on either side of the bag, and I can't even fit my battery charger in just one of them...they will have to stay empty in order to not put even more pressure on my camera inside the bag. I'm not sure how anyone with a DSLR bigger than mine or a larger lens would make this work at all.Anyway, with all that being said, the bag seems to be well made, well padded, and Case Logic is a good brand with pretty consistent quality at an affordable price.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Well-made case - but limited due to small size;The case itself is well-built, typical of Case Logic cases. It's a basic case - one fixed divider inside (no velcro adjustment) nor webbing to secure contents. For what it is, it seems a decent case for the price.The challenge is that it's a very small bag. It is a very tight fit to be able to get the Panasonic FZ200, plus charger, plus some filters to all fit (other comparable sized super-zoom bridge cameras will likely have similar issues). The internal compartment separator becomes useless as the camera compresses against it, and the side pockets are too small to hold the charger, so the only place to store the charger is in the bottom under the camera, but then there's no padding between it and the camera. If you have filters, depending upon the size of your filter case you should be able to fit up to two in each side pocket, or use them for lens cloths, memory cards, etc. There is also a thin picket in the cover of the main compartment, although I haven't used that pocket.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Like this so much I bought a second one.;Purchase this same case eight years and it served me well.  I screwed up last weekend left it on a boulder in the Sierras and drove off.The multiple pockets, padding, zipper compartments, netting work for my needs with the main compartment is perfect for the SLR Nikon.I am sure this one will be a durable as the eight old case that has been around the world.
4.0 out of 5 stars;"""Just"" fits my Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ200 (if you want more room get the High Sierra Diplomat Lumbar pack)";This is a nice bag but it is a small bag. My Lumix camera fits in the bag with the lens hood facing backwards. There is just enough room for a few batteries, extra memory cards and maybe some filters. This bag is meant for whatever you are going to need for the day and is not going to fit all your camera accessories, so buyer beware. If you want a camera bag that fits everything you might want to go for more of a backpack bag. Also getting the camera in and out of this bag is hard as it is a tight fit so I find myself not replacing the camera in the bag when I'm touring.Edit: I recently purchased a High Sierra Diplomat Lumbar pack, which is a hiking pack, but it can also double as a travel bag. After consideration, I highly recommend getting Diplomat bag over this bag if you want more room. The diplomat bag is bigger, but as travel bag you are going to have more than just a camera to carry around and the Case Logic bag doesn't fit that bill.
3.0 out of 5 stars;"I ""works"" but...";"I have a Canon Rebel T3 with the standard lens. The camera and lens fit pretty snuggly into the bag, almost to the point of not fitting. But it works, kind of, and looks nice.I have two problems, though, which have brought me to buy another bag.#1 - The bag is small, like I said. The problem? The way the camera fits best is with the lens down (because the attached strap won't really fit and the back is wider than the front). Not a big deal if you lay it on it's side or something but if you stand it up like it's supposed to be, the lens gets the brunt of you setting it down. I didn't think much of this, thinking the case was protecting it, but the other day my camera would not take any pictures when on Auto Focus. I could shoot using manual focus, or use the video mode, but the auto focus is really the only reason the camera is so easy to use. Turns out my lens ring was jammed and I had to pull it out a little forcefully to get it to ""pop"" out. This may be baseless, but I blame the way the camera sits in this case for the problem since it jams the lens into the camera a little when you set it down.#2 - The bag is small :) There's just no storage at all other than two small pockets on the outside. It won't even fit the battery charger. And if you had a bigger lens? Forget about it.So I gave it three stars because I can't prove the case is what caused my lens problem (though it makes complete sense) and also, the size is a preference thing. I would prefer to be able to store some of the accessories with my camera."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Smaller than I expected but a nice case;This case works fine for my camera but I was looking for more of a backpack with more storage room. I love that this case has a few little places to put small items but there isn't room for much. It did have more room than the case that came with my Canon camera. While it isn't exactly what I was looking for, the price was reasonable and it will work to protect my camera. If I was traveling or going on a road trip, I would put this case into a backpack with my other essentials so I don't have to carry things separately.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Looks great...;...and it fits my Sony Nex-F3 camera with the 18:55 lens beautifully.  I don't feel there is enough protection (padding) on the inside to protect the camera if I happen to drop this bag though.  I have a Case Logic camcorder bag and that thing is padded very nicely (for my Sony HDR-SR1).  The wife and I have come up with a simple solution for this bag as there is a little room to spare on the inside.  We're going to the craft store and picking up some foam, cutting it to size, covering it with some nice thick cotton material, and lining the inside.  For the price of the case I am very happy with it.  Modifying it to make it suit my desire to better protect the camera doesn't bother me.  I almost forgot, this bag has pockets galore.  Although I gave it 4 stars, I would definitely recommend it.  If it had just a little more padding it would be 5 stars all the way.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Fits like a glove for SX40 HS;I have received the package today.Regarding the amazon order process : As usual amazon ordering process is fantastic and the prices are the best on the internet. I had the prime shipping, so got the product in 2 days.Regarding the product: I have a canon SX40 HS. I wanted a case which is just big enough to fit my camera. Based on the earlier reviews, I went for this case and never going to regret that decision. It just fit like a glove! I can keep the camera, battery charger, cables in the inside pocket and there are 2 external pockets to keep memory card etc.The good : It is compact and will fit the  super zoom cameras well.The construction of the case is pretty good as in the case of many case logic products. Its priced right.The bad : If you are planning to carry some extra accessories(like small tripods etc. ), this bag is not for you. It would be hard(impossible?) to keep any accessories other than the basic stuff.All in all i am very happy with the product and will recommend to people who are looking for compact case for their super zooms.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Well-made case, attractive and great price!;I ordered this for my Canon PowerShot SX410IS and am so pleasantly surprised, this is a well-made, attractive case..  Initially I looked at the Canon cases which cost more money and then decided, based on the reviews, to order this one.  I am so glad I chose this! There's plenty of room for the camera, plus there are zippered pockets galore, three to be exact. There is one zippered storage pocket on each side of the outside and one in the interior flap.  There is also a pocket in the inside for storage in front of the area you'd place the camera.  So there's plenty of room for extra batteries, SD cards or even a personal item or two.  It comes with an adjustable strap and there's also a loop on it if you'd prefer to wear it on your belt.  Overall very pleased with this purchase and I'd highly recommend it.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Ok basic bag.;This bag will meet basic needs. Much lower price than many bags.  I am using the bag to store a Canon SX40.  Tighter fit than I expected, but the camera fits and it protects the camera.  Padding could be a little thicker on the bottom.  I was a little concerned about storing the camera lens down, so I store the camera on it's side in the bag.  Two side pockets on the outside of the bag and a small zipper inside on the top of the bag can store an extra batteries, or SD cards, or other small items.  The Canon battery charger fits in one of the outside pockets, but it is a tight fit.  There is a loop on the back of the bag so you can attach it to your belt and wear it like a fanny pack.  If you need a simple storage bag to protect your fixed zoom camera this will work.  Good bag for the price.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Satisfecho, tamaño pequeño pero justo para una canon M50;Excelentes materiales y costuras fuertes, el tamaño me funciona para una canon M50, satisfecho con la marca case logic, muy duraderos sus productos
2.0 out of 5 stars;Too small;My Nikon Cool Pix 950 does not fit in this case. A video said that has a sling to secure your lens, but it doesn’t have that and there’s no way a super zoom can fit into this case.  I can Fit my Canon SX60 in it (barely) so it’s storage for a useless camera.  you have a larger bridge camera, look elsewhere because this ain’t it.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Bag was smaller than I expected, but sized perfectly for FZ-200;The photos make it look as if you would put a camera sideways in the bag, however that's not the case. You would put your (smaller) DSLR or super-zoom lens-down into the bag.For me that's fine. In fact I prefer that position myself. This bag fits my Panasonic FZ-200 with the hood on and just enough space for the strap if you have it attached. It's a close fit, but it's not too tight.Material is good quality, pocket space is just big enough to fit the battery charger on one side and a spare battery and cards on the other. Or you could leave the charger out and fit a couple filters or *maybe* a small flash.The neckstrap is thin and a bit short.Overall it's worth the money if you're looking for a decent case to protect your camera from average bumps, or to protect it in a bookbag/suitcase. If you've got more to carry, such as tele-extenders, flashes, etc. I'd look for something bigger.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Really convenient size for super zoom cameras;This bag is a really convenient size for super zoom cameras.  It's easy to slip the camera in with the grip up, so you just unzip the bag and reach in, grab the camera and pick it right up ready to snap a photo.  It does have ONE design flaw that Case Logic really should fix.  The angle of the shoulder strap tabs as they are attached to the bag.  They are attached square, which might be okay if the bag was carried straight off your shoulder. But if you are like most folks and will wear this across you body, it doesn't work so well.  It causes the D-rings to twist in the attachment tabs to the bag.  It bunches up the tab and puts more stress on the outside edge of the tab.  It could eventually break there. And if you are OCD like me, that ring twisted out of position just bugs me.
1.0 out of 5 stars;High temperature while charging plus others;Not recommended because some strange facts:._ Watch is overheated while charging._ strange sounds from watch or cable while charging._ extremely low charging rate.All the 3 topics above, does not happen when use original braided cable version that comes with the Apple Watch Ultra box.
3.0 out of 5 stars;SMALL bag;Its a nice little bag...but really didnt know how small until I recieved it.It is great if you are planing to just carry your camera in it. But I personally like to take as much as I can with...it would be nice to carry it all in one bad (camera items that is).Im using this with my new (man its nice to say that) FZ-40. I do a lot of travelling so I would like to be able to carry pretty much everything for the camera in one bad (keeps from misplacing things).The camera I bought has the normal items with it....Ill go step by step in how they fit.Camera...tight but fits pretty good. Not a lot of padding so I would be freaked out if I dropped it in the bag.Charger...seems to fit fine in the side pocket, kind fo tight.Cords...seem to fit fine also, on top of the camera...kind of tight but able to zip.Manuals and software...this is a problem. They have a little inside pocket for them but its REAL tight. Im certain if resting the wrong way. the CD's can easily be damaged.Overall I can get everything in it. ITs extremely tight. So I would have ti figure something else out for an additional battery, sd card (its so tight I wouldnt want to ruin one), I would eventually like to upgrade the lense with 2-3x wide angle and filters. There definately will not be space for that.....nice little bag to take out ofr an afternoon. I wouldnt suggest travelling with it though.
5.0 out of 5 stars;good camera bag;Bought this for my grand daughters camera we got her for Christmas. Its nice, has several pockets for memory cards and other stuff. Seems to be sturdy, and fits her camera nicely. She's loving photography, so this was a great purchase to help keep her things together.
4.0 out of 5 stars;MISSLEADING ADVERTISING;"The Tiffen 58 mm Circular Polarized Filter was offered as part of the Nikon Coolpix B700 camera that I bought.  The problem is that this filter does not fit the camera, so it is useless to me.A similar situation occured a few months ago when I bought a Nikon D550 camera and I was offered a Wasabi Power Battery (2-Pack) and Charger as a ""frecuently bought together"" item.  In this case, the batteries were for Canon cameras, not Nikon, and they don't fit.In both cases, the ""frecuently bought together"" was missleading because if it was offered as part of the items purchased, one thought they were approiate for those items. This was not the case."
3.0 out of 5 stars;Was too small for Kodack pixro az901;It was too small
4.0 out of 5 stars;My Mistake;"I ordered this on accident as I meant to get a DCB-306.  It was too small to comfortably fit my Fujifilm Finepix HS35EXR but that's my fault.  I was able to get the camera into the bag but to say it was a snug fit would be an understatement. That camera, even though it's not a SLR, requires a larger bag.The bag itself is made well and seems like it would be comfortable carrying around.  The side pockets are a bit tight for carrying things like extra batteries, cables, etc but again, this may just be my experience with it.Basically pay close attention to the dimensions of the camera and the section ""Fits Devices - 5.8"" (l) x 3"" (w) x 4.6"" (h)"".  I didn't and now my niece is going to get this one as a belated Christmas present."
5.0 out of 5 stars;for what i needed it works;so far this is holding up really well. i have had for a couple weeks. i purchased for my canon t5i with the standard lens for travel. i also wanted a more purse like bag to carry around. i can put my i.d. and a little bit of cash in the inner pocket. for walking around and taking photos i can leave the camera in the bag lens down, screen up and it sits real snug. i push the strap all the way to one side and then leave it hanging out sometimes after i zip it. no room for any bigger lens then the 18-55. maybe a smaller lens would work-- but, forget about having a zoom lens and using this size bag. for what i wanted it works. and, the extra pockets are great.
4.0 out of 5 stars;For my Lumix FZ200 bridge.;It is a well made, stylish case that fits my camera nice and snug with a little room to spare. There is not a lot of extra room, but you can fit your charger, a battery and a couple of lens filters in the side zipper pouches just fine. I don't think there would be enough room for a flash. For some reason, to me, the case is smaller than it appears in the photo. It is kind of an optical illusion, but it is a nice tight, small, padded case that does the trick for me. It has a belt loop also which can be really handy for hiking situations. I have already accidentally dropped my camera in this bag. I am pleased to report there was no damage whatsoever.Its a great value. I would buy it again for sure.
5.0 out of 5 stars;GREAT…It REALLY holds A LOT !;"2 Pack Battery And Charger Kit For Canon PowerShot SX280 HS, SX510 HS, SX520 HS, SX170 IS, S120, SX600 HS, SX700 HS, SX610 HS, SX710 HS, SX530 HS, SX540 HS, D30 Digital Camera (Replaces NB-6L Battery)

Canon PowerShot SX160 Digital Camera Case Point & Shoot Digital Camera Case, Black / Grey - Replacement

Case Logic DCB-302 Compact Camera Case (Anthracite)
Just what I needed. This bag holds ALL of the above:  2 cameras:  Cannon SX160 and 610 WITH above cases (in main compartment), 2 Lithium batteries (one in case, one in divided main compartment), charger (in side pocket) 4 AA batteries (in one side pocket), cleaning cloth (inside zippered top) …WOW ! You won't be disappointed.  Mentioned the cases I used because I could just hear people saying, ""What cases did she use?"" to fit into this case."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice Case for Long Zoom Camera;"I bought a new Nikon P520 Camera and have been searching for a case for over 6 months.  Nikon had one on their site but it kept saying it was not ""Available"" for purchase yet so I have been waiting.  This case was so inexpensive that I thought I would go ahead and try it.  It is a REALLY GOOD case for a long zoom camera!  I have only one complaint...... I like to carry my camera's ""Quick Start Guide"" and battery charger with me and there is not room in this case once you get the camera in.  The camera fits really well and the case holds extra batteries and memory cards.  It's also easy to take in and out of the case.  I would recommend it..........."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Interesting;Has enough space but man the material makes my skin crawl. That's probably just a me thing though so I recommend it.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Fits Panasonic FZ80 just fine...;As always, Amazon gives you a huge variety of choices for camera bags.  This one works best for me because I wanted a small compact size bag that would fit just my camera giving if a layer of protection.  My FZ80 fits snugly without a lot of bounce around movement, but removes quickly. Two outside side compartments hold small items.  Good strap for shoulder, top strap handle, and the ability to attach to belt make for comfortable carry.  Opening and closing are easy to grab because zipper handles are rubber coated and also protect camera from being scratched.  Very inexpensive for quality and features.  Attractive as bags go.
4.0 out of 5 stars;good and satisfied.;handy and its fit on my camera.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice little case.;So I needed a case to fit my new Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ70 .  I read a few reviews here, and saw many posters say this case fits it.  I can indeed also confirm that it fits.  It's a bit snug, but I kinda like that.  It does have enough pockets and room to take a few accessories with you.  Though if you are packing too much, it might be a tight fit.Still for it's price it's a nice little case.  I haven't gotten to use it much  yet, but it does seem like it will hold up for good normal use.  Over all I would give it 4 out of 5 stars.  Great price, seems well made for the price, overall a nice little budget case.
4.0 out of 5 stars;A Good Fit;I gave this camera case 4 stars because the top zipper doesn't travel smoothly 3/4 of the way open. it likes to stick at that point. Other than that I have no complaints. My Canon PowerShot SX50 HS camera fits inside perfectly and there are plenty of smaller pockets for accessories. I was contemplating the introduction of some Vaseline to the top zipper but I have no idea if doing that will cause deterioration to the case's material. I would recommend this Case Logic DCB-304 to anyone in need of a compact hybrid camera case that is very affordable. I have seen similar camera cases in the brick and mortar stores with a substantially higher price. Thank you Amazon, for letting me state my opinion and rate this product.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not Very Water Reaistant, But packs a Nikon 1 Perfectly.;I purchased this to hold a Nikon 1 camera with a 10-100 lens attached to it, plus a 10 mm 2.8, and some batteries and memory cards. Everything fits in it and the case is very light weight. It has a very small form factor so it will be nice to vary around Tokyo on my upcoming trip to Japan.It’s the perfect size and design for the Nikon 1.My only complaint is that it is not very water resistant. I had it in my backpack, and a bladder leaked in the backpack. There was only about a cup of water leaked, but the case drew very damp and was stacked all the way through. Fortunately my new camera was not damaged.This product’s design would be perfect if the fabric was more water repellant. But since the camera is not fully protected from the  elements I can only give it 3 stars.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Had to Return;This is a nice enough bag, but was too snug for my Panasonic Lumix FZ300. I needed a bag that fits my camera with a lens hood, strap, and a charger with extra battery. This one, you can fit the camera and extra battery, but that is about all. Also, my preference for a camera bag is to have two zippers on top, and this one only has one. I returned the bag.

4.0 out of 5 stars;Good case for Sony a6000 if you have more than just the kit lens;I was looking for the smallest possible case for my new Sony a6000 camera. I bought 2 cases: this one and the DCB-303 also by Case Logic. My goal was to find a case that fit the a6000 with just the kit lens attached and had room for a few spare batteries and SD cards. This case was just a bit too big with nothing besides the kit lens attached to the camera. I don't have any other lenses yet, but when I do I couldn't even be sure the 304 would fit them. The 303 fit it like a glove.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Own a camera? Must buy one!;Case Logic is quite possibly your best bet for carrying any sort of camera around. The cases are extremely well made, and with great material. The case is really sturdy so it protects all your cameras and accessories. Just be sure to find the right size for your camera style and I can't find any reason to give less than 5 stars. I have had a case now for a few years, with a lot of use out of it. My case is still in tact and no damage at all, not even fraying. The multiple zippers on it allow you to store batteries and cables.I bought mine for my NIKON L820 and it fits like a charm, heck I even keep my older compact digital camera in it as well because there is a nifty side pocket in the main storage. Amazing case and very very great price!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great for GoPro and some accessories;"I like to pack light when traveling and was looking for a ""right sized""  camera bag for my Go Pro Hero 2 and my most used accessories and this one is as perfect as I can imagine.A list of items that easily fit together in the bag.1- GoPro Hero 2 with new Hero 3 dive type lens and LCD backpack attached in waterproof housing with tripod mount attached.1- small ""Ultra pod"" tripod.1- 3'ft. usb cable for charging/uploading/viewing.1- extra backdoor for housing2- instruction manuals, 1 for GoPro and 1 for LCD backpack.1- Wasabi wall charger and 2 extra batteries.1- car cigarette lighter charger3- video cards in casesThere is still room enough for a couple more batteries, cards, small mounts, etc. and everything is very well padded yet easy to get to.  I am very pleased especially for the price."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great case but a little bit too small;"I bought this bag to use with a Pentax K-50 DSLR. The camera fits in it with no room to spare. I have a USB cable in one of the side pockets and my lens caps in the other. I don't think I could fit anything else in this case. It's a little bit smaller than I was hoping for but I suppose it is labeled as a ""compact"" case. I wish there was a size between this one and the next size up because that would be perfect. Still, the size aside, it's a great case and I really like it."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good for really small cameras.;It's nice, but too small for a camera with a lense. I think it is only good for a small cameras without additional lense. My Camara barely fits in.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good camera case, but a bit small for larger camera.;I would rather rate this a 3.5 but was unable to. It is a nice camera bag, but although it is titled for a high/fixed zoom camera, it really isn't large enough to easily accommodate a zoom lense camera and I'm not talking DSLR with detached lenses and things, we have a high zoom Sony camera. It took me a few tries to find a way to put the camera in the bag so I could get it out easily, and in doing so am unable to put something in one of the side pockets. My husband became very irritated with it because of the difficulty in taking the camera in and out.If the center opening were just a little larger it could accommodate everything with ease. But all in all it is very nice, could just be a bit larger.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Recommend - kept my camera safe from bumps and dry;I use this for travel. It keeps my camera safe, guarded against humidity, I also slightly soaked under a waterfall and my camera was fine. The strap came in handy as I wore it cross-body while I walked around.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Happy;This is compact and cute. It makes carrying my Sony ZV1 easy and it's spacious enough. I' happy with the purchase.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good Quality. Small/Compact. Ideal For Family Gatherings.;"We purchased the ""Case Logic DCB-304 Compact System/Hybrid Camera Case (Black)"" mostly for short travels/storage. And it suffices for that purpose. We also purchased the Canon EG100 and that camera bag far exceeds the Case Logic Camera Case. The exterior of this case is water repellent. Basically, it has a single compartment inside with a small slot for documents. If you would like to fit more things in there, you will find it awfully inconvenient when trying to take the camera out. Do not expect to be able to fit larger cameras, additional lenses, spare battery packs, etc.It does have a small zippered pocket on the inside of the flap and on each side but not liking them too much. There is barely enough room to fit your charger, USB cable and SD cards alone. Tight fit.Cushioning is very thin. Quite small. However, it's great for carrying your camera and some gear to family gatherings."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Well made case, just not perfect for the Canon SX50 HS;Case is typical of this company. Well made and padded. However the Canon I have only fits in one way lense first and I don't think the case is padded sufficiently enough that if it were dropped straight down it would protect the lense?? Side pockets are easily accessible, however with the Canon in the case, you can't fit much in them due to tightness of the case. I keep a battery in one side and the charging unit in the other and thats pretty much all you can fit. The next size bigger would probably be a better choice for this camera.For the price, quality and construction, this is a good, not best case for the Canon SX50 HS
4.0 out of 5 stars;Case is too small for camera;This case was featured on the Amazon site for the Fujifilm HS30EXR camera, so I bought it when I bought the camera.However, this case is TOO SMALL for this camera.  The camera BARELY fits and is difficult to put in and take out.It is a nice case, but I would not recommend it for the the HS30EXR camera.I am very disappointed that Amazon would pair this camera and this case.My fault for not comparing the interior dimensions with the dimensions of the camera...but I went with the case featured on the Amazon site for the camera.My old Lowepro TLZ Mini is a better fit.Buyer beware.4 star rating is for the case...not the size vs camera issue.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Snug for SX40;I recently acquired a Canon SX40 and needed a new bag. Based on the reviews, it sounded like this bag would be a good fit. While the camera does fit, it is extremely snug. Once the camera is inside and strap folded up, there really isn't any room for anything else. The pocket on the lid is big enough to hold a spare battery and an extra memory card. The two side pockets are also large enough hold a battery, memory cards, or possibly a filter or two (I do not yet own any filters so I can't confirm). I think this bag will work for times when I want to transport the camera in a compact bag, but I will be seeking a larger bag as I purchase accessories.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Panasonic Lumix FZ70;This was a suggested purchase to go with my Panasonic Lumix FZ70 camera.  The bag is large enough to hold the camera, but not much else.  In the main compartment with the camera, I was able to include the battery charger or a lens hood, but not both.  The two side pockets can hold an extra memory chip and an extra battery, but that's it.  The bag is OK if all you intend to carry is the camera and the bare essentials, but you might want to consider something a little larger if you plan to use a lens hood or filters.

4.0 out of 5 stars;Fits my Panasonic Lumix FZ70;After reading the reviews and seeing as it was a recommendation based upon the camera I now have, I finally went ahead and purchased this case. Today, I received the case in the mail and when I went to place my Panasonic Lumix FZ70 in it, I had to actually lay it face down inside the case in order for it to fit. There isn't much room elsewhere to really put my accessories. Even the side zipper pockets are a little small for what I want to put in there. Aside from that, I am happy with purchase.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice quality- has belt loop;It was not clear if there is a belt loop with this. The back has a nice one. As far as fit, the inside is a little larger than expected. A mirror less camera with a 14-42 pancake lens swims in this case. It will be okay with a larger zoom lens. The front inside side has a stretchable section that if used will take up a large portion of the interior and a camera would then not fit. The best Use for this stretchable area may be for something very flat, like a manual. There's nothing holding the camera tightly within the space. A good buy for $10, but not a home run.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Decent quality, but a little small;I purchased this to use while traveling with a DSLR. We got the bag in the mail the day before we were leaving - and I was disappointed to find that it was not as large as I was expecting. Based on the product videos and images, I thought that this was sized for a DSLR. Maybe I missed something, but at first try I couldn't even get the bag to zip up around my Nikon D5000! It took a little finagling with the strap placement (and making sure the 18-55 zoom lens was at the smallest possible size), but we did eventually get it to zip. It ultimately worked fine for our trip, but if we had had more time before we were leaving, I probably would've tried to get a different bag.The quality of the case is fine, and the small pocket on the side is nice for an extra memory card or spare battery. But beware if you are planning to use this for a DSLR with a big lens! This is probably a better case for someone looking to store a camera with a shorter lens like a prime.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good protection, nice pockets!;I have a Panasonic Lumix DMC FZ150 and it fits perfectly inside this compact case. The case has some nice interior pockets where you can fit SD cards, batteries, and short cables. On the side pockets I can fit my camera charger and a mini tripod. Anything more than that is pushing it. For my needs, I should have purchased something a bit larger to carry around a microphone or two for video recording, but if you are just planning on transporting your bridge camera and a few little extras then this is worth the money. Not for the DSLR user or point and shoot people, but great if you just want to carry one thing that will protect your camera.
4.0 out of 5 stars;It's good, but a little tight.;I use it with a fujifilm X100F that has the larger lens attached and it's a tight fit.  I am sure it would be better if I removed the larger lens.  As far as quality and workmanship, I can say it is top notch.
4.0 out of 5 stars;pleased with this camera case.;It is exactly what it purports to be, a compact carrying case for my camera.  I later replaced it with a larger one when I got some accessories which were too bulky to fit, but it protects my camera very well, is well made (not flimsy in any way) and does the job well for compact cameras without a lot of accessories.  It does have enough room for a small number of spare batteries, SDcards, lens caps, etc. Does require a small camera, for example, a Sony Alpha will not fit, but the smaller Sony cameras do (such as the HX300, etc.)
3.0 out of 5 stars;Size compared to camera;"Amazon site ""suggested"" this particular case for the camera bought from them. It was such a tight fit, that I was afraid that I would break the camera trying to get it in. And go ahead and try to pull the camera out. It was not easy! So it felt like I was CRAMMING it into the case, then RIPPING it out.A friend suggested to me, instead of sending it back and getting a bigger one, to give it some time to ""stretch"" it out some.So now I've been using it for a couple of weeks now, and by golly, it is stretching out. I can almost completely place the camera(FijiFinPixHS30EXR) without cramming it in there. Or tearing at it to get it out!You cannot keep the ""Hood"" on the lens and place it in case.I think the pockets are way too small, shallow. The top zipper has only slipped once at a corner, and fixed itself going over a couple of times.I gave it a 3 star cause I do love the padding. It feels like good protective padding, and the fabric is ""tuff""."
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great buy for my granddaughter!;She is enjoying using her first camera!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Super Quick delivery;I just ordered this on Friday and had it sitting on my front door step Saturday night. Luckily i got him when i did as the box had about an inch of snow on top of it. The case itself looks durable with a couple of side pockets. Our new camera fits inside comfortably. It will be comfortable to wear the shoulder strap, it wont be a big bulky in the way case. It's just the right size!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Small, but good!;I have a big camera, Nikon DX something something something. This fits my camera and the car charger safely. And there is room for the strap and a little of wiggle room. It fits all I need, but if you want something to carry your camera with room to spare, this isn't it.That being said, I had it with me riding horses and around cattle, with my camera and phone in the main pocket (separated by the divider). I have an iPhone 5 and no case, and my camera and phone both made it through the whole 3+ ride safe and sound!
4.0 out of 5 stars;I am very happy with the camera;I am very happy with the camera.  it is the easiest to use one i have ever had.  the zoom is great for sporting events that i mostly use a camera for.  the memory card holds so many pictures, i never have to worry about running out of room.  the case wasn't made specifically for this brand of camera or model and it is a little harder to get things placed in it, but it works.  i bought the case as part of the recommended items to go with the camera.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice Compact bag for short trips only;This is a nice bag to take your camera on short trips when you don't need to carry many accessories.  It has side compartments that will hold small items and a small zipper compartment inside that you can fit an extra battery and a memory card in.  But that is all that will fit into this attractive compact bag.  It would actually be better suited for a smaller compact camera and not the Nikon 500 that they recommended it for.  I have a larger bag that I bought at a flea market that is a great size for my Nikon and all of it's accessories.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great quality, somewhat inefficient;Let me start off by saying that this is a fantastic quality product and definitely worth the price. It's very well made and, though this sounds weird, it feels good to use it.However, the pockets are poorly designed. For one thing, the main flap opens away from your body, which would be fine, but it's hard to unzip it when it's right next to you.The side pockets unzip on two of their four sides (really 1.5 of their 3.5 sides but who's counting). This makes it very difficult to access some areas of them.Even with these possibilities for improvement, it's still a wonderful case and I highly recommend it!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Very good but for smaller cameras;I bought this along with the Panasonic Lumic DMC-FZ70 camera as one of the recommended accessories. Although this a great little case, it wasn't really suited for this camera as it was really too small.  It could barely fit in the camera with no room for the charger and adapter cord.  Luckily I already had a small camera bag that is approximately 9w X 6d x 6h that works great for the camera with charger, adapter, lens hood and filters.  This would be a perfect case for a smaller point and shoot camera.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great case but can't fit much other than a camera;"This is a really great case for holding a super zoom camera. I use it to hold the 
Canon SX40 HS 12.1MP Digital Camera with 35x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-Inch Vari-Angle Wide LCD
. The camera fits snugly and safely, but there isn't much room for anything else in the main compartment other than the camera itself. A camera strap will not fit in there along with the camera. As for the side compartments, they are convenient for holding two, maybe three small accessories, such as spare batteries. Just note the limited space when considering this case, but if that's not a concern it's a very good choice."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice compact case for mirrorless cameras;Great little case, especially for the price.  I use it for my Sony NEX-6 with the 16-50mm kit lens attached, as well as the 55-210mm zoom lens on top of it - it fits both (snugly).  As the product description suggests, it's really made for mirrorless/CSC cameras, and not full SLRs, so keep that in mind.  So if you have a mirrorless/CSC, aren't carrying too many add-ons and you want a compact case, this will work well.  There are also a few side compartments for storing small items, like a memory card, or lens caps.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Just the right size;The Case Logic DCB-304 Camera Case is the exact right fit for a DSLR or SLR type camera. I have a Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX200V and it fits fine. The side and top pouches hold the camera charger and usb cables. It pretty much has just enough space to hold everything I need for the camera (no room for additional lenses, if you're into that sort of thing). I like that it is compact and easy to carry around. The shoulder strap could be a bit longer or thicker but that is me just nitpicking. This is the best sized case and has all of the features you will need to protect your camera and carry it around with you without having to dent your wallet.-Ken FlemmingAuthor, How to Get a Job in Video Games
3.0 out of 5 stars;Decent Bag but Beware Size!;Camera: Nikon D3100Lens: AF-S DX NIKKOR 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VRThis is a nice little bag but the size of the bag was unclear at the time of purchase. The best I can do for you is to let you know which camera I use this bag for and hope that you can compare yours to it. My camera will fit into the bag but only with the lens off of the camera.  There is exactly enough room for the camera body and lens to remain in the bag separately. There are two side compartments for things like SD cards and an extra battery. The charger will not fit in this bag. The compartments are pretty small though so you would probably fit 1 battery into 1 compartment. There is also a flat zippered compartment on the lid of the bag. All in all, there isn't much room camera accessories. The bag is of good quality though and would be decent for point and shoot cameras or a compact dslr.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Was not the size I needed, but a good bag.;The bag is actually a really good bag, but Amazon showed it as a bag that would work with the camera that we purchased, it was not large enough.  I had this bag with another camera and it is a good bag.  So the three stars are not against the bag, and the company was great about the return.  If you are getting the Nikon Coolpix P900, the camera will not fit into this bag.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Fits a normal sized camera body with smaller lens;I bought this to protect a Sony DSC H300, a SLR-esque point and shoot. It fit the camera, but nothing else. The side pockets are big enough for a cable or a few memory cards at best.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great case for my Panasonic Lumix FZ200;I didn't really want to buy a bulky case for my camera but needed something to protect it while hiking and traveling.  This does the trick. The camera fits snugly in the main compartment with room to slide in extra filters or other small thin items in front and side pockets which can be used for the same. .  The charger takes up most of one  side pocket but there is another pocket in the lid to put a chord, or an extra battery, or more filters. It really is versatile and the price was right.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Love my camera bag!;"I totally guessed on the size and its a perfect fit. I already have another case logic camera bag and know the quality, that is why I wanted another one. My only ""issue"" is that the zipper seems backwards to me!  I keep reaching for the right side of the camera bag top for the zipper and its on the left. Totally a personal preference thing!!!! I would totally buy another case logic bag due to the quality, durability and storage pockets on their products."
4.0 out of 5 stars;I like it, but a tad smaller for my FZ200 and its accessories;Delivery was quick, no issues with order. Excellent price. Bought it for my new Panasonic FZ200 camera. The bag is cute and I was able to fit everything I need inside and in the pockets (the camera, the charger, a small tripod, two spare batteries and spare flash cards). Nevertheless, it would have been nice if the bag was a bit bigger to not have to cram everything. That's why I am giving it 4 stars only. Thank you.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect solution!  Excellent value.;This bag is the perfect complement to my new Nikon B-500 camera.  Great fit, easy access, well thought out design.  Lots of small accessory storage (batteries, memory cards, etc.)  Attractive appearance.  You can pack your compact zoom camera for a hike, and have everything you might need.  Seems to be really well made, the zippers, stitching, straps are all of very good quality.I saw many other similar products, but I'm glad I ended up with this one.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Barely big enough;I bought the Fujifilm Finepix bridge camera.  It's smaller than a full-sized SLR camera, which would probably not fit in this bag.  It does have side storage pockets, but they're not deep enough to hold much.  I can fit an extra set of batteries in one pocket, and one of the cords in the other.  But there's not enough room for the AC adapter.  It's on the edge of being too small, but for now it's working.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 3 because it seems very well made, and has adequate padding to protect the camera.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Very nice bag for the money;My new camera fits inside perfectly and it has a handy strap and plenty of storage room inside. Great purchase!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Decent Case for Canon PowerShot SX20is;I wanted an inexpensive case for my Canon PowerShot SX20is.  Reviews didn't provide a whole lot of guidance as to what cases would/would not fit this camera, so I took a chance on this one.  I need to put the camera in vertically (would prefer horizontally, but it won't fit that way) which is not a problem, because it's adequately protected. There's a zippered pouch inside that can hold sd cards and another area that could accommodate lens tissue.  Two additional pouches on outside could hold extra batteries and ??All in all, a decent case at a decent price.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Really small;My fault for not paying attention to the dimensions. Camera with 250 or 300 max telephoto lens will not fit in this. My fixed lens Canon powershot and Kodak easyshare fit in here. Guys might like it since they don't carry purses, but for its capacity, it would just be an extra thing to lug around when I could stick those little cameras in my purse. For carrying around more equipment, you need a MUCH bigger bag, like something that would stow under the airline seat in front of you. Something about three times bigger than this cute little bag.
3.0 out of 5 stars;too big;the camera i bought this was the suggested bag but it was too big so i had to send it back. for the price it seemed like a good bag.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Is and does exactly what it says.  Well built and easy to use.;Exactly what I expected is exactly what I got.  Fits my camera perfectly with room for neck strap.  Side pocket and interior  protected space is more than handy.  .....  May want to buy another that is slightly larger for this and smaller camera, but I am good for now.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Case Logic Camera case;All,With my Sony DSC HX 200w I also ordered the recommended case.In all I'll recommend it to everybody who is ordering the same camera.Case Logic has made a very well engineered Camera Case. The main compartment is well protected but rugged enough to protect the camera and with the sipper on the top side it is well accessible when you carry it on your belt. 2 side pockets give enough space to take extra batteries or UV lenses and on the inside of the case there is a small pocket for extra memory cards.it's a bargen...
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice product for the price;Holds my large Cannon PowerShot SX50 HS camera.  Has pockets for extra filters and nice padding with a handle and shoulder strap.  I plan on taking it with me overseas soon.  Husband was surprised at the low price vs the quality.  I really like the little loops that make grabbing the zipper pulls so much easier.  I would recommend this to someone else and would consider buying another one for other cameras. There wasn't quite enough room to hold the filters in the pouch they came in.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Not a bad Case;I bought a Canon Powershot SX50 and purchased this Case to put that camera in. The Case is somewhat cramped but it does fit the camera snugly (is that a word?). The build quality seems very good on the case. I'm able to fit my camera, 3 batteries (including the included one) and some cables. I unfortunately cannot fit any chargers with this case since the case just isn't big enough. I probably would have gone with a bigger case if i had known the how snug it would fit the camera. However, overall this is a great built case.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice but not big enough;"This case was recommended when I bought my Canon SX50.  It is just too small if you want to carry your hood, and other accessories.  It is fine for a day trip where you do not need to carry the accessories and want a cushioned case to tote your camera.  I like the style - just wish the ""camera storage"" area were bigger to handle the camera with the uv lens so when you try to put the camera in or take it out you don't knock the lens/adapters off."
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect size to pack a moderate size electronic camera.;Perfect size to pack a moderate size electronic camera with extra battery, charger and manual. My camera is a Canon SX400 IS and a perfect fit for the case. I am will to bet the a Canon rebel would be a tight fit. The case would be too small if my camera had an extra accessory lens. The case has packed my camera on a fairly long vacation this past summer and protected the camera well during the joselling of luggage in and out of planes and cars. The case does the job it was designed for and the price is right.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great little protective camera case!;"While not the most aesthetically pleasing, this camera case does its job rather well. My 
Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ200 12.1 MP Digital Camera with CMOS Sensor and 24x Optical Zoom - Black
 fits perfectly inside, with extra room if I intend to carry anything else. It offers wonderful protection. I bought it specifically for traveling and haven't had any issues. It has withstood rain and snow, keeping my camera safe and dry within."
4.0 out of 5 stars;works very well;a little cramped, but expected that from compact size, everything must be folded and oriented exactly to fit into this case
4.0 out of 5 stars;Solid case. Excellent value.;Picked this case up for my Panasonic FZ-150 and the camera fit perfectly. Simple, efficient design leaves no wasted space. Each pocket or container on the case is easy to access and doesn't feel cheap or flimsy. Only thing holding this back from 5-stars is the shoulder strap. Its pretty much your standard nylon strap with no padding of any kind. Really a minor complaint since the case with camera is so small and light you really dont need a padded mesh strap, but it would be a nice extra touch for a great case like this.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works well and is easy to use;This case works really well. It has side pockets that I keep extra batteries in and plenty of room in the main compartment for the hdmi cable and my Nikon camera. It’s comfortable to hang on my neck as I hike and easy to unzip and remove my camera quickly.
4.0 out of 5 stars;They all fit inside and everything is together so I don't have to look to find anything for the camera and it's easy to take on;Bought so I could store and bring my Nikon 9700 and all accessories, I have 2 chargers, the one that came with the camera and just a battery charger I bought from Amazon, a hdmi cable, a usb cable, a memory card case, and a small case that fits the camera. They all fit inside and everything is together so I don't have to look to find anything for the camera and it's easy to take on a trip
4.0 out of 5 stars;Bargus;I purchased this case for my husband to carry both a small video camera and his digital during a trip to Europe.  It has 3small zippered pockets in it as well as a small open pocket inside.  It worked well for our purposes.  The only con was that it was smaller than we would have liked but we were aware of the size when we ordered it and would have returned it for a larger case if we had any additional camera accessories to carry, such lenses, cords, etc
3.0 out of 5 stars;Great case, bum zippers.;I like this case it is the perfect size for my LUMIX GX1 and peripherals.  And the price is great.  I usually like Case Logic bags, having had several.  But why three stars?  Because I have pulled those pretty little tags off the zippers twice now.  They don't break, they just come through the space in the slider.  It's not hard to put them back on, good as new, but nothing prevents them from coming off again.  I buy a camera case to be tough and reliable.  This one is disappointing.  Maybe I can fix it with CA glue? I'd rather have a case that doesn't need pampering.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Nice and basic case;Protects my canon camera well and has extra compartments
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good price and as always Case Logic makes solid bags;Good price and as always Case Logic makes solid bags.  I use this to carry an old film camera, the Canon AE-1.  it works.  However, I am pretty annoyed that the lid of the case opens outwards.  I didn't know how annoying it was until this case.  But it's a small nitpick.  Overall, it's a decent bag and it did what I wanted it to.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great product;Purchased this product for a Nikon COOLPIX L340 Camera. Camera fits snug and it has enough room for the manual in the side pocket opposite the camera. It also has 2 smaller end pockets. I put the PC cable in one and the other could hold extra AA batteries and has a small flex pocket which I use for memory cards.Excellent product for the money.
4.0 out of 5 stars;I like the case very much;I like the case very much. It's sturdy and the camera fits well and this is why it gets my four stars. However, mine came with a two-inch defect right on the front of it as if a thread had been pulled or the case had been slit. Everything seems to be holding together, though--so far. Hopefully it is just a cosmetic defect and threads don't start unraveling.This very obvious defect should have been acknowledged by the seller and the price reduced accordingly.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice camera case;"I do like this case.  My Nikon P510 fits in it perfectly.  However, there is not much room for things that I like to carry--like my battery charger.  There are a couple of little pockets for extra HCSD cards and an extra battery.  I have a larger case that holds every thing and also carries all of my ""purse"" things, too.  I use it when I travel.  This case is to keep my camera in at home.  I can grab it when I need my cameral!"
3.0 out of 5 stars;shoddy quality but it does what it's supposed to;The bag is what I ordered. it is not too big, but has enough space to fit some extra cords and batteries as well as my superzoom camera. The one issue is that there's a little plastic section partitioned off with elastic, so the camera can go on one side and cords can be stuffed in the other side. When I opened the bag to have a look, I tugged the elastic lightly and it immediately tore out of the case. Looks like there was a loose thread in there that just wasn't secured properly. Now I'll have to sew it, because Amazon doesn't offer an exchange and I don't want to pay shipping for the refund and buy a new one.All in all it's a pretty decent bag, I really like the construction and the neoprene zipper pull, just wanted to point out the construction quality might be a bit lacking.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good size for backpacking with a Sony a6000;I use this on hiking trips for my Sony a6000. It fits my camera with a Sony E 55-210mm lens, extra batteries, memory cards, and lens caps perfectly. It doesn't have room for much else with the longer lens, but it doesn't take up much room in my pack and does a good job of protecting my camera. I just keep any extra lenses I want to carry in my pack.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Does what it is supposed to;I got this for my daughters Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ70KA camera. Works great for what she needs. It has several pockets so she can carry her camera, strap, lens filters, cleaning cloth and a spare battery and charger with her easily. Offers mild protection if dropped. Camera fits tight (insert it lens down for best fit), but easy to get out.Overall happy with the purchase
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect for the Canon SX40;This bag is perfect for the canon sx40, my only beef is that it doesnt have a rear or from pouch, and the side ones are tiny, like chapstick would be too much for those, however it fell into a creek without my camera in it thank science, and the water just rolled off it, no wetness at all.  Now im not saying its water proof but it wasnt even damp.  So id trust this to protect my canon.  I put my canon in batteryleft hand)side first so the processor(right hand) side is pointed to the top so when i see something, I can unzip, grip it and fire off some shots before my subject is gone.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Not The Right Size For The Nikon P900;This case has been featured with the Coolpix P900. Don't get it for the P900 as it won't fit. However, for the price I didn't send it back because I was able to use it for my Lumix and the Lumix case worked fine for the P900. This case was inexpensive and made decently for the price. It just isn't the right size for the Nikon P900.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Make sure of camera size before you buy;This case was too small for the CoolpixP900. I read a review saying that it would fit and although it does fit, it is way too snug with hardly any room for the camera, let alone accessories. I do like the bag however and did not return it because it now holds accessories for my cameras. It is a small lightweight case and looks awesome.
4.0 out of 5 stars;To small for average camera & any supplies.;Great camera bag but way to small for my camera & little tiny side pocket don’t hold anything really.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Compact FTW!;Compact, compact, compact. I love this case for ease of use, especially when traveling. There are side pockets but honestly there isn't much room for much else after you camera goes in.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Attractive, is light and has convent compartments without being too bulky.;Just got it so haven't put it through the paces yet but so far it looks sturdy, but light, and much cheaper than a leather case. I opted not to get the leather case cause although they look great they can be impractical, not having room for storage. I bought a Leica V-Lux 4 same time, which fits comfortably in it. The extra pockets will come in handy for camera supplies. I am looking forward to using it. If I change my mind about it I'll post an update.
3.0 out of 5 stars;It’s too small;It’s good if you’re just thinking in have a normal or just one lens cam. If you want to buy more lenses this won’t work
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great Value;My camera and accessories fit perfectly.
3.0 out of 5 stars;This is really small!;Hopefully it fits Kodak astra zoom. Will find out later.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good quality but no harness;I have bought dozens of Case Logic cases and as always thus one is good quality. My only complaint with this case is I wish it had the camera harness/hammock that some of their bigger camera cases have. I use it for my Sony a6300 when I use the small lenses
5.0 out of 5 stars;Camera bag;Love the size the compartments  for battery and extra discs. Camera fits great.  Even have a place for the charger
4.0 out of 5 stars;This bag is really small. I bought without paying ...;This bag is really small.  I bought without paying much attention to the dimensions, LOL.  The quality of the bag is top notch.  I use it to carry Fuji-XT1 with prime lens.  XT1 with 18-135 lens barely fits.  You have to watch out the zipper.  Overall, I'd use it for carrying small SLR with prime lens for business or street shooting.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great padding!;Fits the Sony DSC-HX300/B 20 MP Digital Camera like a glove (not OJ's). First let me say this is a dern fine piece of kit! I come up with the means to acquire one of these here bag's, and it is slicker than cat dung on a hot tin roof let me tell ya. I use this as a game bag, and i can git about 25 snipe's (a full day huntin) in er. The extra paddin help's not to bruise all my vittles up before i get to the cabin. Couldnt recommend dis any more it's Tougher than a one-eard alley cat, and scarce as hen's teeth round there here part's.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Sturdy, practical, compact;This was my third purchase of this case.  All three still in service for my succession of Canon  PowerShot SX50, SX60, and now SX70 compact zoom cameras.  Camera fits snugly, spare batteries in the side pockets.  Used every day for years and showing no signs of wear.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nicely Made Bag;The bag is nicely made. The zipper's are of good quality and the padding seems to be sufficient. My zoom camera fits in easily without being too tight and there's enough room for a few small add-ons, like a extra memory card and battery. It's a good bag for a day of shooting at the beach, Disneyland or a family gathering. But I would recommend something a little bigger if you're going on vacation and need to take your battery charger and cables.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great fit for my Canon Powershot SX40 hs;"I was looking for a smaller camera bag to use for my Canon Powershot SX40 hs and this fit the bill. I have room for the camera, extra batteries, SD cards, and charger. I do wish it had an extra 1/2"" width in the main compartment because I have to place the camera in a certain way so that the lens cover doesn't pop off, but that's me just being picky! It's a great case for this model and the older/newer versions of this model."
5.0 out of 5 stars;Fits my Canon Powershot  SX530 camera;Has enough room for camera, 2 batteries & battery plug-in, with room to spare.  Just what I needed.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works but...;It's a well made camera case, I give that..But I went by the measurements and was still too small for my SLR camera.. It's just a tight fit. My camera fits but could use a size larger.Be careful when ordering as I thought I was doing. I paid close attention to measurements of my new camera and this bag but still too small in my opinion. But a very well made bag none the less..
4.0 out of 5 stars;EOS M Owners;Very good fit for EOS M with Pancake lens attached, but not perfect for those looking for a snug fit. It's snug enough so that the camera does not move around. There is enough room if you are using a larger lens. There is also enough room for the charger, cables, extra battery and cards. I am very happy with the fit, but if you are looking for a perfect minimalist fit, this is not it. Quality is also great.
3.0 out of 5 stars;For sony dsc-hx100v;Great camera Case for the price. Was reccomended for the newer class of super zoom cameras. Good case for the money with lots of compartments and pockets. Only negative is the Sony fits rather tightly and does not allow room to carry charging cables for camera. If you are looking for an all around camera case for super zoom cameras this is a good one as long as you don't mind not being able to carry your charger or cables with you. For the price and portability I am going to keep it but only for the times i just want to take the camera along... However i will end up buying something that will hold everything I need for trips and the convenience of keeping it all together. Would welcome anyone's comments on the best bag for the new Sony hx100v.
4.0 out of 5 stars;smaller than you think;nice case but a lot smaller than I thought it was, it will work though.
4.0 out of 5 stars;quality product, but...;I agree that case logic makes quality camera bags.  I have several already and so purchased this one without hesitation.  It is a high quality case at a good price.  However, my Nikon Coolpix P510 just barely fits in the case and there is not much room for the cables that came with the camera.  So, I would recommend case logic products but just make sure that if you have a bigger camera, you get a bigger case.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good for smaller cameras;I bought this case for a Panasonic Lumix FZ70 that I purchased at the same time, it does the job of holding the camera.  The fit is pretty tight, and there is not much room left for accessories like the charger, but the strap is plenty long enough, and if you are good at Tetris, you can make everything fit with that camera.  My only complaint is that sometimes when pulling the camera out, the lens cap will come off due to the tight fit in the center compartment.  The bag was really an afterthought though and I didn't really research before purchasing, I mostly bought it because it was on the frequently purchased with spotlight.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Decent bag for a kit lens and camera;Bought this bag for my Canon T2i and a tamron 18 - 270 lens but sadly my camera with the lens doesnt fit in this bag. This bag is great for a standard kit lens and camera. Snug and has lots of small pockets for wires/cards etc. The bag is great for the price but this is just not for zoom lenses. Go for it if you are looking for a cheap/durable bag for a camera with a kit lens.
4.0 out of 5 stars;More room needed for charger;The camera fits well into the case as well as the instruction booklet and the UBC cord. It's easy to handle.  However, the battery charger is too big to put in one of the side pockets when the camera is in the case.  So I decided to keep it in the box my camera was in.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice Case but Didn't Work for Me;It's a nice little case at a good price. I bought it for a Panasonic Lumix FZ2000 but the camera won't fit in the case with the lens hood on and I prefer to leave the hoods on my lenses. I ordered it at the same time as the camera, so wasn't sure about the dimensions, but it was recommended for a hybrid camera. I'm returning it and found a Lowepro Adventura 140 that will be a better fit.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Tough little reasonably price case;Tough, does the job for carrying my camera as I hike.  Its size makes it great for outdoors camera folks, also results in not having room for a lot of accessories but just a great buy for the price.  I carry my longer lenses in a different bag or pouches in a vest.  Because of this purchase, I am going to keep an eye out for Case Logic products.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice Bag but too small for me;I ordered this bag after reading the reviews of the types of cameras it fit I thought it would fit my panasonic lumix fz200 with room to spare. My camera fits, barely. I can hardly squeeze a spare battery and three filters in the side pockets. It is a very nice bag, I am going to see if there is a larger one by the same people. If you have a super zoom this is just too small.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Make sure of the size;Bought this as a quick carry bag for a Nikon D3100 DSLR and in my opinion, it didn't really fit.  According to the product information they claim it would fit that model and MOST DSLR cameras.  Well it really didn't fit mine.  Fortunately it fit a Panasonic Lumix perfectly.  If it wasn't for that I would have rated it even lower.  The case itself is just OK, nothing special just basic material that should hold up to just moderate wear.  It really doesn't have much room for anything other than the camera, spare battery and SD card.  So if you just need a case on the run this works OK as long as your equipment fits in it.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Too small for LUMIX DC-FZ-80;Case logic make excellent bags so in terms of quality, a good bag. I can’t use this for my Lumix FZ-80. Camera is larger than expected and bag is smaller than expected.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Small but nice;This is a pretty small case, although it's perfect for a small point and shoot (I use the Fujifilm FinePix S4800 and it fits perfectly).  The padding is good and seems to protect the camera well.  The top load makes the camera very accessible.  The two side pockets are small but will fit batteries, straps, memory cards, etc.For the price, this is a nice, albeit small, camera case.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect Case for my needs!;Case fits the D3300 equipped with the kit lens perfectly! Nice and snug while giving you two side pockets to slide in a filter or batteries. Inner lid pocket could be used to storage extra SD cards. There is a slot within the main camera compartment, but the camera leaves no room to place anything larger than a microfiber towel. This case matches my need perfectly as I am an avid hiker/camper that needs a compact camera case. Highly recommend for adventurers or beginners alike!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Case Logic DCB-304 camera bag;Bought this for my Nikon P510. It fits the camera, cable, extra batteries, and extra sd cards very well. It does become a tight fit when I stuff in the non-Nikon brand battery charger, which I do when I travel, but otherwise, I leave it out. It is a good quality camera bag that fits mega zoom cameras. If you want a lot of extra room for a lot more stuff, then this isn't the bag for you.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice and compact.;l like this holster as it is not too bulky. It fits my D5100 with a 35mm and 50mm lens without a hood. I would like a bigger size to fit the camera with either lens and its hoods.
4.0 out of 5 stars;It's smaller than I thought it would be;If I was going to buy additional equipment for my Fuji camera, there would be no room to store it. As I don't plan to do that, it's fine for my needs. I have enough room to store extra batteries and a spare SD card and the carry strap.I like that you can either carry it by its handle or attach the carry strap. For the price, it was worth it to me!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good bag for small camera;Bought the case for a Sony A6000 with kit lens and spare batteries plus charger.  Keeps everything together securely in a suitcase or backpack.  No room for extra lenses or other gear so go for the larger version if needed.  It is well made with solid zippers.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Buy a size up if you have a micro four-thirds camera;Looked like a decent camera case from the reviews on Amazon and YouTube, but I would definitely go with a bit larger size if you have a micro four-thirds camera. I have a Panasonic G7 with lens hood and it fits but very snug and with little room for anything of bulk on the inside. The outer pockets may work for extra batteries though. The inside has little room for anything but flat media cards. I gave it three stars as it was advertised as an accessory for the G7, yet it is not a good size for it.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Very nice but will not hold Canon SX50 HS;"I bought a Canon SX50 HS camera from amazon along with their recommended camera bag. That amazon basics bag was too small to fit the camera in and so it got returned.I thought this bag which was 1/2"" wider would work and although I could force it in sideways it is still too tight. I'm returning it. I really like the Case Logic construction quality so I will look for their next larger size."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect size for Samsung NX1000.;I bought this product for the Samsung NX1000. Everything fits inside. I have:The camera body, the 20 - 50 mm lense that came with the camera, the flash, an extra batery, the charger and the cables. If you are buying an extra lens probably it won't fit inside.The fabrics are not really good and the belt is just to thin. probably too insecure for places where they can snatch your stuffs.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nicde size for the cost;I like it but wish it were a bit larger for all the chargers, UBS disk  and cords that  are needed for when you are finished shooting.  I carry a small spare camera just in case something happens to the big camera
3.0 out of 5 stars;Okay for the price, Better for much smaller cameras;May return this or just use it as an accessory case, I haven't quite decided just yet. But the bag is far smaller in person that I thought it would be and maybe that's my own fault for not looking at the dimensions thoroughly. But I have to take the lens off my camera because only the body will fit into the bag. Also the side pockets are very small as well, so I don't have much room in them to hold my lens or even my flash. Like the rest of my items I ordered, the shipping was lightning fast. I just wish it had more room.
4.0 out of 5 stars;If you want to carry accessories better upsize but it is well constructed;Too small for my Sony A6300 with factory lens plus an extra zoom lens.  If you want to carry accessories better upsize but it is well constructed.  I like the two side zipper pockets.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Okay for a really small DSLR like Sony 6000, etc.;If you are planning on carrying more than the camera and a short lens, skip this one!  Nice for the size and protects what you have in it.  Upgraded to a larger one for the wife.  I'm like a lot of photographers, lots of bags to find the one that works for you!  When I had the Sony system, this worked, but barley.  Now back with Canon, so a much larger and better build bag in my arsenal now!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice case, well made.;I ordered this case along with a Fuji camera which I got at the same time. It was suggested on the purchase page. While it is a really well made and protective case, the it was too small for the camera I ordered which has a wide angle optical zoom lens. I am keeping it for other cameras I have but will be buying a different one for my new camera.
4.0 out of 5 stars;To small but Really good;It was a bit small but my camera fits perfectly... Thought it was like a purse but there is not even space for a wallet if my camera is there. But else the case is really good quality and I was actually surprised by that
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect for travel.;I love this case for the traveling we'll be doing with our Nikon 1. I wanted a larger case than the one it came with (by Nikon, go figure) so that I could keep everything from my power cord to the cables contained. I would not recommend getting it as a carrying case, but to protect a camera, definitely. It's kind of boxy and awkward to strap around a neck or to the hip. That's why it's perfect to store or take with you on a journey in your bag without worry. Love Case Logic. Always good quality cases.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great bag but not for hybrid or slr cameras.;Though a lot of customers recommend this bag for the Fuji FinepixHS 50 i personally found it to be too small. I have to force my way into the bag to retrieve my camera which is not ideal in high action scenarios. I personally will recommend a slightly larger bag that willalso accommodate external flashes and batteries etc.
5.0 out of 5 stars;perfect fit;small and perfect to just carry a camera, an extra battery and couple of sd cards on the go.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Very good protection;My canon sx530 fots perfect.  Looks very secure.  Thank you
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great case;I love my case just perfect for my camera
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good Bang for the Buck!;This is a more then fair priced camera bag that works for smaller bridge cameras like my Nikon Coolpix 520 and accessories. I only wanted a decent bag to protect my camera from dust and damage, while it is being carried in a small backpack. This one does that chore easily, and yet, should I decide to just grab the camera and run minus the backpack...by itself it is great.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Durable;Perfect size for Canon camera. Love the extra pockets for chargers and batteries.
4.0 out of 5 stars;it was better than I expected plus;was looking for a slimmer design, but I couldn't find it online and so I ordered this insteadfrom the photo I didn't expect it to be as slim as I wanted, but when I got it, it was better than I expectedplus, it looked very well made and protective, and fit my Nikon DSLR camera and accessories perfectly
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nicely built case -- smaller than it looks in the pictures;"Nice case, but no fit with my camera.  I put the question of fit to the Amazon Experts and a couple of them offered opinions based on zero experience.  Why do these people even bother?  But I'm sure it will fit some piece of gear some day and it was mighty inexpensive, so it waits on the shelf.  No thanks to the ""experts."""
3.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't fit my camera straps. :(;I was very excited to receive this as I hate the big, bulky camera cases that most people are stuck with when owning a larger camera with detachable lenses.  It is very small and compact and fits my Nikon camera well BUT it does not fit my camera strap that it attached to my camera.  I'm going to keep this as I still like it.  I just can't zip top close so I'll just have to carry it with the top open or partially zipped with my strap to one side.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good compact case.;Fits my Sony a6000 very well. I can fit the camera with the stock 16-50mm lens and the 55-210mm lens at the same time. Pockets aren't huge, but I can fit a couple extra batteries and the charger without much trouble. It's about as compact as you can get for the capacity. Has held up well after a few long trips.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great Case;I love case logic.  Bought two of these for my adult kids for Christmas and they look great. They are small, just enough room to hold a camera, cord and batteries so make sure thats all the room you need before ordering.  I especially like the divider inside and the options to carry it. strap, handle or belt loop.  Over all, worth the $10 I spent.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good case - wrong for me though.;I got this for my Nikon DSLR camera and it was too small - way too small.  But that's not the fault of the bag - that's my own fault for not measuring and taking into account the dimensions of the bag vs the camera.I do use the bag for other uses and it's good.  I like it.  No issues I could find. :)
4.0 out of 5 stars;Very nice camera case;Very nice case but just a little too small for my Nikon D3300 and all of its accessories (a couple SD cards, a couple batteries and the computer hook-up cords). Very well made and organized, I just need something a little larger.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Smaller than expected but perfect size;It is much smaller than expected. I have a large Fuji camera and at first sight thought this would have to be returned due to size. However, I tried it and my camera actually fits just right when it is standing up right. Would recommend due to it being the perfect fit for even my camera. Also, kind of excited not to have such a large bag.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Bag is a little stiff, but works for the ...;Bag is a little stiff, but works for the camera, shoulder strap could be a little longerso that the camera could fall at your hip instead of under your armpit
3.0 out of 5 stars;... it is too small and I have no other good use for it;this came up as an option for my new Nikon Coolpix 900  it is too small and I have no other good use for it.  Good deal I guess if you have a smaller camera.  I am reversing my recent opinion. Though it is tight and a bit cumbersome to get into the case, it does fit. So if compact is important to you my cool pix 900 does fit. It would be nice if it was just a little bit bigger.
3.0 out of 5 stars;it's OK;The case is fine, everything they said it would be.  There is a fine line in equipment between just right and too small.  It varies with each person.  I would have liked just a couple of more cubic inches in the main pocket, and a little larger side pockets.  That being said, it is for a bridge camera, and the point is having a smaller bulk to lug around.  For myself and the camera I have it is just a little too tight, for me personally.  I think I will adapt and not look for something else.  The quality of the product is excellent as is the design.
3.0 out of 5 stars;too small;I thought the number of positive reviews on this bag was very misleading. While it fits a large digital camera nicely(I have the sony cybershot hx100), that is about all it fits. I guess if you want a bag that is light and you don't want to be able to fit anything else into it than it is a good bag. I have no problems with the construction. it is fine. I personally want to be able to fit in my charger, etc. when I carry my camera around. I have cords hanging out the sides because I can't zip them all the way up. This is really frustrating. My charger and usb cords aren't very large either. Probably going to buy another bag.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Dad Approved for 6 year old usage.;this was the recommended bag for a Nikon S33. It's a little big for that, more than enough room for a small point and shoot camera and charger. Bag itself is of decent quality - it's stood up to frequent interactions with a six year old.
5.0 out of 5 stars;For Nikon COOLPIX B600, Works perfectly;My Nikon COOLPIX B600 fits in this perfectly with some room for other stuff.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Case Logic always delivers;Laptop bag, camera bag, hard drive bag...I always go for Case Logic. Top quality, you will never be dissapointed, designs are always flawless and comes with storage places you did not even know you needed until you see them, and most important your cool electronics will be secure and well packed. This one in particular fits a medium interchangeable lense or fixed lens camera like my Nikon Coolpix L110 and it even has room for the wall battery charger at the bottom. Does Case Logic have a regular buyer discount card???
4.0 out of 5 stars;more like my old 35mm camera bags;The online picture led me to believe it was larger, more like my old 35mm camera bags.  This is more like a camera case,  yet it will fit on my belt!  As all my order was a Christmas gift to myself, I look forward to the day after.  The case is well stitched and padded.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Wonderful bag;This is the nicest bag for a camera. It's has lots of compartments that make it so nice for carrying a camera cloth, batteries,charger,  and cable. The only reason I give it a 4 star is that it is on the small side. A little hard to get into the main compartment. But I'm sure the specs said the Measurements. My fault.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Very sturdy -- and fits!;This just barely fits my Lumix FZ200 camera. But it does make it a compact carry bag. Enough room for the attached sunshield but you'll need to be careful not to drop it down on a hard surface. Batteries fit, too. Maybe a few filters. Certainly not a thick printed manual. I've got to test it a bit more before deciding to keep it.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great Little Camera Bag for the Price;I almost got a bigger one after reading some of the previous reviews but I am glad I didn't.  My camera (Nikon Coolpix L810) fits snug but it protected and it is not too bulky to pack around.  Lots of pockets and I love the little inner on under the top for all my SD cards.  Overall very pleased with this bag.
4.0 out of 5 stars;the bag is great quality and everything;I bought this for my Nikon D3200 to travel. the bag is great quality and everything, my camera fits well, the top is just pushing on the lens a tiny bit, so I wish it was like a centimeter or two taller. Other than that, this bag is great.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Too big for my camera!;I bought this bag, as the Amazon page recommended it for my Canon PowerShot SX510hs, a compact ultrazoom point-and-shoot, so I bought it.  However, the main compartment was WAY too big for my Canon! And there are no adjustable dividers to make it more secure.  This is a nice bag, though, seemed durable and good quality.  But, I had to return because it just wasn't what I was looking for!  If you have a compact ultra-zoom, like a Canon Powershot or a Nikon Coolpix L830, I'd look for something smaller (I got the LowePro Edit 100 bag for my Canon).
5.0 out of 5 stars;JUST the right size;A half an inch in any dimension would have been too small. It fits my Nikon P500 PERFECTLY! There is JUST enough room for my NEEDED carry alongs. You know Batteries, SD cards, Charger. I have to give it a 5star because every thing fits and perfectly! Though if any smaller at all it would have been too small. So If all you want to cary in it are those things I mentioned it is PERFECTLY FINE!!! Quality is very good. It will last a long time! Happy with purchase and recommend!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice small bag;Purchased it for my new Nikon P510.  The 510 fits snuggly with room for a couple of extra batteries and a charger in the side pocket.  It may be a little too tight for my liking.  If I have it to do over, I would buy a bigger bag for my P510, but it is a nice bag for the money.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Holds my camera without being too bulky;I store my Nikon Coolpix L810 in this case, along with the USB connector and the red/yellow/white TV adapter.  The main compartment has plenty of room for the camera, and could hold a bit more (e.g., some SD cards) if I wanted.  The two side pockets are large enough for the two cables.The material is substantial, as are the zippers.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Decent Size For Smaller Digital Camers;Good Room for camera (DSC-H200), but not too much room for anything else.  There are side pockets, as well as a pocket in the top, but once the camera is in there isn't much wiggle room for much else other than a memory card or two.  Overall though, it is constructed very well and offers a lot of padding for the camera.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great bag;I purchased this bag for my Nikon coolpix b700 and it fits perfectly. I can carry the charging cables on the side pockets. Not a big fan of the inside red design but i can deal with it.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Alright;It does what I want it to do. I have an Olympus OM-D E-M10. It fits perfectly for just the camera, batteries, camera cards, and filters. However, I recently got another lens, and everything doesn't fit so perfectly anymore. I wish I had gotten something a little bigger.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice Case;Smaller size, but large enough to hold my G15 with attached filter adapter tube.  It fits with the camera on its back or laid in sideways.  And it also is just roomy enough, with pockets on the sides, to hold the other little extras that go along with the camera.  It looks like it should hold up well in the long run.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice case. Wish it was a bit bigger.;A good case. Wish it was just a little bigger. My Panasonic FZ300 fits nice and snug, but there's no place to tuck the lens hood, and the battery charger is also pushing it.
5.0 out of 5 stars;It fits like a dream;Bought this to house my Canon M100. It fits like a dream. Enough room to put some other things in it, but not so much that I'm lugging around a huge bag for no reason. I got this specifically to throw in my backpack on hiking trips.
5.0 out of 5 stars;A great value and a durable case;I'm using this for a Canon Powershot SX-50 HS.  It fits the camera perfectly and I use the side pocket to store cleaning wipes and the USB cable.  The padding in the case does offer some protection from damage if dropped.  The case seems to be pretty durable and well constructed.  The zippers all work just fine and the handle is solid.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good value for the money;"Was pleasantly surprised with the compartments, roominess etc.  Decently builtand nice looking bag.  Must comment on the back side ""belt loop"" (?).  It does not seem like it is strong enough if it were to be used repeatedly.  Then again, I haven't heard any complaints from my camera, so it must be comfy in there.  :)"
4.0 out of 5 stars;Sturdy case although it does not seem to protect a ...;Sturdy case although it does not seem to protect a camera from a large drop. But this price is about right unless you want a professional-grade expensive one.It has many compartments and it feels sturdy enough to take shock up to an extent. It does not look or feel flimsy at all.Definitely would recommend.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great value for small cameras;I have a Kodak Pixpro and lost my original case. Tight inside but it works. This is definitely for small cameras.  The zippered pockets are also tight and cannot hold much but it worked for the charger cord during my recent vacation. The price was also very good.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Nice Day Trip Pouch for My Canon EOS M50;Nice size case for my Canon EOS M50, spare battery, and a few filters.  The case seems to be well made and is well padded.  Not a real gadget bag, but a nice day trip pouch for my camera.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great camera case....great price!;I got a couple of these camera cases for 2 super zoom bridge cameras I have and they fit in this case great! I had room to still put a few sets of batteries in one of 2 side pockets and spare SD cards in the other pocket. Nice quality and good sized for super zoom bridge cameras & at a great price.....nothing bad with this case!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Depends on your intended use.;Most definitely a tight fit for the Nikon SX40, which is not a big camera at all. Even getting the camera in and out of the central pocket (with all other pockets empty) requires a tight grip, often prying off the lens cover or pressing buttons unnecessarily. Under tighter conditions, you barely have room for the charger, the interface cable, a usb-sized card reader and an extra battery. On the other hand, I suppose, if you were to precisely want to travel without calling too much attention to your stuff, this might do as a second bag to be used for those occasions-- but certainly not as your only camera case.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not for Nikon D3100(any DSLR);I bought this bag last week.The quality is superb,everything is pretty good.The only Problem is,this case is pretty small fro Nikon D3100 or for any of the DSLR camera.I checked the dimesnions of the Case and Camera as well,I Bought both together.Dimesions wise it looks it will fit,but its very smallI was able to put my camera vertically up.Screen down and Lense up.So I will have to pull my camera outside the case with Lens whihc I really dont like.Long and Short of it is dont buy this case for DSLRsQuality: ****(FOur Stars)Size: * (One Star)I hope this review helps
4.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect! Camera fits tightly in center pocket and side ...;Perfect! Camera fits tightly in center pocket and side pockets are large enough to actually be useful. There's another pocket inside the lid of case, I keep extra batteries in there. This case is small enough not to be cumbersome yet large enough to adequately serve it's intended purpose. Nice!
4.0 out of 5 stars;A very good camera case.;This is smaller than it looks in the photo, but was a perfect size for my Panasonic digital camera.  It has quite a few pockets to store extra small accessories (like batteries and data cards).  The main section fits my camera and strap, along with extra batteries and battery charger.  I recommend this case.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Been using for a couple of years with my advanced ...;Been using for a couple of years with my advanced compact Canon Sure Shot SX-50 camera, which is about the size of many DSLR cameras. Small enough to be handy, yet carries extra sd cards, batteries, cleaners, even the charger.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Too small;It’s way smaller than I expected. My rebel t3 barely fits in it. And it doesn’t sit flat if my rebel is all the way in and it’s zipped shut. Because it’s sitting on the lens! No room for anything besides the camera, not even the strap!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Solid, light but a bit bulky;Solid yet light, this case is a little too bulky for me (I like to be able to tuck the camera case into my backpack when traveling). On the other hand, it has enough extra space available to double as a purse (room for a wallet and small things like keys) and is very comfortable to carry.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Christmas surpises;This along with the camera will make a brilliant gift
5.0 out of 5 stars;This was a great case for my new camera;This was a great case for my new camera! It looks big in the picture but it is very portable. I love that it has so many pockets and areas to hold various parts of a camera, and when I didn't want to carry a whole lot, it fit my camera, charger, phone and cards so I could carry it also like a mni purse but keep my camera safe. Highly recommend it
4.0 out of 5 stars;Not bad for an inexpensive bag;Fits my Canon camera pretty well, though the interior could use a more defined spot so the camera would fit more snugly.  Allows camera to be put inside in several different ways (pro) but may let it move around inside too much (con).
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great for the money;Fits my high-zoom Nikon very well with plenty of room for the camera's strap, batteries and more. The shoulder strap of the bag itself is long enough to be useful and the carry handle on top is surprisingly convenient.I haven't put it through the ringer yet, but I bet it'll hold up just fine for my casual shooting.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Serviceable Case;It's a sturdy, serviceable case that, as described in the copy, fits my compact system camera.  The only drawback is the manufacturer's logo badge.  When I have a moment I'm going to take a seam ripper to it. I don't like to be a billboard unless I get paid for it.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice case;Nice case, but it looked bigger in the picture. My Sony Cybershot fits in there fairly well but accessories are a challenge. Will need an additional bag, or a bigger bag. The quality of this one is really high, so if you have just a camera, or a smaller camera and accessories, you will be happy with it.
3.0 out of 5 stars;... my previous camera bag which I had bought at best buy and loved it so I ordered the same ...;I had recently lost my previous camera bag which I had bought at best buy and loved it so I ordered the same one on line but the over all cunstruction was not the same. The inside pocket is flimsy on my new bag but the one I had bought in store was more rigid and had elastic holding the seperator on. Im a little disappointed because it doesnt function exactly the same, though its the same model bag.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Its very comfortable to carry and durable;I use it to store my camera and its cables and works just fine. It doesn`t lose it`s quality and also the price you pay is nothing compared to what you get. Recommended Purchase
3.0 out of 5 stars;nice and compact but a bit expensive;Received my DCB304 bag today, and while I'm overall pleased, I felt that I had overpaid--- any price over $10 is high for this bag.  Bag would be ideally-priced between $5-10.The bag barely fits my Nikon p520, a battery, a 32gb memory card, and recharger.  The bottom/base of the bag doesn't have sufficient insulation and so the Nikon camera (resting on its side inside the bag) is not well-cushioned. Thus, when placing the bag down onto the ground or table, care needs to be taken to gently lay the bag down.  Otherwise, the camera will feel any impact/pressure of any bag drop.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nearly great!;Ordered to carry my new Fujifilm NS20.  Looks, storage areas,quality of materials and construction were all great.  The major shortcoming was in the interior size.  The case was touted as perfect for superzoom point and shoot cameras.  However it was a very tight fit for my NS20 thus making storing and retreiving a chore.  Make it a little bigger!
4.0 out of 5 stars;On the small side;Using it for my Nikon Coolpix P520 and it's a snug fit. The divider is useless. The side pockets are useful for the extra battery and memory cards. There's a another zippered pocket inside but I find that with the camera inside I can only use it for the lens cleaning cloth. The case is well made and sturdy.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Safety and versatility for your camera;The case is full of pockets, protection, and easily holds everything you need for the camera, such as spare batteries, the connection wires and other odds and ends that you need for great pictures.  Zippers work easily and the case can be used on a belt or with the included carry strap.  It appears to be water resistant and it just looks good in general. I would recommend this for cameras and other items when you are taking an overnight trip somewhere.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great little camera bag and very well constructed;Great little camera bag and very well constructed. I purchased it for my Kodak Pixpro AZ401 and the fit is perfect for me. All the extra compartments are very handy to have also. I highly recommend this case.Ron T
3.0 out of 5 stars;Very small to fit camera and lenses together!;It is a good bag! Really small! But I could barely fit my Nikon D3300 in it. I have a 18-55mm and 35mm lenses, and both lenses are too big to fit inside with the camera in, or on the side pockets! I had to put the camera first and push it all the way down into the middle pocket, and then put fit the lenses barely on top of the camera, which is not the best thing to do!
5.0 out of 5 stars;My Nikon fits perfectly. The inside case can be ...;My Nikon fits perfectly. The inside case can be attached to the camera. You can also decide if you want to turn the inside case around allowing the Velcro to hold it securely inside the larger case. There is enough room for three lenses (one on the camera). There are zip pouches to hold extra batteries, lens caps, and a few more essential items.  One pouch is large enough to carry your medical marijuana needs.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Keeps camera snug.... with ample space ...;Keeps camera snug....with ample space on top...perhaps the case could have been made not so tall. The pockets on each side are handy for holding the usb cable and batteries...but it's a struggle to put in the pockets and to close. For the price...it's ok. Wish it was more compact.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Very nice, especially for the price :D;While the picture does not show exactly how... compact... this item is, it works perfectly for my Canon Powershot S50, and it carries absolutely everything else that I need or would need, such as two extra batteries, a charger, screen wipes, screen protectors, lenses, etc. I also love the fact that it has a belt loop as well as a shoulder strap (double the protection for, say, outdoorsy types). Plush but durable interior and rugged exterior. Don't feed your mao guai after midnight.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Functional and good quality;Fits the Sony alpha 6000 camera. No extra room for additional lens attachment. The zipper compartments are nice to organize SD cards. It's good quality for the price, just a little smaller than expected.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Fantastic camera case;I bought this case to especially for my new Canon SX50.  It fits perfectly.  It's just big enough, not too big.  There are a few extra storage spaces to hold extra batteries, a lens filter, some lens cleaning supplies, a spare tripod plate.  The zippers and the entire case are sturdy--I can tell it won't break or wear out anytime soon.  It's compact so it's easy to just grab and go.  Just what I was looking for.
5.0 out of 5 stars;A good bag;Was searching for a bag in decent price everywhere and found this one on amazon. A good bag and very sufficient for the camera I have. There are lots of bags of the same size but very costly. Those costly bags will be better in quality than this one as I saw in stores too. But this bag is more than sufficient and secure too for the camera. Very good looking from outside. Not sure why people would spend on other costly bags.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Excellent case;Perfect for my Canon SXHS50. Batteries, charger and other things find the perfect space in this case.  Good quality, good design and colors.UPDATED:After 1 year using this case, my camera and the case are as new. I'm very happy with this product. Inside on it, I'm carrying (in specific order) the following:- SX50HS Canon Camera- 1 Extra battery- Battery Charger- Canon remote controller- Small size camera tripod- Lens accessory kit (from Goya)
4.0 out of 5 stars;good case for a beginner as long as you're not ...;good case for a beginner as long as you're not carrying a lot of extra accessories, It`s a little small if you want to carry a lens hood or battery charger accessories extra batteries and so on and so on I would recommend it for a basic case to get stasted !!!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Compact and versatile;I bought this to go with a Nikon CoolPix L830. Its a nice little case. Not too bulky, fits the camera well, but has enough room for some extra batteries and other small things. A couple outside pockets are useful. Seems well-made, but I've only had it for a short time.
2.0 out of 5 stars;NOT THE BEST CASE FOR A FUJI PIX HS25EXR !!!;"I purchased this case based on Amazon's suggestion as a ""package"".  Boy was this a mistake!  The case probably best suits a camera that has a lens that is flush with the camera's body ... not for Fuji Pix HS25EXR.  It is extremely tight to pull out and I do not feel that being such a tight fit that it would offer much protection to the camera stored inside.  Instead, I am storing my old Pentax camera in it since my Pentax has no accessories and using my old Mohawk camera bag for my Fuji until I find something that would better serve my needs.  What I do like about this bag is that the pockets have zippers.  If you have a Fuji Pix HS25EXR or a camera with a similar body style, I would strongly recommend to avoid this bag UNLESS you have skinny childlike fingers and do not plan to store accessories like cable cords, a mini tripod, and/or batteries in its inner upper zipper section and its outer two zipper sections."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Camera Bag;This is a little smaller than I expected.  Says it's for a Canon DX50 (a fairly large camera).  It fits inside, but just barely.  You may want to consider a larger bag if you carry a lot of accessories with the camera.  If you don't mind cramming camera in and squeezing out, it's fine.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Love this one;I wanted a small bag for my canon rebel and this fits it perfectly with the stock lens. Been using and loving this bag for months. No longer have to worry about my camera just floating around my bag or carrying a big camera bag that was bulky. Love this one.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Was recommended for the Canon SX 50 but.....;While this case has lots of side bag space, it is really too small to hold anything but the camera. I tried several orientations of slamming the camera, and it either won't fit, or it pushes into the side bags too far.I had hoped to put in 3 battery packs, the charger, camera and extra SD cards.The charger won't fit, and the battery packs (one in the camera) is very tight.  Still need a bag for filters (cannot store the camera in the bag with filters installed - too tight of a fit to feel comfortable with) and the charger.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works great!;Bought this for my dad's Nikon Coolpix B600 camera, and it fits perfectly. He'd previously had a larger DSLR camera with a larger accompanying bag, and this one is much more manageable.
3.0 out of 5 stars;does not fit canon sx40;"After reading several reviews, I ordered this when I ordered my Canon SX40. This case does not properly fit this camera. When putting the camera in and out, it would tug on either the lens cap or the rubber eye rest. It fits, sort of, but just not well. I am returning it. (The case itself is okay, not overly padded, and the zipper seems cheap.) I bought this Lowepro case after looking at it in person and it fits great, with room for cords, battery, etc. A bit more money but worth it.
Lowepro Rezo 110 AW Camera Bag"
4.0 out of 5 stars;Super nice, padded;Super nice, padded, compact, but just a little but small for the Fuji S1 w the adapter ring and filter....super tight fit but it'll be ok.  Wish the strap was padded.I think this case is better for a point n shoot  I wish it was about another 4 inches larger.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good budget case;My camera fits very snug in this case. I knew that it would be snug based on the product description. The side pockets are very small, but I was able to store an extra battery and memory stick. It does a great job of protecting my camera, but I prefer the older model. I had this bag in a previous model and it seemed to fit things better. I only replaced it because the zippers went bad after a few years. The camera strap in comfortable, but I ended up replacing it out of personal preference.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good starter bag;This bag fits my Nikon D3000 perfectly but if your the type of person that likes an area for your lens separately I don't recommend. I like that it's small and light. Its cute. It's great to take to events and to activities. I just wish I didn't have to shove in my Nikon strap all the time...that's the only hassle for me.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Pricey for such a small case;pictures are very deceiving. It's not just compact, its super compact! my point and shoot camera(closer looking to a dslr ) barely fits in.pros: lots of pockets, space for lens cap, battery/ battery charger, usb cable.cons: very compact, barely fits the point and shoot camera. it has a divider in it which is useless since no enough space to keep anything else.Overall: small and VERY compact and is only good for small point and shoot cameras not for cameras like the Canon SX50 etc.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Don't waste your money!;A month after I purchased this camera from Amazon,  Best Buy sold it for 25.00 less than what I paid and it included the memory card and the case which I had to purchase seperately.  I am SO disappointed with the performance of this camera's zoom lens.  Outdoors photos are okay but not great.  Indoors are terrible!  I tried to take pictures at a kindergarten graduation and took some of the worst photos I've ever taken in my life!  I was only 25 feet from the stage and no matter what setting I used (and I tried then ALL)the photos were blurry and too dark.  I am not a novice.  I own four other cameras and my kids call me MAMARATZI.  I've even been the photographer at a couple of weddings.  I used my Sony for the weddings and the pictures were great. I just expected so much more for the money I paid for this camera.  If you are going to spend almost 400.00 on a new camera don't buy this one!  I should have put another 300.00 into it and bought a Nikon DSLR.
4.0 out of 5 stars;and I chose this case because it's recommended when I ordered the Nikon Coolpix L840;Ordered this for a Nikon Coolpix L840.  The bag seemed to be very well made.  However, it's a tad too big for my camera, and I chose this case because it's recommended when I ordered the Nikon Coolpix L840.
4.0 out of 5 stars;A Good Case for My Camera;Perfect case for my Nikon Coolpix 510. It cushions the camera carefully, but the camera is still readily available when needed. The case has enough room for storage of extra batteries and cards, and I can even keep a change purse inside when necessary.
3.0 out of 5 stars;"Not adequate for a ""High Zoom"" camera";"This is a very light bag offering min protection for a ""High Zoom Camera"". My camera did not fit in with any room or adequate protection. I would recommend a larger bag with more padding and room. A padded and solid bottom in a bag, offers more protection if the camera is dropped.  For a light camera, it is probably ok. I returned it."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Quality Carrying Case !;Nice carrying case for my Nikon Digital Camera. Plenty of room for the extra's to store away. Recommend it highly !
4.0 out of 5 stars;Fits my Canon AE-1 pretty snug though;A little smaller than I expected, especially the side pockets. Fits my Canon AE-1 pretty snug though. Other than that the material is pretty sturdy and it's a pretty nice little case
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not for those who don't pack lightly;"First of all: GizGalaxy seems to be selling Case Logic's rejects.  The seams are crooked on the front detail and so is the Case Logic Brand Logo.I bought the bag to protect my Canon SX30 IS when hauling it (in my backpack) on trips.  No it does not have room for ALL of your cords and ALL of your extra batteries, but it has enough storage space for [what I consider to be] a few of the necessities. (USB cable, extra SD cards and 1 extra battery) 
Case Logic DCB-304 High/Fixed Zoom Camera Case (Black)"
3.0 out of 5 stars;nice product, too small;this product appears to be great, but I missed the entire description of the size. I have a pentax KX, a lot of lenses and small materials, and there is no way any of it is going to fit into this case. the camera, by itself, fits, but no lens. this is a case for a basic consumer camera. I scrolled down the page and saw the dimensions, but it would be nice to have a list of what cameras actually fit in here.also, shipping it back to return it was almost the price of what I paid!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Light, comfortable, and plenty of space;I really like this bag. I can put my Nikon Coolpix L820 and a small tripod in the biggest section (separated from the camera with a division), and still have a lot of space in the exterior pockets for 8 batteries, money and my cellphone. It is light and comfortable either if you hang it in your shoulder or handle it with your hand. It protects the camera very well, and the material seems very durable. Great transaction.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Too small;Too small
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice bag;Nice bag, good quality, but not as well padded as another I have. Has good compartments and pockets, light and will fit on your pants belt so a good one for hiking and mountaineering. However, has no place to accommodate lens extensions or if camera is mounted with tulip flower lens hood and similar.
4.0 out of 5 stars;It is a fine camera bag but not for the FinePix SL;price is right.  I believe that it is a little to small for my camera and extra batteries and charger.  I purchased the FinePix SL 1000  and the fit is a little to tight for me. It is a fine camera bag but not for the FinePix SL 1000
4.0 out of 5 stars;Small but nice.;It's actually kinda small. It just fits my Sony a6000 with 35mm lens. It's OK if you're storing the camera in a backpack. But it won't hold much. It's well made.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great Camera Case.;It looks like it will be perfect for my Nikon Coolpix L340.  The cushioning seems adequate and the camera fits in snugly but with room for accessories.
3.0 out of 5 stars;NOT for DSLRs;The bag itself is nice but I triple checked the reviews to make sure it would fit my Nikon D3100 but it didn't. Not even with the lense off. This bag is kind of in between a DSLR and a point & shoot. It'd be huge for your little camera but it's just barely to small for a DSLR. Overall the bag was nice, lots of pockets, material was good but the reviews as well as the product description aren't very precise on what type of camera this bag is for.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Bought it for my Nikon D3400. The camera does ...;Bought it for my Nikon D3400. The camera does fit in but its a bit of a hassle to close it with the camera sling/belt.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great to carry lenses!;Size is great for carrying medium size lenses (I could fit a rokinon fisheye and a nikon 50mm f/1.8G) and still has room for batteries, filters or stuff like that. It is also of very firm estructure and the quality seems long lasting.
4.0 out of 5 stars;perfect case;I  purchased this case for my new camera.  Saw it for more money at a local store.  This case came in handy  recently while traveling.  It had plenty  of storage room for extras  like batteries and memory cards. It protected my camera from a rain down pour.
5.0 out of 5 stars;This is a perfect carrying case for my Canon T4i and one lens;This is a perfect carrying case for my Canon T4i and one lens.  I just got back from a trip to Italy and bought this specifically for the trip.  It work exactly in the manner I purchased it for...easy to get in and out of and with minimal weight to carry it with.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Pleased with the purchase;"An excellent case. Plenty of room for my Nikon L840 with extra space for accessories such as batteries, cables, food bars, etc. Plenty of padding and well constructed. My measurements: W = 6"", H = 6.5"", D = 4.5"" (approximate). Two outside zippered pockets, sectioned storage in main compartment for small misc. items. An excellent buy."
4.0 out of 5 stars;I love it!;Great use!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Case Logic DCB-304;This case is remarkable and the low cost of the bag, makes this one of the best purchases, I have made.  The bag has alot of room within to storage alot of your camera attachments along with the storage of the camera.  The Olympus SP-810 fits greatly within and safe from breakage!  I shopped for numerous bags and I am happy to say, it is the perfect fit for all my needs!
4.0 out of 5 stars;using it for samsung nx300m;Like the case very much.  I use it for my samsung nx300m.  Gave it 4 stars because it's not as flexible as I would like it to be.  Somewhat of a tight fit with the lens, but I wanted a compact case and don't regret the purchase.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Fit's Panasonic DMC-FZ35 Camera;Fit's my Panasonic DMC FZ35 camera and a few accessories. Has a belt loop, but I think it might be a little on the large size to wear on my belt. It also has a shoulder strap too. It does what I want it to do, protects my camera and has a little spare room for an extra battery and charger.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good;I use it often and it holds the camera in very snuggly. It is durable and protects the camera on drops.The charger that came with the camera does not fit in the side pockets so that is alitte disconcerning. I would reccomend it to anyone with this type of camera. Kodak easyshare 2990.
4.0 out of 5 stars;needed a case;Got a canon D3100 as a gift and needed a case to protect it, so I decided to try this one. Shipping was fast so that's a plus. Fitting wise with some slight fidgeting it fits the camera exact but there's still room in the pockets for flashdrives and memory cards
4.0 out of 5 stars;Decent case but too small for my Panny FZ-30;This will make a nice case for one of my other cameras, but it's too small for my panny FZ-30 (I got the Panny leather case also sold here which is perfect).  It is well made and has a lot of nice features as described in the other reviews here so 4 stars overall.Nice value for the price asked.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Well built, Good small size.;I use to have a camera bag from an old 1970's pentax 35mm I was using and it was huge.  This new camera bag is just the thing for my Canon SX500is camera.  It fits in nice and snug and the case is well padded.  All zippers and stitching are superb.  For the price of this case I was not expecting much, but it surprised me when I got it.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good overall but still kind of big to be considered ...;Good overall but still kind of big to be considered 'compact'.  Worked well for transportation storage but a bit bulky for carrying around taking photos.

4.0 out of 5 stars;I like this case;I like this case.. the problem is that it fits my Canon T3i exactly... there is barely space for my charger in there. Fortunately I'm not interested in carrying around anything else so I am keeping it.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good things come in small packages;The case is small in size, but I don't have a lot of camera gear so that's not a problem for me.  There are plenty of compartments to store cables and extra batteries.  My camera fits snuggly into the main compartment.  It's easy to tote around and I've stored it easily in the overhead bin on an airplane next to my carry-on.  This case has worked well for me.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Quality;This case fits my camera perfectly, it is a little smaller than I expected. However, it is a very nice case with a lot of small pockets for your camera accessories. This makes it easy to carry extra batteries, sd cards, and anything else you may need. Glad I got this!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Camera case;"I bought this because I could afford it and it seemed to be adequate for what I need.  It is a good case, I'm wondering how efficient it will be using it on a ""tourist"" trip.  Limited side compartments but that is also good.  No need to accumulate extra weight."
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect for the price;I bought it for my new Nex-F3. The bag is well made. Quite sturdy build and has many pockets that can hold all the accessories of the camera. Only one minus is that the base is a bit thin with not very reliable cushion. But it's not a big deal and can be reinforced with a piece of cardboard. Overally I am totally satisfied with this bag! Recommended for compact systems owners!
4.0 out of 5 stars;companion gift;bought to hold new camera and accessories.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good camera case.;This case fits my Fuji Sl300 very well and is of pretty good quality.  My charger is a little big for it and does not quite fit into it with the camera, but I like the side pockets for other supplies.  It is an attractive and very useful case.
4.0 out of 5 stars;It fits the fz70 lumix 60x optical zoom camera;It fits my fz70 camera perfectly. There are 2 pockets for memory cards and  extra 2 bateries
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not quite what I expected for My SX50 HS;"Since it was listed with the Camera (Which I LOVE) I really expected it to be a ""Fitted"" Case.  It is well padded, has two side pockets, and is well constructed.  I can put my Camera into it, but not easily, and with the Neck strap attached it becomes harder yet.  I am looking for a replacement and will make sure I try my Camera in it before buying. I did not return it because I was going to be traveling and needed something for the Camera."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Smaller than I thought so it doesn't really work for ...;Smaller than I thought so it doesn't really work for what I bought it for.  But it is a well made little bag that my husband now uses.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good bag.;Thought it was going to be a bit bigger. I thought my Nikon D5300 would fit a little better in it. The bags size makes it comfortable to carry everywhere. Built quality is great.
5.0 out of 5 stars;You want your camera to be safe by Case Logic.;This case is really tough.  I had a motorcycle accident which put me in the hospital for three days. I was really worried about my camera. When I I got to my camera it was in perfect condition!  The case had been roughed up pretty good but the camera was well protected.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great camera bag;Well made well padded camera bag.  My cannon fits in nicely.  Has room inside for my charger and has a couple of small side zip compartments oh rhe sides.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Camera fit in well nice size not too big long strap;I didn't have any problems with this bag at first. Camera fit in well nice size not too big long strap.  just what I was looking for and wanted.  I have had it for a few months I think and the strap is unraveling it looks messing and old and I don't like the feel when the little pieces rub on me will feel like bugs when I am walking or taking pictures.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Dimensions not correct;This bag is nice but it does not conform to the given size.  My zoom point and shoot should have fit, but evidently the bag size is external dimensions and not internal dimensions available for the camera.  By the time you take in the padding, and internal pouches, my super zoom point and shoot fits so tightly and only lens down that I am afraid that the camera would be damaged with this case.  Case Logic needs to give correct internal dimensions especially for online sales.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Camera Case;This is an awesome basic camera case, perfect for a medium sized camera. It has pockets for extra batteries too! Perfect for any on the go outing that you want to bring your camera to!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Case Logic DCB-304, camera case;This is a high quality camera case, well constructed and does do a good job protecting it's contents. My only reason for not ranking it higher is that it turned out to be smaller than I had anticipated. This is not the fault of the manufacture, just that I couldn't visually review the case before hand.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not as big as thought;I bought this for my wife who I just bought a Nikon P510. Prior reviews said there was plenty of room for the camera, battery charger and additional battery and cables.  There is room , but it is very tight.  It is however compact and kept the camera safe and dry when raining out and for the money find it to be an ok purchase.  If you do not mind carrying a lot of additional things in the bag, than it is for you
5.0 out of 5 stars;This bag is great. It has lots of pockets for all of ...;This bag is great.  It has lots of pockets for all of the little pieces you need, it is made of good quality materials and is not too big or too small for my smaller DSLR.  I would definitely recommend this bag to anyone!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Smaller than the description implies;I don't know in what world this would hold any kind of SLR, but let's be clear: It won't, except for some very small ones. It's made well and all, but you need to appreciate its size. Check the photos -- that's my Canon 80D, which is a mid-sized consumer SLR with a standard lens. It ain't gonna fit.
3.0 out of 5 stars;okay;This was a gift for my wife so when she first saw the bag she thought it was to small for the camera but the camera dose fit. The bag has 2 side pockets with zippers and it has a small pocket inside with a zipper. Also it is a sung fit for the camera. I would recommend it as long as you have no extra stuff for the camera. The bag only holds the camera and wire's and an extra set of batteries and memory card.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great little case.;It's not quite as big as I hoped, but if is well built and holds all the basics. In the end it's probably what I really needed anyway.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Excellent bag for point and shoot;I bought a new Nikon AW130 and needed a new bag to match the size of the camera and charger. This Case Logic DCB-304 fit the bill.It is really well made as are my other half dozen Case Logic bags. I use them for small cameras and for laptops. Never had one fail. The zippers are superb.
3.0 out of 5 stars;squeezing my camera.;Oh well, i just bought a Fujifilm HS25EXR here, and i got this case as a sugestion.It's well constructed, feels like it will last a long time, but, it's too tight for my camera, i'm a bit afraid now, cause it seems that my cam will be damaged in the first opportunity, the side pockets are small too, so i can't carry too many stuff together with the camera.Bottom line: if you got a HS20/25/30, i would recomend a bigger case.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Well-made bag for Panasonic FZ35;The title says it all.  It is a small, well-made, well-padded, light-weight, rugged little bag that fits the Panasonic FZ35 (which we have) and similarly sized superzoom point-and-shoot cameras just fine.  There is room for the charger in one of the side pockets and it will hold a few small things like a spare battery (in the charger), some filters and a plug adaptor for foreign travel with a bit of room to spare.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Case Logic Case;It's a camera case, what can you say.  It holds the camera, extra batteries, and a bunch of SD cards.  It came with a shoulder strap.  I will know more when I get back from vacation, but it appears fine for my use.
4.0 out of 5 stars;its good. it was $12;meh, its a case. it works. its good. it was $12. If I had spent $100 I would have expected a lot more, however, if I had spent $5 I would have expected a lot less. Overall its doable. 4 stars.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Nikon Coolpix P900 doesn't fit well in this case.;This case is probably OK, but mine was purchased as a component in a bundle associated with the Nikon Coolpix P900. The P900 is a bit too large to fit comfortably in this case. If the case maintained the same design, but added a half inch to length, width, and depth it would fit the P900 very well, even with shoulder strap and a lens hood attached.
5.0 out of 5 stars;It fits nicely with some room to spare;I got this to use with my new Fujifilm FinePix S8600.  It fits nicely with some room to spare.  Several pockets for accessories.  It has a shoulder strap, handle, a belt loop so there are lots of options for wearing/carrying it.  This meets my needs perfectly.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not for Canon SX-40;Ordered this bag along with a new Canon SX-40 and was disappointed when I found that the bag was so small. When I tried to put my camera in the bag the on button was hit and the camera turned on. Not a good thing. I am returning this bag and ordering one made by Canon that Amazon sells. It looks better made and has more room. This bag would probably be fine for the smaller point and shoot cameras.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect accessory to accompany the Cyber shot;I bought this carrying case to go along with my cyber-shot DSC HX200V and it is a perfect additon that gives plenty of protection for the camera alleviating fears of dropping the camera and it holds the cords to charge the camera as well. There is not much room for other accessories in this bag but it meets my needs. I am definitely glad I purchased this case.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Handy camera bag;Convenient size.Gives a lot of room for the camera and gadgets. Good sturdy construction, the material seems to be able to stand up to a lot of wear and tear. The orange stripe is an excellent design feature.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Well Made !;Small, well made case that does the intended job. Fits my  nikon  coolplex l-120 Camera  with a little room to spare. Adjustable handle with velcro is a nice feature as is the dual connected zippers that open the case lid from the center out.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Very good quality!;It's a small bag for a long lens point and shoot. My camera (Nikon L120) fits perfect and it has more space for small items and  extra batteries. It has a shoulder strap, carry handle, a belt loop to wear as a fanny pack, several small pockets on the inside and outside. Material seems very sturdy and well stitched. A nice bag for a very low price!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;Nothing bad to say about this, it came in a package deal. It's convenient.
4.0 out of 5 stars;I DO recommend them.;Wee bit too large for my camera, but don't consider it the faultof this supplier.  I will make do.  Supplier shipped fast andproduct is new.  I DO recommend them.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Made well, but only big enough for casual camera;Very disappointed with this case. Its made great don't get me wrong! But definitely not big enough at all for my Pentax k50 with the kit lens like the reviews/answered questions say. This is for snap-shot camera ONLY (E.I. any camera that is not made with interchangeable lens and/or for personal use only). If you have a full DSLR with any sort of lens this bag will fit the body ONLY. Or lens ONLY. Will not fit both. Will be sending back immediately for credit towards another case. 2 stars because it really is well made, but did not fit camera at all and lens together which is what I was looking for.
4.0 out of 5 stars;A little smaller then I expected, BUT excellent product!;I thought the Camera Case was a little bigger, but I know sometimes we don't have the exactly notion of sizes. However the Case is very nice and I'm very happy with quality and proportion.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good fit for canon hs60 sx but tight with filter ...;Good fit for canon hs60 sx but tight with filter kit installed. Kept the case because it's good size.
4.0 out of 5 stars;recommend;This case is great for my little Cannon powershot camera that I got for christmas. Its just the slightest bit to big butthat leaves pleanty of room for more SD cards and lenses.
3.0 out of 5 stars;It's a nice product, however;It's a nice product, however, I returned it because it the camera, lenses and accessories wouldn't fit.  I tried to put my Canon A3000 in it, but it's a snug fit with just the accessories.  I bought a bigger case at Target and it fits better.  Be sure to buy a case that fits your camera and any other stuff you may want to bring with you.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good deal for the money.;Bought this for a Nikon L110. Lots of room for the camera to fit in. Two pockets on sides provide extra space for batteries etc.Seems to be well made. I think I paid around $9 at Amazon so I think that is a good deal.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good size for a small camera and its accessories.;I bought this to carry a small camcorder. It has external pockets and a padded divider in the inside compartment. There is a long strap to hang over your chest and keep secure. There's plenty of storage for extra SD cards and a spare batteries.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Did not fit my T3i =(;Ordered this case for my new Canon T3i. It is WAY smaller than I thought it would be. My camera does not fit with its lens on.In other words, if you are buying a case for a DSLR, this would probably be too small. Nevertheless, it looks like a decent case, has little side pockets you can put extra batteries and accessories, nice zippers, a bag handle and a removable strap. I will probably gift it to a friend.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not quite big enough;"This camera case was recommended with my 
Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX200V 18.2 MP Exmor R CMOS Digital Camera with 30x Optical Zoom and 3.0-inch LCD (Black) (2012 Model)
. The camera itself fits within the main compartment. However, the accessories are a tight squeeze in the side compartments. The USB cord I end up putting in the main compartment with the camera to get everything to fit in the case.This case could definitely use larger side compartments."
3.0 out of 5 stars;too tight for Canon T7i;I loved the built quality of the case. But this case is to tight to hold my Canon T7i. To push and pull the camera out of the case I have to struggle.
4.0 out of 5 stars;The right size of a Nikon Coolpix L840;I put my coolpix viewer side down to protect it and the straps fits nicely at the top around the capped lens. There a two side pockets for batteries, SD cards, and a small notebook.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Useful and convenient camera bag;Convenient and with useful side pockets, though the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ70 camera for which I purchased it fits somewhat too snugly inside with the top cover zipped.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Camera Case;I was a little disappointed in the actual size of the case. It could have been a little larger for the price paid. It is well made, was shipped on time, came well packaged and fit my needs for the most part.
4.0 out of 5 stars;struck out;I think it's great but the fellow I gave it to didn't like it...thought it was too big for the Coolpix S6800 camera I had given him.  I thought it would serve for other things, as well but...
3.0 out of 5 stars;Too small;This is a nice product but it is way too small for a high zoom camera.  Once you pack in an extra battery, the charger and a few memory cards, there is not enough room for the camera to fit well.  It is nice quality, but your camera needs to be smaller than what I have, a Canon sx40hs.  It would work well for a camera between a compact and what I have.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Camera Case is SMALL;The picture of the bag made it appear as thought it was big but in reality it is a small case.  It barely fit my Nikon L120 and that to only when I place the camera on it's side. There is no room anymore.  The cable fit in the side pouch though.The case appears to be well built. I guess I will keep it but I wish I had not paid $13 for it.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not as big as I expected;I bought this with my Nikon D3100 with the 18-55mm lens.  It protects my camera pretty well, but unfortunately it is pretty tight. I have to make the lens as small as possible to even zip the cover.  I was hoping to fit the battery charger in one of the side pockets, but it isn't even close to fitting. This would be a good case for a smaller camera that uses regular batteries, not the rechargeable ones.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Nice Bag But WAY TOO SMALL;I was considering sending this bag back because it is way too small.  I have to practically force my Canon Powershot SX50 HS into it.  It fits, but just barely.  And if I have to get it out of the bag in a hurry, forget it.  I will keep the bag and use it for my camera extras because it is a nice bag, but I will purchase another bag for my camera.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great!;Had it for a couple years and it is holding up and still working great.  I highly recommend.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works great;My husband got me a new camera for the holidays and I wanted a case to protect it. I looked for one at the stores around here and was not happy with the selection or prices. I went to Amazon and found this one for a price I could afford. When it arrived it was just what I wanted and holds everything perfectly.Susan
3.0 out of 5 stars;Bag is too small;The bag is too small for the camera I purchased.  This was a recommended purchase for this camera, but I don't feel it is large enough for the camera.  The camera barley fits the bag, and can't put anything else in the bag,  No fault of the bag, I just didn't purchase the bag I needed.  I could have returned this bag, but decided to keep it for a smaller camera that I have.
2.0 out of 5 stars;This was recommended for my Nikon P900 superzoom.  It doesn't fit.  Jeeze, Amazon.  Not cool.;I was looking for a protective case for my Nikon P900 super-zoom, and this was recommended by Amazon, by someone who never tried to cram the camera into this case.  When I tried to put the P900 in the case, it simply didn't fit.  I am reluctant to return it because it is a hassle for the amount of money I spent, so I am keeping it around in case I find some other equipment for which it more suitable.  But don't buy it for a fairly hefty super-zoom with a non-removable lens.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Tight fit with little storage;Guess I should have looked into this case a little better. I bought it for my Canon PowerShot SX50 HS and it's a super tight fit. The camera will only fit when it's turned sideways and there is no room for anything else. There's two small side pockets on the outside that are just big enough for a battery. The case does seem to be well made, but has a small cheap shoulder strap.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;Good brand, good product. Fits the superzoom compact camera I bought it for well.
4.0 out of 5 stars;I'm not negative...just honest!;"This case isn't as large as the ""professionally-positioned"" picture portrays but the low price should have been an indicator that it's not as ""spacious"" as I hoped for!  In the end:  it's adequate, but not exactly what I hoped for."
5.0 out of 5 stars;Looks great, works great;I use this for my Sony A5000 camera. Great fit for it and great protection. The design is also nice enough to not be embarrassed carrying around.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Snug for my Canon SS40;This is a snug fit for my new Canon SX40.  The lens cap comes off about half the time I am fitting the camera down into the bag.  I would probably buy it again because of the price.  But a little extra room would be nice.
2.0 out of 5 stars;I am sad to say I was disappointed in this item as ...;I am sad to say I was disappointed in this item as my camera will not fit in this bag. I have a Pentax K100 with the standard zoom lens and after inserting the camera in the case it can not be closed. I even took the lens off the camera and inserted it into the pouch and I had the same problem.The only saving grace is that I bought this used. I may just carry the camera in this bag and purchase another case for the lens.Luckily I have a larger case that allows me to carry the camera (intact) Cokin filters and spare batteries.Thanks you.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Will do the job for Lumix-FZ40;Overall a nice little bag. My fault for not checking the dimensions of the bag, since the picture shown, I believe to be totally deceptive. When I received it, I was surprised at the size, it appeared to be just a miniature version of the product shown. Not much room for anything other than the camera itself. It will do the trick for now, since I have yet to get any accessories. I can only suggest, checking the measurements before purchase.
5.0 out of 5 stars;LOVE, LOVE, LOVE;Best little camera bag for my Nikon Coolpix 610!  This is small, light, yet carries my camera, an extra battery both battery chargers, an extra sd card and still room for a bit more.  LOVE it!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good for starters;A little too small but for the price and somewhat-flexibility its a great carrying case
4.0 out of 5 stars;snug  case;I wish it was a tad bigger. My Canon camera is a very snug fit. It is a bit of a struggle to get it in and out of the case. But it is well made and I can live with it.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Very good product, robust case very pleased with it;"Very good product, robust case very pleased with it. Could you please add to ""free shipping"" in the advert  the words ""only in USA"". I live in New Zealand and the shipping cost was twice the cost of the case."
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not bad;"I purchased this for my Canon SX50 HS camera. I like that it has pockets for an extra battery & memory card. I can also fit a mini tripod in it which is pretty cool. The camera itself fits, but just barely. It's a snug fit especially with the protective filter on it. It does fit the needs. Would have been perfect if just a 1/4"" longer. Can't complain. The price was nice."
3.0 out of 5 stars;poor lay out;This case is very well made BUT not well thought out. Side pocket are a bit to small/ tite. I needed a battiey charger for 12V use. With charger in one side spare battey in other there is no room for AV cables. The case does have a belt loop But if on belt the zipper opens to your body not away from it making it hard to open and get camara out..
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect fit.;This case is a perfect fit for my Lumix G6.  It's a small, unobtrusive bag that will hold the camera, a lens, and some small accessories.  No frills, just something small and mobile.  I was able to give it to someone and have them store it in their moderately sized purse, which was also a plus when walking around.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Tight fitting;My camera fits well but the pockets are tiny and dont allow for much to put in them.  Like batteries and memory cards and link cable.
4.0 out of 5 stars;nice--but small;Really nice, but a bit on the small side.  My camera with lens fits in, but only barely.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect for my personal digital camera;Nice camera bag.  Plenty of storage space for additional items (like batteries or memory cards).  No complaints.I don't the model of my camera, but it's a personal sized digital camera.  No additional zoom lens or extra peripherals or anything, and it fits in this bag wonderfully.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Nice and compact;"Very nice, well padded carrying case for my new camera. Very ""compact"", I was not sure the camera would fit even though it was suggested to buy them together, but my camera does fit, nice and snug.nice handy side pockets with net pockets inside those."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works well.;Works great and holds my camera perfectly.  Several Poclets and places to store other items.  Spare batteries, Spare SD cards.
3.0 out of 5 stars;The camera fits perfect but it doesn't let you put inside the charger ...;It is smaller than i think. The camera fits perfect but it doesn't let you put inside the charger and car AC adapter. You can punt the camera some filters (abaout 3), two additional battery, a clean fiber and thats all. my camera is a Canon PowerShot SX60 Hs.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Okay.;I was expected little bit larger bag after watching the photo on amazon. But it was surprisingly small but I would not complain because it fitted with my camera. Price seems little bit high considering it's size.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good quality, but tight fit.;This is a nice little bag, but the key word here is little.  My Panaconic Lumix with 60X zoom fits, but barely.  It’s tight.  The saving feature is the outside pockets.  It will hold a charger and extra batteries, etc.  But I’m sending it back for something not quite so tight.  I also find the square shape awkward for carrying.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Eficiencia y funcionalidad;Excelente producto. Llegó muy a tiempo. Mi cámara Nikon Coolpix L300 quedó perfectamente cómoda. Muy contento.Gracias...!
4.0 out of 5 stars;It was the one that I need and looking for ...;It was the one that I need and looking for. It's small you can only have your camera in there
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice Little Bag;I have a Nikon Cool Pix 510 and it fits in like a glove.  The bag is compact and will be good for hiking.  It protects the camera well.  The side compartments could be larger to fit a charger. Overall it is well made.
3.0 out of 5 stars;A little to small;This is a nice bag just that it is to small for the Panasonic FZ-70 that it was sold as a combo item for. You can barely fit the camera and charger in it. There is not any room left over for accessories. It appears to be well made and I am going to keep it if I do not use it this camera I will use it for my others.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Snug Fit for a Canon EOS Rebel T3;It works to protect my camera (Canon EOS Rebel T3).  Its a bit of a snug fit, so I would have gone with a larger size so I'm not wrestling with it to get my camera out.
3.0 out of 5 stars;I got what I paid for;It is about the right size for my camera but one of the soft rubber zipper covers tore off after less than a week leaving me with a difficult to grab metal stub to open and close the case with. The tiny zippered compartment under the top flap is almost too small for my use. But it was only $12. I get what I pay for I guess.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Simple, small.;This works well for a simple camera. But I ended up replacing it, because it will not fit a camera with more than one lense.  The extra pockets are convenient for storage of batteries and memory cards.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good deal for the money.;Fits my panasonic lumix fz200 snugly. Inexpensive and pretty well made. Good for when you're taking just the camera. Will be getting another slightly larger case for traveling with the camera plus flash plus lens cleaning supplies.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Bag is a little small;Holds. A era and a few accessories. I really wish it was larger so I could carry all of my cool stuff with me. The case is compact though and very easy to carry around when hiking or trails
3.0 out of 5 stars;I wish it was a little bit bigger so it ...;I wish it was a little bit bigger so it could carry all my items without being too bulky. It almost fits my camera, the couple extra batteries, and extra sd cards. But I can't fit the charging pack for the batteries in this carrier with it.
3.0 out of 5 stars;It's a nice case, just not for this camera;This will not hold a Nikon coolpix P900. I ordered it as a suggested companion, and had to return it. I didn't check it without the camera strap, but I'm not taking off the strap every time I put it away. It's a nice case, just not for this camera.
2.0 out of 5 stars;decent looking case, way too big for most point and shoot and too small for DSLR..need better case-camera recommendation;Case arrived yesterday, while the bag appears sturdy and god looking..appears almost like a mini lunch bag when I compare with my Canon SX160IS size(you can stack 3-4 sx160s in this case) , this is way too big for most point and shoot..SX160 with its protruding lens is one of the big size point and shoot out there & this bag is too big even for that..so be very careful if you are planning to buy this for point and shoot...Also i tried for my NikonD40 DSLR, it won't fit..so really not sure what cameras are this bag meant for??I am giving 2* not for poor quality of the bag, but a very incorrect match i ended up with my camera/case combination. Amazon and the seller should give better description on what cameras these cases meant for.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good but not best fit;It is nice and compact, but it barely fits my Cannon DSLR--so snug that the strap doesn't fit inside the main compartment. I have to hang the strap outside the main area and zipper it into a side pocket. Otherwise, it will do the trick as far as protection of the LCD which was the main goal.
4.0 out of 5 stars;... using this for my OMD-10 MK-II and it is great. Only if it had separated inner pockets and ...;I'm using this for my OMD-10 MK-II and it is great. Only if it had separated inner pockets and may be some waterproofing for rainy days
5.0 out of 5 stars;perfect fit for my Nikon Coolpix L810;I was a bit worried my camera wouldn't fit in this case, but it fit perfectly. There is still room for several small accessories as well. The case is very well made, padded well, and several little compartments help to organize. I wanted a small bag, but big enough for protection for my camera and accessories, this case is perfect for that.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Tight fit at first for the canon sx50;We got the ever protect leather travel case first.  Was on pleased with that, so we bought this bag.  It holds the Canon sx50, once it gets stretched out and has plenty of space for extra batteries and sd cards.
4.0 out of 5 stars;It works well;This case holds my camera well. I chose this rating because it is bigger than I was expecting or needed, but it is made well.  It has several pockets to hold the cables/cords that came with my camera.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not I Expected;The bag's alright, and the price was reasonable.but not great. The stitching in some places feels unstable
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice bag;I love this bag! My camera (Nikon Point and Shoot) fits in it perfectly and it has plenty of compartments for accessories. Probably the nicest camera bag you will find for the price. I highly recommend it!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good fit for SX50 HS;Good solid case and good value for money - my Canon SX50 HS fits snugly inside and is well protected.  My only comment is on the strap which could benefit from some padding
5.0 out of 5 stars;Fits great;This case fit the camera great. I prefer sideways, I dont want to hurt the lens. to make it fit another way you have to put the camera lens now into the bag. I have a Canon Powershot SX50 HS. Glad I got this here, Best buy was over priced for this bag. I am glad I purchased it on here.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Bien;Esta bien
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;its a nice bag but to small for my camera so i sent it back
4.0 out of 5 stars;Compact, light and does the job;I got this case for a new Panasonic Lumix that I bought. The Case Logic stores everything that I need for that camera and is easy to take along. I don't have to worry about not having something important when i have my camera.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect fit for my Panasonic;This case fits everything I need when I travel.  I keep the instruction book, the charging cord, the camera, and extra camera cards, It is just what I needed and would recommend.
3.0 out of 5 stars;It's okay;I got this case because it was recommended by Amazon when I purchased the Nikon Coolpix P520.  It's okay.  It's a little snug for the camera but it will do for now.  I think I will eventually get a bigger case that can fit all of the cords, batteries, and additional SD cards as necessary, but it's okay as a starter case.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;Great I gave to my mom to put her Sony camera in it and it fit perfectly
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great price, does what it should;Holds our camera snugly and we couldn't ask for anything more. We don't store a lot of things (or anything) for the camera but there is room for at least another battery or two and a few memory cards.
4.0 out of 5 stars;great camera case for smaller cameras as well.;This was larger than I needed for my camera but was perfect for camera, cell phone and chargers. Well padded with padded separator. Good quality. Love the red stitching on black. Easy to distinguish on group trip.
4.0 out of 5 stars;... i used it one time and it is small like I want it;so far i used it one time and it is small like I want it, the camera fit nice and it have space (pockets) to have another items (SD card, batteries) in two pockets
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great!;Great bag! Roomie with side pockets. I just bought a new camera (still waiting for it to come) and wanted to protect it well.  It is sturdy with a sturdy strap to carry over the shoulder. The side pockets will fit extra batteries and a cleaning cloth no problem. Not bulky or awkward and such a wonderful price!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Protection is first...;It's one of my primary conditions when adquiro electronic products, and this bag complete with the features offered by the seller.However, I would suggest adding a couple of extra compartments inside, which obviously, bag should grow a little.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Opens up all the time;The zipper always unzips since I’ve bought and my camera has never fallen out despite long travels but still concerning!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Case Logic DCB-304;Good, but not great. Could be slightly larger, or another pocket or two. Received email one what appeared to be a better one, at relative price, but that was after the purchase. What's the point in that?
4.0 out of 5 stars;Case Logic DCB-304;The case is good. It has nice padding for protection but the case is not big enough as in the pics.. It hardly fits my Nikon coolpix P500 camera. Other than that the case is wonderful. Its not enough to carry my chargers and cables.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not big enough for a real camera;The bag is too small for a DSLR camera. It's only for small cameras, without lenses.I have a Nikon D3200 and it doesn't fit. Even if I take the lens out, there is not enought space in the side pockets to store the lens alone. It's a shame, because the bag is good quality, it's just that it's too small. Size does matter!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Lots of pockets for peripherals;Places for everything. cables, memory, spare batteries, charges, lens cleaners and Benedryl.It could be a tad larger for the Nikon P520, the fit is tight when stowing the camera with a tripod quick disconnect attached.
4.0 out of 5 stars;It was a little small from what I've seen but ...;It was a little small from what I've seen but it fit all the essentials that were needed, especially the camera! My dad loves it thanks!
4.0 out of 5 stars;would recommend this camera bag to anyone;received on time is as advertised , holds camera and misc. items with room to spare so will be ok, would recommend this camera  bag to anyone....  Ron P.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good for beginner/only one camera;From the pictures I expected this to fit more. It only fits the body of my Nikon D5200 with a basic lense attached. It's good for a beginner but once you start collecting lenses and flashes, you WILL need to get a new bag.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Well pleased;The case is fine. Not quite as well padded as some but perfectly adequate in this respect. I am well pleased with the item and supplier service
3.0 out of 5 stars;Will NOT Fit a Nikon Coolpix P900!;I was led to believe via amazon's recommendations that this case would fit a Nikon Coolpix p900. Yes, after much pushing an shoving it is theoretically possible to get the camera in, but this is NOT a proper case. Going with the more expensive Nikon case to make sure it fits next time.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;Nice complement for the Nikon L340 I gave my granddaughter
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good grab and go bag;Fits my Panasonic Lumix FZ200.  I put it in lens down.  Fits a couple of extra batteries, a filter or two, lens cloth and shutter release.  Good grab and go bag.
4.0 out of 5 stars;It does the job but needs to be more compact ...;It does the job but needs to be more compact. It becomes clumsy when in places you have to hold to a rail or tree when hiking
2.0 out of 5 stars;Ehhhhh;I needed a case for my Finepix HS25EXR and this is okay, because I didn't want to spend a ton of money, but if you want to hold anything else besides your camera, like batteries or cleaning equiptment, I'd suggest another bag. Once one or the other is in the bag it's a pain getting the other item in. And it's a tight squeeze for my camera. It protects it just fine because I had to brake and the bag went flying to the floor and my camera was fine. But its just for a camera only, not really much else will fit, so if you have a ton of stuff and don't want to bring another bag, I'd buy another one. If you just have the camera or a smaller camera than my it would be a good bag for you.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Not my size;Was to small for my point and shoot but was going on vacation so didn't return it
3.0 out of 5 stars;A decent supplemental camera case;I've seen better designed cases but for $10. I don't think it can be beat.  I'd prefer a top opening rather than having to click the flap and then access your camera.  By the time your camera is out of the case--the perfect shot could be gone.  Again, for the money--you'd have to go pretty far to find a better deal.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Zipper handle broke within two weeks;The case Logic case fits the Canon SX40 HS perfectly with room for the charger/cords should you need to carry them around with you. The main zipper handle broke off while I was on vacation. Used the camera on two short trips and the zipper broke. VERY disappointed. Now I have to dig my finger nail in to unzip it. Love the case otherwise but the zippers are flimsy. I am sooo gentle with the camera and case....it is very poorly made. I am not a big shopper on Amazon so maybe I should just return it? Maybe I got a bad one...who knows. The case is wonderful otherwise. I used it as a purse in Cabo san Lucas cause I took my camera out every night and didn't want to carry two things. My keys, money and lip gloss fit in fine!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great size for my Holga camera!;Perfect size for my Holga camera and all my accessories. I also unintentionally matched the bag  colors with my camera!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Tight fit with Panasonic FZ80;Tight fit on our new Panasonic FZ80 camera. Still a good value.
5.0 out of 5 stars;This is a great little case for my camera;This is a great little case for my camera. All the pockets allow for me to carry the computer cord, extra Flash Drive Cards, and an extra set of batteries with no problem at all, and the adjustable strap makes it easy to wear for trips where I am doing a lot of walking.
3.0 out of 5 stars;A bit too small for Nikon P900;Not quite large enough for a Nikon P900, otherwise feels like a good sturdy case. It works, but it's tight.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Just What I Needed;Simple, compact, and unobtrusive--just what I wanted. Good quality for the price, lightweight. with just enough room to cram in a few extras like batteries and the usb charger.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Just Right;Great little case for a 4/3rd's camera. It is well constructed and has some nice features like small SD card pockets.
3.0 out of 5 stars;TOO SMALL for the Canon Rebel t3i (t4i or t5i etc.);This is a great product, well made and sold at a good price but it is too small for the Canon Rebel t3i with the 18-35 stock lens. The camera fits but it's a very tight squeeze. It can still be used but it should be made clear that this product it is not intended for medium size DSLRs.
5.0 out of 5 stars;PERFECT for Panasonic Lumix DMC FZ35;At first I thought this would be too small for my new new Lumix FZ35 but the reviews said otherwise, so I gave it a try. It's deep enough to fit the lens and lens cap and it's got two side pockets where you could fit 2 extra batteries, memory cards, and other small things and a small pocket on the inside. Good deal. I definitely recommend.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great bag for the price;Brought this bag for my new FZ-200 Zoom camera. It is a nice bag with a good fit. The only thing I would change would be to add more padding. But for $12 what more could you ask for.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice compact bag with three external pockets and one internal;Nice compact bag with three external pockets and one internal.  Good fit for compact system if not carrying bulky accessories.  Well built, holds up under extended daily use with no wear.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Love this bag. It fits my s9400w camera perfectly with space for batteries.;Love this bag. It fits my s9400w camera perfectly with space for batteries. Also the side zip pockets are awesome. It's not a bulky bag thank goodness.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Could be a little larger.;This is a nice little case. However, that 's the problem: It is reallyy too small for anything other than the camera. It is well made and would work fine for cameras smaller than the N P510.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Case Logic DCB-304;The case is good and sturdy. However Amazon did not have variety of  cases to fit my camera. It seemed bulky for the size of camera I have. The material used is strong.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice case at a cheap price;Nice case at a cheap price. Side pockets are so small they are almost useless. A lot smaller than I thought it would be. Still a great value though.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Happy with Purchase;Happy with my purchase.  It was delivered quickly, but is a little smaller than expected.  However, all of my accessories and the camera itself fit in there, so this case is a good value for the price.
3.0 out of 5 stars;recommended with the Fujifilm FinePix S1 Digital Camera;Well-made bag.  recommended with the Fujifilm FinePix S1 Digital Camera.  Yes, the camera fits, but that's it!  Little room left for an extra battery or charger, cell phone, etc.  IF you're only taking the camera, it's perfect.  If you want to add other items, you will need a bigger bag!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Case Logic Reliability is a Calssic;Really reliable, well built, would be willing to pay more if it was waterproof, I can fit 2 lenses and my Nex-5 camera, including the 55-210mm lens and either a 18-55mm or my macro lens.
4.0 out of 5 stars;its a good case for my Nikon L830;my Nikon L830 fits in this case very nicely. It has good padding and a sufficient room for a extra set of batteries and a small table tripod. I would recommend it to anyone.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good product at a very good price!;Hold my camera and all of it's accessories in one case! Couldn't be happier!
3.0 out of 5 stars;A little too small;When I purchased this case, I expected to be able to put my camera and a couple of other things into it. Unfortunately, I can barely get my camera inside. If you plan to put additional things into this case, like your battery charger, lenses, etc., you should consider getting the next side up. I own a Canon PowerShot SX40.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Poor Construction;While I liked the storage capability of this case, I was extremely disappointed in the quality of its construction.  After a week of daily use, the straps holding the D rings came loose from the case and make it impossible to wear it with a neck strap.  In addition, the frayed ends that remained unraveled so badly that they kept getting caught in the zipper of the cover, making very awkward to open the case to retrieve the camera.  The case was also shipped without a neck strap so I had to use one that I had from another case.  I've had good luck with Case Logic products in the past, but lately this case and a couple of phone cases have proven to be less than well made.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good size camera case;Fits my Canon camera well and has places for the charger and extra battery
3.0 out of 5 stars;very small,;i bought this for my canon t4i. i should have read specs better but it looked plenty big in the picture but its tiny. if you have a small mirror less  or point and shoot than its a good bag but don't buuy for even a compact dslr. overall its actually a pretty nice little camera bag though
3.0 out of 5 stars;Fits for Panasonic DMC-FZ40;I bought DCB-304 for my new Panasonic FZ40 and its fits almost well: just for the camera, charger, cable and one or two memory cards (nothing else). The case is compact and easy to carry. There is not enought space so it could be very annoying if you need to use your camera frequuently. This is not a profesional but a funny and beatiful case.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Sturdy case VERY SMALL;Sturdy bag, however it’s very small. It will only fit a regular size DSLR and maybe a small lens. Picture is misleading.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect for my L820;I purchased the Case Logic DCB-303 for my Nikon Coolpix L820 and it was too small. Returned it and bought this one instead. It's the perfect size and the price was right, too! No regrets.
3.0 out of 5 stars;A little small;I have the Nikon D3100 and it fits but it all has to be assembled and it's a tight squeeze. I can't fit the battery charger or anything else in it. On the flip side, it is nice and compact and I can throw it a carry-on for plane rides and not have to worry about it counting as another bag.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great Camera Bag for the $$'s;"For the price, can't do much better.Room for charger, lens cleaning products, emergency (just in case) batteries, and the quick guide for my camera, so even I can figure out how to take ""beautiful pictures""."
3.0 out of 5 stars;Holds the camera ok but......;This is a nice compack camera case that the zoom camera fits into. But I like to have the charger and cord and the USB cord for hooking up to computer in the same case. It was very hard to get the charger and cords in the case with the camera. I would like the case to be just a little larger.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Too small for camera;This came bundled with the sony cyber-shot DSC-HX200V.  The camera barely fits in it especially if I have my tripod attachment piece attached to the bottom.  This makes it hard to get in and out quickly.  I do like the design, it is slimmer than others and not ask bulky when carrying so it doesn't bounce/sway as much
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice, simple, does the job;Purchased to go with my Nikon.  It fits snugly in place and the pockets are enough for charger and memory cards.  It is definitely worth the price you pay for it.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect for mirrorless camera;Perfect for the Canon m50 with the 15-45mm lens on
4.0 out of 5 stars;Very compact;This is a nice case. very sturdy. It will definitely keep your stuff safe, but it's super compact - they aren't kidding! Don't plan on cramming a lot of accessories in this one.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Camera case too small!;"This camera bag was listed as ""you may also be interested in"" when I purchased a DSLR.  One would expect that the camera bag would be well suited for use with the camera.  NOT SO!  The camera is a very tight fit with the smaller of the two lenses.  I would have expected that the camera body and both lenses fit into this camera case.  Be sure to check all of the specifications before making your purchase!  I will have to purchase an other camera case that is large enough to hold both of the lenses and camera body."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Camera case;This carring case comes in handy when I have my hands full.  I can throw the strap over my sholder and keep moving.  I recomend this product to all my friends.
3.0 out of 5 stars;is actually too small a case for my camera, ...;is actually too small a case for my camera, I don't think this will work and could not tell by the description before purchasing, guess will have to look some more.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect case for my Coolpix L840;Love this case for my Canon Coolpix L840.  Camera fits perfect.  Lots of room to store other items inside and in the zippered side pockets.  The padding is protective.Thumbs up purchase.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good Item;The item met my expectation let say by 80%. Apart the size which fit my Kodak Z990 and compared to the price, this is good item. But if you got charger then its not fit.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;Good
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;I like it but wish I went a little bigger for my camera.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Could be roomier;Got this for my Canon SX50 HS. It would be a perfect bag if it was just a little roomier.  My camera barely barely fits, with little room for strap, 2 extra batteries and an extra memory card.  Fortunately, I had another camera which fit better in this bag so I didn't have to deal with returning it.
4.0 out of 5 stars;GOOD BAG;CAMERA FITS WELL.  EASY TO REMOVE AND RE-INSERT.  COULD USE A LITTLE MORE PADDING I THINK.  STRAP COULD BE A LITTLE WIDER BUT IT'S NOT BAD.  EASY TO CARRY AS IS.
4.0 out of 5 stars;great for the price;The case come with a few pockets on the side, good for batteries and connecting cords.. good valuewould be nice in other colors,,everything come black today..  bard brown would look professioal..also.
3.0 out of 5 stars;too small for fz200 with the lens hood;This bag was offered as a package with the FZ200 camera.  Works well for just the camera but when the included lens hood is in place the bag is too small.  Had I known this I wouldn't have purchased this bag. Assumed that since it was listed with the camera, it would actually fit the camera.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not too roomy;Ordered this bag along with other camera items. the picture is kinda deceiving. I thought this bag was going to be bigger than the bag that came with the camera outfit. It's the same size. So you might want to buy a bigger camera bag if you want to carry extra batteries, charger media cards,etc.  M. Holmes
1.0 out of 5 stars;NOT for the Nikon P900;This was recommended for the Nikon Coolpix P900, so I bought it with the camera.  The case is cheap, and the build quality shows it. Worse, it doesn't quite fit the Nikon P900. Maybe for some smaller cameras it would be ok, but for the P900 it's too small. The cheap plastic zipper pulls apart from the stress when you try to close it. The case just isn't big enough for the camera.  Yes, the little zipper pockets on the side will hold extra SD cards and maybe a spare battery, but the case is literally coming apart at the seams when you try to close it with the P900 inside it. The people who recommended this bag for the P900 have clearly never tryied to actually fit the camera into one. Bad purchase.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Nice case;Case is way too small for what I needed.  I ended up returning it and ordering another.  It accommodated the Nikon camera body quite well but that was about all.  It was a quality product.  Wish it had been larger.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Does Its Job Just Fine;I got this to put my Canon SX40 in, and it fit nicely.  And then I decided to get a lot more accessories so I had to upgrade to something that held my tripod.  But, this is really well built and sturdy for the Canon SX40, or other similar Non DSLR models.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;Good product
2.0 out of 5 stars;Too small for Canon SX40 HS;By the time I put my camera in (Canon SX40 HS), I realized I bought the wrong product. I can 'just' fit the camera. So, for those occasions you need to quickly access the camera I found the case too glove like and taking too long to PULL the camera out. On top of that, the remaining space is too small for extra batteries and their required easy access.A nicely made camera case, but in my mind, the wrong case for my camera.By the time you pay the shipping and 15% restocking fee for the return, it is not worth the time for packaging and trip to the post office.
5.0 out of 5 stars;what a cool little bag;what a cool little bag. you can't really store more the the camera and the power supply and some SD cards but that's all you really need to take when you hit the road with your camera.the quality of the bag is better than expected for the money.
3.0 out of 5 stars;practical;I like all the little zippered compartments to put your extra things in it.  the strap adjusts well and can be worn like a belt.  However, the way the zipper is made, when I wear it like a belt, it is almost impossible to get the camera out.  A lot of time is wasted struggling with that.
3.0 out of 5 stars;TIGHT FIT if you want to add anything else other than a camera..;This is a tight fit if you want to add anything else other than a camera.I have a Nikon D3200 DSLR and it barely fit in this bag with the lens on the camera.Otherwise it's a good quality bag if you only want to fit the camera.
4.0 out of 5 stars;A compact case;The case is well padded. The camera barely fits into the case, and there is little room for accessories. Need a bit more room, but having said this, the case is easy to tote around.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Everything fits the camara and all the accessories that comes with the camara and much more.;This case works great with the camara and all the accessories.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Too small, not used;This was recommended with the Lumix so I didn't even check the size. I can barely fit the camera in the bag let alone the standard accessories I use.For a small camera, this is a nice sturdy little bag.I would NOT recommend this for a Lumix or similar sized camera unless your have very few accessories.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Case Logic DCB-304 Compact System/Hybrid Camera Case (Black);Case Logic DCB-304 Compact System/Hybrid Camera Case (Black) I use this for my other optical equipment I use when noble and SD cars and reader.. Worth the price.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Pretty Basic but works;This is a small case for cameras and fits the High Zoom cameras just fine. There's room for the camera, cables and batteries but not a whole lot else. Should be great for traveling light.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Top quality.;You can't go wrong with a Case Logic case. I have had a computer case from Case Logic for a number of years and now a camera case. Don't look anywhere else.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Bag for Fuji Finepis S8200;Amazon recommended this bag when I purchased my S8200 camera. It's a very nice bag, but is a bit small for the camera. Camera fits in but no room for extra batteries or the cables in case one needs them away from home. Bag is sturdy and well padded, just not quite the right bag for this camera.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good bag for the price;The camera bag appear to be well made and functional.  The only fault of the product is that it could be a bit roomier, enough to accommodate a charger and power corn
4.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect size;I had been looking for a bag for my 'bridge camera'. This is the perfect size.  I can get my keys in one of the side pockets, so it is the perfect size.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Love this case;Love this case, it's light and well padded.Still a little extra room with my Pentax X-5 (4.7 x 4.2 x 3.4 inches). It's perfect.Take good care of this product and it lasts long. I've had mine since 2014!
4.0 out of 5 stars;... is smaller than I wanted Otherwise it is a good case at a good price;Should have read the dimensions more closely as it is smaller than I wanted Otherwise it is a good case at a good price, and came right on time.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Nice case. Sturdy and enough space.;Perfect case for our camera. Well made and includes enough storage for everything we want to carry associated with the camera.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great quality! I only wish the strap was longer;Great quality!  I only wish the strap was longer, otherwise well made for the price.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Well designed but compact for the SX50 camera;It is very compact and works okay, but my other lost bag was just a bit larger letting my camera and lens shade fit inside...
5.0 out of 5 stars;Does the job!;"My Fujifilm digital camera fits nicely inside. small zip pouch inside. Two larger zip pouches on each side of the bag. Good padding to protect camera. Also has a carry handle, shoulder strap and a belt loop.  Well made. Good deal on this case. All I can say is ""Buy it"""
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;Does exactly what I expected in my purchase. It protects the camera as anticipated in a quality product.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Condensed;Great bag but small.  Much better than our old bag for the Minolta and the lenses and filters..  but getting used to it is just a bit small for the new Canon.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect size for my camera;Perfect size for my camera, lots of pockets to hold USB cable, charger, extra cards, etc.  I love that there are 3 different ways to carry this case too.  Nice and cushy for my camera.  Nothing bad about this product at all!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great case;This is a great little case.  It Fits my camera perfectly.  Just enough room, but if you are looking to carry a lot of extras, you may find this to small.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Muy comoda, buena compra;Me gusta mucho la mochila, es de muy buen tamaño y al tener varios comparimentos puedo guardar mis tarjetas e identificaciones y no necesito cargar mas cosas, mi camara cabe muy bien- Fue una buena compra
5.0 out of 5 stars;Easy to pack and carry;Nice lil carry back it gets the job done.
4.0 out of 5 stars;But it's a good Case.;Side pockets are not as deep as I thought they would be.  But it's a good Case.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Camera Case for Nikon Coolpix;This camera case is just what I wanted.  Holds the camera securely, a strap to hold over my shoulder, and a pocket inside to carry small items.  Exactly what I wanted and better price than I could find at my Wal-mart or Target.Fast delivery and came well packaged.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Average Camera Bag;This camera bag is much smaller than it is made out to be. The Nikon COOLPIX P510 is a relatively small camera with no removable lens, and it BARELY fits in this bag. There is minimal room for accessories other than a couple of small items. I would definitely choose a larger bag if I was buying another.
4.0 out of 5 stars;The good little one;This case has an excellent quality and simply has everything it offers, but it seems very small for my Coolpix P510. I will buy a larger one of the same brand.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not for me.;This bag is a tight fit for my Fuji SL1000 camera even though it was supposed to be compatible.  Once the camera is inside you can barely fit any accessories except for 2 extra batteries and cleansing cloths.  The bag is well made though and if I had a smaller camera it would work.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Excellent Case;Very well made camera case with lots of pockets and a sturdy shoulder strap. Only questions is whether it's large enough for all of the stuff you may want to carry.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Does a great job in storing the GPS and associated wires;Bought it not for a camera but for a Garmin GPS storage bag for my son. Does a great job in storing the GPS and associated wires, etc.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Nice case, but.,.......;Actually the case is quite nice but the camera does not fit very well.  Purchased for high zoom Kodak easy share Z990.  The camera and extras do  not fit very well and I will be unable to use the case.  Thought I would be able to pack the camera and the charger along with usb cable and mini-manual together.  (They all were able to fit in a small unpadded case that I had on hand. -  a little smaller than this case).  The case may very well fit several other zoom cameras and if all you wish to carry is the camera only then I can recommend and....If yours will fit you will likely enjoy the nice case.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Nice - Too Small;Case Logic will never let you down for quality and value.  Amazon also fits into this category.  I bought a new Panasonic Lumix DMC FZ200 camera from Amazon and the Case Logic DCB304 was recommended as the camera case to buy for my new camera.  While the bag is well designed and well built it is not large enough to fit my new Lumix DMC FZ200 camera, lens shade, transfer cable and charger inside.  I returned the case to Amazon and ordered from Amazon the Case Logic DCB-305, which is the next larger camera case in the Case Logic bag line.  It is compact, no wasted space, but all my new camera stuff fits much better.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Does the Job;The Canon SX40 does fit in the case, but I wish the case were slightly larger.  The two pockets help for carrying the charger and the cord.
4.0 out of 5 stars;I recommend it.;Fits perfect to my Canon Powershot SX50 HS, an additional battery and its charger.If you need a case for your SX50 HS, that is the product you are looking for.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;Wish it were just a tad bigger to get camera and one lens in.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice to use - Fits perfectly for my Camera;I ordered this one for my Panasonic FZ 40 and it fits well. Side pouch is handly to have the connectors and USB cable. And there is space for additional memory card as well.
2.0 out of 5 stars;What I didn't like was the fact that the bag was just too ...;What I didn't like was the fact that the bag was just too small to take my canon 7d n my sigma 17-50mm lens. I can't even put in any lens at all. the plan was for a bag that can contain one camera body, len and a speedlight at least. So my purpose of buying as been defeated. It's way too small to be used. I believe the image amazon used is confusing. It looks larger and bigger than it actually is.I deeply regret buying this bag. I suggest anyone needing a bag for a professional camera and lens should not buy this bag.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice bag;I purchased for a Nikon camera, however would not fit.  I used for a video camera instead.  I really like the bag, but I need a larger one.

5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect size!;I recently bought the Canon SX50 on Amazon and bought this bag to carry it in. It is the exact size I need with extra storage for a battery, charger, sd card and a microfiber lens cloth. I love the adjustable shoulder strap and that is compact and not big and bulky.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect for my Nikon L340;Perfect for my Nikon L340! Not too bulky which I was afraid of. I brought my camera and case to my sons tee ball game and I had enough storage for my phone and Chapstick lol
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good Case;I really like this camera bag. It has sufficient padding in it, but I would like it more if it was a tad bit more structured/sturdy.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works prefect for me;This camera case is just what I wanted a ton of room in it. I have two coolpix cameras in it and holds them both with tons of storage in it for everything I need
4.0 out of 5 stars;Wrong case but is a nice bag;Bought this along with Nikon p900. Nice little bag but really not for this camera.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice but small;Nice case but smaller than I expected so I ended up returning it.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Its ok but;It fits my Sony hx 200v but it doesn't allow for charging cords at all.  If all you need are some extra cards and a battery this is the perfect case for you.  But if you want the charging cords they just won't fit.  Perfect for day trips, not so great for vacationers.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Caselogic DCB-304 Hybrid system/ hybrid camera case;Let's see, I actally bought the wrong case for a camera i bought earlier.and returned because it was wrong for me. Then I just returned the camera case. Thanks, Randyh.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good value;Good, durable case.  However, it is small and doesn't have room for much more than the camera.  On the other hand, it's size makes it easy to carry.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;Great price, not as roomy at I would have thought, but holds camera and basic accessories.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Another piece of luggage to carry but good for camera;It is OK but bulky to carry around, this becomes another piece of luggage and a bit heavy for me to carry with my purse too.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great adition;Bought this for my 15 year old because we bough her a camera on Christmas. Great addition.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Nice Case But Not Right For Panasonic DMC-FZ40K;The minimum that a case recommended for this camera should accommodate is everything that comes with the camera in Panasonic's packaging.  There is no way that I can comfortably fit the lens hood into this case, let alone have any room for anything else that one might want to include, such as lens filters.  Other than that, the case is fine.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Case great fit for the camera;This case fits the camera perfectly.  There is room in the side pocket for the usb cable but not really room for the electric cord to recharge the camera.
3.0 out of 5 stars;It is NOT water proof;It rained the day I used it in my boat and the case leaked causing the camera to get wet.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;This is a Great little camera case....light weight, well designed.
5.0 out of 5 stars;but so far so good. The build quality is pretty good;This product hasn't gone through extreme situations yet, but so far so good. The build quality is pretty good, so there's that.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Didn't fit my camera with the lens on;While the camera case itself was nice quality, it was not large enough to fit my Nikon D5600 with the 18-300mm lens attached. I will have to return it.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good for your pocket camera and kit;This is not a large camera bag. it will not likely fit your DSLR.  It is good for carrying your pocket camera, charger, and a few other accessories for vacations and whatnot.  This bag is very well made and should stand up to the worst sort of abuse, from hiking or whatever.  RJB.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great deal;I bought to camera case for a fujifilm camera and it fits nice with a little room to spare. Has a side pocket and inside area for extra storage.

5.0 out of 5 stars;I love this case;I bought this for my new camera and it has enough space to carry my old point and shoot with my new camera. It also has space for both camera cords, extra batteries and the charger. The straps are comfortable and it came on time and in the condition expected.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;Smaller than I was expecting but it holds my camera (barely) but not much room for accessories.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Too small to hold battery charger;This case is nice but is a little small in that it is not big enough for the battery charger. I like the fact that it is smaller than the oversized cases, it just needs about two more inches of space or a larger outside pocket.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Fit my needs;This case fits my Canon Powershot 50hs with room in the side pockets for my battery charger, an extra memory card and id. It is also very light, but well-cushioned inside.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice case for the price.;It's big enough to hold the camera and extras but not overly bulky.  I bought this to go with the GEX500 Camera and it was the perfect size.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Wrong case for the job.;It's okay, but it should not have been displayed on the same page as the Fujifilm FinePix HS50EXR 16MP Digital Camera that I bought it to contain. That implied to me that the camera would actually fit in the case. It doesn't .
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice Bag;Well padded, small bag that is perfect for any non-reflex digital camera. Storage space for accessories is fairly limited, but still ample for any small camera that doesn't utilize multiple lenses.

3.0 out of 5 stars;Canon t2i w/ wide angle lense barely fit;My Canon t2i w/ wide angle lense & stabilizer barely fit in this case.

4.0 out of 5 stars;great quality and design;great quality and design. It is just kind a little for a camera with different lenses, but for a ultra compact camera is just fine.
3.0 out of 5 stars;It really is compact.;I ended up returning this product because it was too small. It would not fit a nikon d3200 with the lens still attached. Might be good for smaller dslrs, overall the quality was top notch, just not for me.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Excellent quality as usual on Case Logic products but my ...;Excellent quality as usual on Case Logic products but my Nikon D-5200 with standard 18-55mm lens didn't fit in it. Should have checked size twice.

3.0 out of 5 stars;Nice size but almost no padding;Fits my mirrorless camera nicely, but the padding is really thin.  I don't think it would provide much protection.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Case Logic DCB-304 Compact System/Hybrid Camera Case (Black);If youre reading this you should be clicking BUY!! It ia a Great Bag with all the Right sized pockets and Hidden storage compartments for Mem Cards and Accesories It was the perfect Buy For My Powershot Sx30 IS, it fit like a glove andhad space for more.

5.0 out of 5 stars;I like this small bag;I like this small bag. I'm using it for carrying a Sony a6000 with a 16-70mm lens. Usually all I want with me is a charger and a spare battery and this fits the bill perfectly.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not enough pockets;It's smaller than it looks and it needs more pockets. It was sold with my Nikon Coolpix L830 but there is barely room for the camera, much less paper, pens, spare batteries etc. Seems rugged enough and its easy to carry cross body.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice compact and well made.;Just a little snug. Would recommend one size larger if you are a regular photographer.  Otherwise great for traveling to keep everything together, camera, cards and batteries.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good quality;Made well, but a little small to carry extra things I need, like battery charger and extra battery. Will have to get an additional bag to carry my extras
3.0 out of 5 stars;Too small for high zoom point and shoot;This is a nice case, but just too small for a large zoom point and shoot camera (Lumix FZ60).  If all you want is for the camera and no extra stuff then ok.  If you want an extra battery, the charger, and maybe some lens cleaners then it is too small.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Small;Too small for more than just camera.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;Protects very well
3.0 out of 5 stars;It's a bit cramped.;It holds my Nikon D3200 with the lens attached but it seems a bit smushed. I wanted to be able to carry around my 2 extra batteries and the charger but I cannot fit everything in there. It does it's job but I just wish it was a little bigger.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good buy;I mean, what can you say?  It is inexpensive and it works.  Arrived when it should have.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Small but surprising;When it first arrived I thought it was too small, but it has ample pockets to hold accessories so it has worked quite well.  Great value and quality.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;The quality is good, but it doesn't protect much and it's small for my Nikon D3200
3.0 out of 5 stars;I have to replace these every year or so because ...;I have to replace these every year or so because the zipper wears out.  However, for the price, it's just right for a Panasonic Lumix FZ200, and even has space for spare battery and the charger.
4.0 out of 5 stars;OK;Case Logic DCB-304 High/Fixed Zoom Camera Case (Black), its very good item. Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?
5.0 out of 5 stars;Panasonic  FZ40 Camera;This is a great camera. The optical zoom of X24 is amazing. The speed burst for action shots is very good, 6 to 10 frames per second. The resolution is fantastic (14.1 megapixels). It took me awhile to figure out setting the flash, but all's well the ends well. I would highly recommend this camera.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Tiny;Fits my tiny camera well although I was expecting a bigger case this case was tiny I should have listened to other reviews but since the quality was there 5 stars
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;Nice bag! Serves its purpose very well

4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;Fits the Nikon Coolpix L340 perfectly
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good Buy but Small;Smaller than I thought so I couldn't use it for what I bought it for but it is durable so I gave it to my mother for her small video camera.
3.0 out of 5 stars;A little too small.;A little too small for my Canon SX40 HS 12.1MP Digital Camera.  Doesn't give me room for my rechargeable battery and the associated cords.  I feel I made the wrong choice.  I read, here on Amazon, that it was a good choice for this camera.  I disagree.
4.0 out of 5 stars;it fits my Panasonic lumix 60x optical zoom camera.;This case fits my Panasonic lumix 60x optical zoom camera.  Would recommend buying. It's a perfect size for taking on vacation or outdoor activities.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Go for it!! Recommended;First of all, the material of the case is excellent. Has lots of pockets inside and outside. Fits most of the cameras without a problem. Easy to carry. The handle is also very strong and reliable. Highly recommended.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Quality and Price/Size is ok;I like the quality of the bag and also the price. The size, basing on the picture I thougth it was a little bigger and got dissappointed when openned the mail box. A Lumix FZ200 fits well, but if you want to carry the charger also, they donot fit well.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Serves Purpose;The bag is functional and suites my needs to store my many equipment pieces, would like for it to be a little deeper or more compartments.

4.0 out of 5 stars;very good price/quality relation;Very good price/quality relation. Not the best one available, but if you do not plan to go hard on you camera, this works great.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Very good case for Fuji HS20;The case was perfect size for the Fuji HS20 superzoom camera that I bought.Nothing to complain about qualitywise and appears quite sturdy and well manufactured.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;I love this camera case. It fits my camera perfectly, and the added compartment space is a bonus!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Five Stars;Perfect little case for my needs.  Plenty of cushioning and pockets for extras.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Camera Case;The picture in the ad is deceiving.  It looks like a much bigger case than it really is.  I bought it to store tapes, microphones, etc. for my camcorders but when I received it, it was a very small case that would fit just a small digital pocket camera.  It may have been my fault as I didn't really check out the dimensions (although I don't remember if they were listed) I just went by the look of the case in the ad.  It is probably a very nice case if you are looking for a very small case for your small digital camera.

4.0 out of 5 stars;Camera case;Case is well made.  Great mailing to have It arrive in time for Christmas. Packing was good so it arrived in good shape.
4.0 out of 5 stars;I like it;It is useful, perfect for my camera and all the accessories and also I considered pretty and comfortable, I like it
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not enough storage space for my CANON Camera and it's supplies. Camera barely as it is.;Not big enough and not enough storage space.
4.0 out of 5 stars;does its job well;this case performs its functions well, not so water proof, but does repel water drops, like rain or sprinklers! enjoy!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great!;I really like the camera bag. The camera fits in it snug to keep it safe and sound. Extra pockets for accessories.
3.0 out of 5 stars;looked bigger in picture;smaller than I thought
4.0 out of 5 stars;It is pretty small but useful.;It is okay for my Canon T3i but i would like it to be bigger. Nothing to say about quality.
4.0 out of 5 stars;PERFECTO;CABE TODO ASI NO TENGO QUE ESTAR LLEVANDO MAS COSAS Y LA CALIDAD Y EL COLOR SE VEN BUENAS Y RESISTENTES GRACIAS
3.0 out of 5 stars;Suitable for camera only;This case was recommended for our Canon SX40. It fit the camera but there was very little room for extra lenses, batteries, battery chargers, etc. If you only need protection for your camera it's a great case. To accommodate other equipment you need a larger case.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great buy!;I bought this for my Dad and it was perfect for his needs. It is compact enough to be convenient but holds everything that he needs for a day out at a function or in nature. He likes it very much.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;nice size bag for my daughter camera, fast shipping
1.0 out of 5 stars;Too Small for Panasonic Lumix FX70;While the product does appear to be of above average quality, if you buy this with the Panasonic Lumix FZ70, you will not be able to use it, because your camera will not fit.  Putting your FZ70 in this bag is like putting rubber gloves on wet hands, and just as bad taking it out.  Not to mention, there is absolutely no room for the accessories.  Case Logic is and OK brand, but this is being returned because it is of no use for my camera.  This 1-star rating is due to the false marketing claim that the case is for the Panasonic Lumix FZ70.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice bag;Nice bag. Good support for the camera. Seems to be well constructed and of quality.
4.0 out of 5 stars;good choice;just buy it and use .. good choice for camera bag.. i recommend this product... cheap and good value !!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Nice Case !;Have been keeping it in my backpack when traveling but sometimes it gets abused. With my Panasonic FZ47 in this case I feel very secure when traveling and the case is large enough for spare batteries and accessories, Very Happy.

3.0 out of 5 stars;My camera barely fits so all I can take is ...;My camera barely fits so all I can take is a spare battery & extra cards. The charger or card reader doesn't fit.It is really for an even smaller camera than the canon powershot I got.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Measurements listed are wrong;Bags internal dimensions are just plain wrong. Idk what kind of high zoom this bag is designed for but it won't fit my tamron 28-75 and that lens is on the smaller side for a full frame zoom. Waste of money.

4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;it's nice and helpful case 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
3.0 out of 5 stars;To small to be very useful;A bit too compact for my liking. The camera body and kit lens of my nikon d5200 barely fit by themselves. Does the job but barely. I've already bought a proper camera bag. Still it is cheap for what it does.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great product;It is the perfect size and price point! I use this for my lenses at every shoot, and every wedding.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Case Logic DCB-304 Compact System/Hybrid Camera Case (Black);Overall this is just an OK camera bag. My Sony Cyber-shot DSC-WX50 is sliding around inside it, and the outer pockets barely hold the charger and accessories... They need to make the pockets a little larger and the camera compartment a little smaller... IMO
4.0 out of 5 stars;The product is very good;The product is very good .. It was as expected .. Recommend to the acquisition of this product ..Thank you
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;Works fine. Like every says, snug fit with camera and charger. But works fine.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;Case was a little small for the Nikon camera that we purchased with it.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;too small
5.0 out of 5 stars;Ideal and practical;"I bought this case because it was offered for my camera (canon sx510 hs) and I see why, it fits perfectly and the pockets are very ideal for extra batteries, charger, usb cable and even a 5"" tripod."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Does the job;Nothing fancy, but a worthwhile buy to protect a new camera
2.0 out of 5 stars;Too small for my Coolpix P900;Bought this because it was in a bundle that went along with my Coolpix P900 I recently purchased. Not sure why they put this in the bundle in the first place since the camera literally wouldn't even fit in the case. Sent it back and purchased the  Evecase Compact DSLR / SLR Micro four Thirds Digital Camera Holster Carrying Bag Case - Gray Small Canvas instead and love it.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect fit!;I'm puzzled by comments that a Canon SX40 doesn't fit, or fits too snugly.  It goes in easily and removes easily, with room for extra batteries, cards, filter.  It looks to be well made, and so much less expensive than options.
4.0 out of 5 stars;but its still a good case.;It is a little smaller than I expected, but its still a good case.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Case picture is deceiving.;The picture is deceiving.  It's a small case and my camera just fits - can't put anything extra in it.  My camera is a Fujifilm sl300.  Would be a great case for a smaller point and shoot camera.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Fits my Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ200. The only issue I ...;Fits my Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ200. The only issue I have is there is no place to put the sun guard accessory, so I have to carry that separately.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good for transport or storage.;Nicely padded, camera and accessories each have a place. Small zipper areas for additional memory cards and batteries. Camera area roomy enough to fit camera and strap. I do wish there was a wide enough area to store manual and discs.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great Case;I bought this case for my point and shoot because of it smaller size.  With the pocket storage on each size I can store everything I will need AND the charger for my batteries when I travel.  Great product.
3.0 out of 5 stars;A bit smaller than I expected;It was just a bit smaller than I was hoping. It has room for a 15-45mm lens and the body of a Nikon D3200 but its a tight fit. Just wish It was a little bit bigger. Beside that its great
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;A little smaller than I expected..
5.0 out of 5 stars;This is great, holds my new camera and extra batteries;This is great, holds my new camera  and extra batteries, and my cards. Protects my camera. nice and small. Strap is sturdy.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good;This case is convenient and holds all my camera essentials. The camera fits snugly and does not bounce around as I move
3.0 out of 5 stars;Case Logic DCB-304;OK, but bulky and hard to fit in a backpack, etc. Would have preferred something more streamlined with thinner padding.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great camera case;I really enjoy the smaller size of this camera case. The case holds everything I need and isn't too bulky.
4.0 out of 5 stars;camera bag;Item arrived near anticipated date.  Although it was smaller than I anticipated, it works well and has the appearance of quality manufacturing.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Case Logicc DCB-304 Camera Case;Bought this for the new Sony Camera I purchased.  Was so pleased it was a good size for camera and accessories.  Not too big and not too small just right!!Well made and would certainly purchase another one if needed.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;Worked as advertised!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;Very nice case
5.0 out of 5 stars;Small yet holds a lot;Works great for a Sony A6000. The perfect size for the camera and the side pockets work good for memory cards and batteries
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect fit for Nikon P6000;perfect size and very light, will love it on upcoming vacation.  My Nikon P600 is perfect size in this bag with room for extra batteries and cards.  Thank you.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Works great but failed quickly;This case was the best fit I could find for my Canon SX50 HS bridge camera, but after 2 months I noticed that one of the nylon straps that attaches a D-ring to the case was nearly ripped clear through.  Fortunately I noticed it while it was not suspended from that D-ring and the case and camera didn't go careening down a hill or something.  I'm past the Amazon.com return window, so I'm going to have to go through the Case Logic warranty process, I guess.
3.0 out of 5 stars;It's ok;It's ok. I just missed information about de dimensions of the case. Before got it I was afraid if would be possible to use it with the camera and others accessories, but it's ok. Could be a little larger but is ok.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Small but good.;It's a lot smaller than it looks in the picture. Our camera barely squeezes in there and makes it too tight to fit anything in the side pockets. It looks good and is sturdy so we kept it anyways.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Three Stars;nice but only space for camera, not for accessories or if your planning on carrying anything else in it
3.0 out of 5 stars;didn't like the camera we got it;its okay as a case ... didn't like the camera we got it for

4.0 out of 5 stars;but otherwise great for on-the-go;It was a little smaller than I'd envisioned, but otherwise great for on-the-go!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Nice case!;Good case to go along with the Nikon Coolpix P600.  Everything fits in there and the fact that it has a belt loop on it makes it attractive to me as well.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Just the right size.;Nice little bag for a point-and-shoot with some extra gadgetry.  I've got an RX100 M3 with attached mini tripod and strap in mine and there's room for a spare battery and charger, too.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good product!;Good quality and the perfect size for my Canon SX60HS and a few accessories.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;nice
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not mujch space for accessories;I expected it to be bigger. It was listed as compatible with my canon sx60 which barely fits and doesn't leave space for much else... eg filters, batteries, lenses
2.0 out of 5 stars;so I believe their company's products and the results make me very disappointed because i simply can not put my nikon camera ...;I just saw the seller's feedback, I thought carefully I should also have to pay some responsibility, because I did not read the product description, I read once but the product description is still a little vague, if this camera bag with SLR Can not fit, how can be called SLR camera bag it?
3.0 out of 5 stars;Like It but too Small;It is way smaller than i expected! I got it cos i wanted to use with my Nikon D3200. The bag cant contain the camera with the lens talkless of other accessories. Else it would have been a great case/bag.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Camera bag is too small!;This was the case recommended on the Amazon website but it was way to small for my FinePix HS50EXR, so I returned it and purchased a Navitech SLR Camera Bag instead.  I hope that one is big enough.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Too small;So small my camera didn't fit. Even with a smaller camera, there is very, very little room for extras, like batteries.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Handy Camera Bag;Thebag  has plenty of room for the camera and many pockets for all the accessories. It is what I wanted.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;fit my camera perfectly
3.0 out of 5 stars;Too Small;This camera Case indicates it is for the DSC camera, but it is a lot smaller than it looks or the measurements would indicate.  There is barely room for the camera and an extra battery.  I was very disappointed.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great product.;Holds the camera and accessories in style.  Very useful.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great price and high quaility!;I really was surprised at how nice this was considering the affordable price. It holds my new camera and all the extras I need. I would recommend this for anyone looking for a great deal!

4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;A LITTLE PRICY FOR THE CASE
5.0 out of 5 stars;A must have camera bag!;Great protection and storage bag for my Nikon Coolpix camera. Definitely recommended for trips and travel. It has enough space for extras too!
1.0 out of 5 stars;This case does not fit the camera;Bought this case as a bundles deal.  Was supposed to fit the camera.  It doesn't.  I can't imagine who thought this case would fit my Canon SX-50. I had to trim some of the padding out of the inside just to get it in the case at all.  And you can only put the camera in sideways!  And even then it's a tight fit.  Canon makes a case for the SX series that is perfect.  Which I have ordered, and now I have a camera case that's useless.  Can't even fit my older, much smaller camera in it!  A waste of money, at least for the Canon SX series.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice compact case;Canon SX40HS fits snugly, also holds extra batteries, memory cards, cables and battery charger. Nice appearance, rugged material and zipper.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect case;Perfect case to suit my Coolpix P250. Easy to carry, with good storage pockets for cables and battery charger.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;Good
4.0 out of 5 stars;The perfect case;The Cyber-shot DSC-HX200V camera fits well and provides ample space for extra battery, cleaning cloth, Memory cards and connecting cables.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good Addition;If you are going to put in the dollars for a camera, get a good case.  This case is very roomy and protects the camera.  You can also carry some attachments.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;Fit my camera perfect and the side pockets are great
3.0 out of 5 stars;This little case does not fit the Canon Powershot camera ...;This little case does not fit the Canon Powershot camera it was sold with.  It's not molded to the camera's shape at all, just a generic little padded bag.  It seems well made, though.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Tight Fit;The case was high quality material and well made. Unfortunately it is quite a tight fit. I took one of the other reviewer's advice and also purchased a handstrap to help pull the camera out of the case. The strap actually exacerbate the situation, and I could barely zip it closed.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Very happy with my purchase;Fits my Nikon Coolpix P530 perfectly and should fit all similar cameras. It's attractive looking and feels very well made. Very happy with my purchase, especially for the price.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Ideal camera bag;Fits my Canon Powershot SX510 perfectly. Feels secure and is lightweight.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;great for a small DSLR or large point and shoot.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Three Stars;A bit small for all the camera bits and pieces.
3.0 out of 5 stars;It works...;I bought this because it was shown as a compatible case for my Fuji FinePix SL1000. The case is nice...doesn't feel cheap, but the fit is very snug. As I like to travel light, it works for me.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;Very useful and durable. Worked perfectly for what I bought it.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not quite what I hoped for...;I've only had it for a few months, and the edges are fraying! It does it's job, but it's very small. If your camera lens is bigger than 2 inches or so, it will not fit.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Case too tight for the camera for which it was recommended.;"I bought this case along with a Fujifilm FinePix HS50EXR, because of the camera page notation saying ""Frequently bought together"".  The case is not large enough to fit the HS50EXR without a struggle to get the camera in and out of it.  I will probably keep the case since it was relatively inexpensive and I can force the camera into it, but I post this as a heads up for future HS50EXR buyers."
2.0 out of 5 stars;Good quality bag, but REALLY small!;The picture actually makes it look bigger than it is. This bag can barely fit my NIKON D3300 (which is a small dslr)I'm not sure why this one looks huge and is at the top of the list when you search dslr bag. cannot fit a bigger dslr. Cannot put any more lenses except kit lens. Not happy with this.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good fit for a micro four third;Fits my Panasonic G6 with 14-42 kit lens and assorted camera gear.
3.0 out of 5 stars;not bad for after market;Nice case. however I would prefer to have a bag specifically for the Nikon purchased. For an after market bag I would recommend if don't want to buy name brand camera case. Keeping bag for sure.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Three Stars;Good for a smaller digital camera but didn't take into account there was no room for a lens.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Way too small;This bag is way to small for my Canon Rebel T3. The pockets on the side dont fit much and my camera fits inside but very tight. It needs more protection and cushion for the camera. Other than that its a good bag for the price.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Not bad.;Small and decent. Not bad.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Too small for my needs;The case is constructed well, price is very reasonable, but I gave it three stars due to the size.  With my camera in the bag there wasn't much room for anything else.  I ended up returning it.
3.0 out of 5 stars;I like the quality but;I like the quality but, although this bag was recommended for my camera and it has lots of pocket, I can only use few pockets, otherwise the camera won't fit.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great bag for the Nikon CoolPix P510;For my purpose, it is a great bag. It is perfect if all you want to carry is your camera. My camera, the Nikon CoolPix P510, fits perfectly along with the wall charger and extra SD cards.
5.0 out of 5 stars;ZIPPER BAG FOR CAMERA;It's a bag that holds a camera. What more can I ask?

5.0 out of 5 stars;Five Stars;Love it! My Sony A6000 fit like a glove! Excellent quality and pricing.

5.0 out of 5 stars;Five Stars;I purcharse it for my Nikon D3400, it fits perfectly.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Quite difficult to keep and take out the camera;May be I have not noticed the size (dimensions) properly, it is slightly difficult to keep in and take out my Canon SX30IS camera. I feel the bag would have been slightly bigger in size as it would have been easier to keep  in and take out.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good bag;Great bag. Was a lot smaller than expected. My t3i fits in it but it has to be pressed in with the lens facing up. Really tight fit but still a good bag
3.0 out of 5 stars;Too small for Canon 70D;Despite what reviews and speculations say, this is too small for my Canon 70D. Very tight fit and uncomfortable to insert and remove. I suggest something a step larger.

4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;Very convenient camera case.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not a good case for my lumix z80;My Lumix z80 takes up every inch of space on this case. It is so tight that the extra room in the main pocket and the two side pockets are rendered not very useful. Id like to see just a little more room in order to give this more than 2 stars. It does seem like it would be a good case for a smaller camera.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good;Excellent
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;I like it
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;Great price. Couldn't be more happy...
3.0 out of 5 stars;Really. Small.;Overestimated the size of this bag. Does not fit my canon t2i. Should have read into the dimensions more. But it'll do, just wish it was a tad bigger.

I literally need to squeeze/jam to get it in the bag.  This is part of the description ""Camera Bag Compatible with Most Compact System, Hybrid and High Zoom Cameras""  Unfortunately that is not the case, no pun intended."
3.0 out of 5 stars;Bag looks fine, but not for a DSLR camera;Bought it because it was recomended when i boimight a Nikon D3200 and it dosent fit properly. Bag looks fine, but not for a DSLR camera.
3.0 out of 5 stars;It's a great camera case;It's a great camera case, but maybe not for a DSLR with a large lens. Unable to hold additional lenses. This case would probably be better for a smaller compact camera.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Very Good Case.;Purchased as Gift -  Stated it was great.

4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;Too little but it works for the camera.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Case Logic camera bag;Bought this as a package deal with my camera. A bit too small for anything more than the camera & batteries, Well made. Looks very nice and nice shoulder strap that does not slip off your shoulder.
2.0 out of 5 stars;"You better have a REALLY small camera for this case to ""work"" !!!";This is very well made, but provides VERY little room.  I have a Panasonic Lumix DMC-300, and although it will go in there, it is extremely tight.  Absolutely no room for the lens hood, battery charger, spare battery.....NOTHING !  Take my advice, purchase something larger !
3.0 out of 5 stars;Three Stars;It is a bit small for all the stuff you need to pack for a trip.

5.0 out of 5 stars;Realistically large case for camera and supporting accessories!;This is a very high quality case with numerous pockets and compartments for organizing the camera and its accessories.  My first Case Logic that won't be my last!  Very rugged for a soft case!
3.0 out of 5 stars;wyo kid;After using this camera bag several times I was disappointed with the quality of the bag and the protection I want while packing my camera on the trail. I have purchased a LowPro bag which is better constructed with additional padding.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Oversize for the Canon PowerShot;This bag is big enough to fit 2 Canon PowerShot cameras. I returned it. Otherwise, quality is fine. It is just not the right bag for a medium size point and shoot camera.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;Good and well priced.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;This is a sturdy and reliable product.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;Great bag.
5.0 out of 5 stars;High quality Camera bag;High quality Camera bag with great protective padding, light weight, ample storage & durable contraction. Easy access zippered side pockets for battery & memory storage. I would highly recommend this product and the seller.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Too small;I ordered this at the same time I ordered a new camera. It looked like a nice big bag compared to the camera it was pictured next to. I purchased a Fujifilm HS50EXR and it does not fit in this bag. It states that it is for a high zoom camera and even came up as being recommended to purchase with this camera.  Pay attention to the measurements because it is much smaller than it appears.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Lots of Room!!;I was very glad i got this bag. It fits everything from the camera to all my lenses and the charger. Love this bag
3.0 out of 5 stars;Nice compact case;The case is compact and a little tight for this camera, you cannot carry the battery charger etc in this smaller case, if you travel I recommend a larger case for the accessories you need to take with you
4.0 out of 5 stars;For cameras on the go!;Compact, but everything fits nicely into it.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;Nice bag! Love all the pockets

4.0 out of 5 stars;Returned;Returned with Camera
3.0 out of 5 stars;Returned only because it was too small for my needs.;Very high typical Case Logic quality, but unfortunately it was too small for my needs, so I had to return it.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Should have been big enough to accommodate the camera lens;This is a nice compact case, that was recommended in the Amazon Site after I bought the Canon Rebel XTi DSLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 Lens (OLD MODEL). To my disappointment this case can only fit the camera minus the lens, which makes it useless for my purposes. I hope that the manufacturer can correctly recommend the appropriate size of cameras that can fit into it.
3.0 out of 5 stars;a little small;can fit my camera in here but not the battery charger as well
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;Good Product
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect for my GoPro;I use this to carry all of my GoPro accessories and camera when I am on the mountain.  It is smaller than you think, but it gets the job done.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;compact size will do the job.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Nice product;I was pleased with the quality of the product given the low price.  Unfortunately, it was too small for my small Sony A3000 SLR camera. I had to purchase another case.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;It works great.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great bag, great price!;Fits my camera wonderfully!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Do not get for Nikon P900;This was recommended along with the Nikon P900 camera. However, the bag is too small. Seems like a decent enough bag though.

3.0 out of 5 stars;Small but okay.;Too small for my Nikon DSLR, otherwise it has good construction and adequately padded inside.

5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect for Panasonic Lulumix dmc-fz150;I bought this case for my brand new panasonic Lumic dmc fz150 and it fits great and is perfect for the size. It is thick and does a great deal of protection to the cam. Worth the money!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great little bag;Bought this camera to store a Panasonic superzoom camera that I purchased for my father.  It is sleek, compact and fits all the stuff that I needed to store.  Lots of useful pockets.  Good quality material.
3.0 out of 5 stars;It will work;It fits the camera but doesn't cradle it well  enough to protect it from a serious (+4ft.) drop.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Just what I wanted.;It is a very sturdy case. holding my camera very well, with lots of space for batteries, charger, cords for downloading, etc.  I am very pleased with the look and feel of this case.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Durable but small!;I bought this for my canon Mark iii and it didn't fit. The description said it would unless I read that wrong.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great Camera Case;This case is just the right fit for my camera, a Samsung WB100. Seems to be made quite well, high quality. The storage pouches on it really come in handy. Definitely recommend.
3.0 out of 5 stars;tight fit for SLR!;i ordered this to go with the Panasonic Lumix G1 camera for my husband.  The camera with the lens is a very tight fit.  Cant' put much of anything else in the case with the camera assembly! However, it is a well made, sturdy product!

2.0 out of 5 stars;Deceptive photo of useless bag;This was a waste of money.  I was buying this as a gift so the person could carry the camera and lens I was buying together.  They need separate carriers because there isn't room for both even though bag is made to appear to have multiple compartments unless you plan on only putting one lens paper in each one you cannot place more than just camera in bag
5.0 out of 5 stars;nice;I read a few reviews. This case meets my ex[pectations, it is copact and has room for my camera and charger.I had it for a few months and so far am happy
4.0 out of 5 stars;Adequate;Very good for my Fujifilm S8200

2.0 out of 5 stars;The camera case is nicely made and was suggested on Amazon as a good ...;The camera case is nicely made and was suggested on Amazon as a good companion purchase with the Fujifilm FindPics camera I purchased. The problem with the case is it is too small for the camera. You can force the camera into the case but it is a very tight fit.
1.0 out of 5 stars;I regret I bought this;"Too small to be useful except for a cheap ""point-and-shoot"" camera that you wouldn't want a case for anyway. It was one of those ""up-sells"" Amazon offers when you buy a camera. It looks much bigger in the picture than it really is. I love the camera I bought, but I regret I bought this along with it.Best bet: Go to a camera store (remember them?) or to Walmart with your camera an all your accessories, and buy one that accommodates your needs. This is not something you want to buy as an up-sell."
3.0 out of 5 stars;Well made but be careful of needed dimensions;Case is well constructed but the dimensions listed were external, not internal.  I had to buy another bag for my camera though I can use this one for excessories
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;good
3.0 out of 5 stars;Three Stars;This case is smaller than I thought it was, wish it had been a little larger, but is ok.
3.0 out of 5 stars;A little small.;It's a little too compact for the Lumix FX100 basic camera, and replacement battery. I need a larger case but the case is built great.

1.0 out of 5 stars;Too Small and Inadequate for My Camera.;This camera case was recommended by Amazon to house the Nikon P900 camera.  So I thought I was safe in purchasing it sight unseen.Wrong!Shame on you Amazon for recommending a camera case that is far too small for the camera!!The P900 does not even fit in the camera case.  Argh!!!!I'm returning the case as it is made instead for a small compact camera, not a DSLR camera.Bottom line:  don't buy this case for the P900 Nikon!Kone
3.0 out of 5 stars;Three Stars;Works well, doesn't fit my Nikon p600 with the extras very well, it's a very tight squeeze
5.0 out of 5 stars;Excellent!;I am using this case for my Kodak Max Z990.  Perfect size.  I can also put in 4 AA batteries extra and my Cybershot TX-10 for underwater pictures.  I highly recommend this case.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Three Stars;It's a compact case great for small cameras. Not for DSLR or if you have additional lenses.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Needs more padding;I realize it is a compact case but it could use more padding. It's better for keeping things together but not protection.
5.0 out of 5 stars;A carrying case for my new camera.;I recently bought a Sony H200 digital camera. This case is a very good fit for the camera and hasside pockets for spare batteries, SD cards and lens accessories.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Don't be deceived by the title;This case is good only for handy cams. I bought this for my Canon T3i as the title and pictures said high/fixed camera lens.I am struggling now to fit my camera in and out every time I take it out.It's been long time since I bought this case, but thought of providing this review that might help others.Quality of the case is very good. Not recommended for SLR's
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;4*
3.0 out of 5 stars;Needs a longer strap;The strap is too short for me to wear across my body, so it pops out at an awkard angle at my chest.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great Case;The camera fit in the case perfectly, There are lots of little places to store things, and extra batteries. I would recommend this to anyone.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Three Stars;good product
3.0 out of 5 stars;NOTHING SPECIAL;... but adequate and well made.  two zip pockets to hold your camera card and other accessories.  could use another pocket to store items and accessories.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Three Stars;It's a little small to keep my camera (Samsung NX30) and the 18/50 lens
3.0 out of 5 stars;Well made;Nice case, but too big for my canon Power shot SX500 .  You need a larger camera or more equipment than I have to get your money's worth out of it.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Small for the Sony Camera that was Recommended.;this case is small for the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX200V 18.2 MP Exmor R CMOS Digital Camera with 30x Optical Zoom and 3.0-inch LCD which it was recomended for. no room for accesories.

3.0 out of 5 stars;Fits ok;It is an OK Fit, the next time i will buy one a little bigger.Because when the sides are full the camera just wont fit.Camera is: Canon PowerShot SX50 HS 12MP
4.0 out of 5 stars;Case Logic DCB-304 with Pan FZ35;I like the product, however withe the Pan FZ35 having the hood on will not fit in properly should be a bit bigger.

5.0 out of 5 stars;Durable material and protects camera good. Not bulky or clumsy;Plenty of cm protection and storage pockets for additional connections/parts. Durable material and protects camera good. Not bulky or clumsy.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Better then expected!;This case has plenty of room for everything from batteries to usb cords. The strap extends long enough to wear it crossbody. Well padded to keep the camera safe.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Three Stars;The red looks more like orange. Fits camera nicely. Construction is quality.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not as big as it appeared!;This is a great case for a small camera, but not a camera the size of a Fuju SL1000. It appeared to be recommended for this camera, so I bought it. But it is not big enough. Once camera is inside, there's no room for anything else that may be a little bulky, like the battery charger. Not even in the outside pockets. Good for a small point and shoot.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;Thanks!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;Just the right size!
3.0 out of 5 stars;camera case;too small to hold extra batteries and sd cards and the camera fits to tight. Needs to be larger so that it would be easier to use the camera
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;Good case.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Camera Bag;According to the description it sounded like it would fit the Canon that I have, however, it is a very snug fit and it's hard to get the camera out of the case.
3.0 out of 5 stars;beware of size;did not fit my camera even tho the bag description included my model as one that would fit. otherwise, well made case.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;nice
3.0 out of 5 stars;Too small;This is a nicely designed case but could use a little more space where the camera fits in the middle section because of the zoom lenses that are built in to most digital cameras today.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great for Cannon SX50;When i order it, i was not sure if it was going to work for my SX 50. But it just fit great. I recomend it for that type of cameras
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;excellent
3.0 out of 5 stars;Three Stars;Good for when I am doing personal photography and want to carry my entire gear bag.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great bag;My PowerShot SX520 fits perfect in this bag, the pockets on teh side are great to store the charger and the extra battery and memory.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;thanks
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;Nice case
2.0 out of 5 stars;Disappointing;I bought this bag at the same time as a new Sony digital superzoom camera.  It was a disappointment.  While the extra pockets were nice, the bag lacked padding and felt flimsy.  I will be returning as I found a levepro bag that is a little bit more, but has significantly more padding.  When paying for a nice camera, a nice padded bag is a must to protect your investment!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Camera bag a little too small.;I bought it for the Fujifilm HS55EXR, which was the recommendation. It's a nice bag but a little small for this camera.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Three Stars;only fits the camera anything bulky won't allow easy insertion of the camera
5.0 out of 5 stars;Case for Canon SX30is;This case is just perfect for my SX30is.  There is enough room in the side pockets for my charger, battery, and my spare battery as well.  This case is just the right size, not too bulky.

5.0 out of 5 stars;Fits Nikon Coolpix L340;Bought the Nikon Coolpix L340 and it did perfectly in this case. Plenty of storage for spare batteries plus more.
5.0 out of 5 stars;like it much;Is what it says it is. Does what it says it does. True to photos.. Get it if youre wondering if its quality, it is.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;Very nice
3.0 out of 5 stars;Three Stars;Almost fits D3300, get a bigger one if you are looking for some more space
3.0 out of 5 stars;Three Stars;Nothing wrong with the case for the camera, just a little big for my liking
3.0 out of 5 stars;A little bulky.;I know that it fits the camera but I just have to become more adapt at using it.  I was used to carrying my point & shoot camera in my purse.

5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfecto;Perfecto muy buena calidad
2.0 out of 5 stars;Too Small For Me!;This bag is way smaller than it looks! I expected it to be much bigger. Guess I didn't pay attention to the dimensions. Will give it to my husband for his camera. I bought a Nikon camera bundle and all of the accessories will not fit into this bag--not even close to the size bag I need!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good product just doesn't work for the camera I bought;A very well made bag but the camera I got at the same time doesn't fit unless you take the hood off the camera and then there isn't enough room left to take anything else in the bag.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Pretty awesome;Pretty awesome bag. My canon sx30is fits perfectly with the battery charger. not too much spare space, just the perfect size. I love how case logic makes bags/cases just the right size(have a laptop case,which is awesome too).
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not big enough, yet too big;Would be nice if it had an extra compartment for another lens... for the Nex-3 it is too big, yet for any other camera it is too small. It is well made though.
5.0 out of 5 stars;works great. fit is perfect and comfortable to carry;got this for my Canon DSLR, works great. fit is perfect and comfortable to carry. recommended
3.0 out of 5 stars;Three Stars;Great product but this case ended up being too small for our Nikon.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Three Stars;A bit small for my camera but it is made well.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;bueno
2.0 out of 5 stars;You get what you pay for.;An adequately built case but poor in design. It barely hold my Kodak Z640 camera and will not accommodate the lens adapter. When wearing the shoulder strap the case flap opens away you and the zipper zips towards you. Very awkward to open. My 9 year old TEK case with velcro and latch and longer shoulder strap with pad still the best. I just can't find them anymore.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Three Stars;The compartments size was smaller than I expected so only the camera fits into the case.

4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;Well designed.
5.0 out of 5 stars;nice fit;fit my Nikon D3200 with 18-55mm lense perfectly
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect for the FZ47;Fits the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ47 perfectly.It holds the lens hood and the camera in the pouch well, and holds the charger and cord in one side.. leaving the other side open.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good case for a smaller camera;Smaller than expected. Barely fits my Nikon D3300 and one lense. Good case for a smaller camera.
3.0 out of 5 stars;NOT CORRECTLY RECOMMENDED;I got the Fujifilm XS1 and THIS bag was recommended to buy with it, however it does not fit at all.I need the larger one.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;Excelente
2.0 out of 5 stars;no fluff;I ordered this bag along with a new Canon SX40 as the detail said it was for superzooms.  It is a nice bag, but little to no padding.  I have a Lowepro for an SX10 and it fits well and has twice the padding. Im not sure this bag from case logic would protect my gear from an 8'drop. not going to chance it.
3.0 out of 5 stars;In the picture looks larger;In the picture looks larger, but otherwise the case is padded enough for camera security and other utensils. The divisions between the different bags are reinforced.
1.0 out of 5 stars;I thought it is a good size for my canon camera;It is irrelevant, the picture you see on amazon web and the actual bag. Over zoom images it seems big for the camera. I thought it is a good size for my canon camera, but actually it is so small you can't put a can of coke. The irony is, if you return it, you pay for it. It costs half price of the bag.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Three Stars;Smaller than expected but I can still fit my Nikon 3300 in it.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Three Stars;not big enough for DSLR with lens attached
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good but...;This suggested model is of good quality but too tight for the camera we bought. It is a recommended product with care to ensure its dimensions.
2.0 out of 5 stars;SIZE MATTERS;Are you sure you had the P 520 in mind when you sent this. I could hardly get the camera in this case let alone with  any of the accessories that come with it  The camera would not fit without laying it on its side. There was not room for the lens to fit with the camera sitting on its bottom..
3.0 out of 5 stars;Tight fit for LUMIX FX70;It works but it's very smug and there is no room for extras besides maybe a couple cards and a battery.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great bag for Olympus Pen-E PL6;Love this bag. We bought it for our Olympus Pen-E PL6 and it works great.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;good
4.0 out of 5 stars;I like it;Works good
3.0 out of 5 stars;Nice Camera-Video Recorder Bag;while this ia a cut rate bag it's about all you ned for smaller cameras and it looks like it cost more than you paid for it
3.0 out of 5 stars;not too bad...;giving it 2 starts because the case is smaller than I expected.  other than that, it's a decent case for a small digital camera.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Did not fit my Cannon;Canon EOS Rebel T3 with 18-55mm Lens did NOT fit in this case.  Otherwise, case seemed fine, reasonable quality, reasonable price at around $11.

3.0 out of 5 stars;Three Stars;It's a compact camera bag. Maybe I should of considered a larger one for a little more space.
3.0 out of 5 stars;its ok;Its really small and not much padding but a good price
3.0 out of 5 stars;It's okay;I don't particularly care too much about this case.  It does it's purpose and I give it three stars because it doesn't offer any WOW factors.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Kind of small;Was smaller then I though
5.0 out of 5 stars;Five Stars;Good design easy to carry holds all the stuff for a point and shoot with a zoom
3.0 out of 5 stars;I wish it was a littlew bigger;"Size is just enough to fit my Fuji camera and a couple of spare batteries. Quality is OK. The key word is ""compact"""

3.0 out of 5 stars;Three Stars;It's a nice case but it's a bit too small for my needs.

3.0 out of 5 stars;Small for Camera;Have to face the lens of the camera up, or you can't get it in the bag...a little too small for this camera...More Chinese stuff....
3.0 out of 5 stars;Nice case.;Exactly what I expected. Nice case.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Three Stars;really small. doesnt allow for much, if any, extra stuff.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Nice case;I thought the bag would be a little bigger.. Its just the right size for me to turn the camera sideways in order for it to fit in bag
3.0 out of 5 stars;Three Stars;exelente
5.0 out of 5 stars;A great case.;Excellent quality. Low price. Fits my camera, a Lumix G5 and I have the same one for a Kodak Easyshare 30x DSLR.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Smaller than it looks;I read the reviews before I bought this, and they warned me.  It's ONLY BIG ENOUGH FOR THE CAMERA.  You can't put anything else at all in there.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect fit;Very well made and protective. Have dropped camera when it was in bag, and zero damage to camera.  Strongly reccomend.

3.0 out of 5 stars;It's so tight;The bag is nice but owe so tight to fit my camera.  It just shouldn't take over a minute to get the camera into the bag and get it securely zipped.

3.0 out of 5 stars;Case Logic Camera Case;The camera case could be a little larger.  Cords, plugs, adapters and such are a little cramped in this case.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Be sure to check the size you need!;Beware.  The description does not make it clear that this is for a small camera.  It does not really fit an SLR, certainly not one with extra lenses and gear.Instead:AmazonBasics Large DSLR Gadget Bag

5.0 out of 5 stars;Good case;Small, perfect fit for our camera. Holds all power options and light weight. Zippers are good quality.  Priced just perfect.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Too small;"I have a Canon Mark III and this bag is too small to fit the camera with the lens.  Even when the lens is off and it is ""body only"" it is still extremely difficult to get the camera inside the bag.  Not a lot of padding and not really what I thought it would be.  I do not recommend this product unless you have a small-ish camera and you are on a tight budget."
3.0 out of 5 stars;Three Stars;kinda small
3.0 out of 5 stars;Its a tight fit.;The pockets are very snug and don't allow much room for anything. The camera itself barely fits. But it works.

2.0 out of 5 stars;Just okay in built quality;The built quality of this bag is very good.  However this cannot be used for the nikon D3100 with kit lens.  It simply can't fit.  You can use this for any small camera but certainly not the nikon D3100.

4.0 out of 5 stars;Ok;Ok
5.0 out of 5 stars;Awesome;This charger is perfect for on the go to easily plug in somewhere and I also use it in my car. Like that it doesnt have the long wire it literally just plugs in and my watch sits right on it.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good for travel;This is a nice charger for travel. No wires and it is compact so it doesn't take up much space.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Convenient;Love this ! So much better than cords hanging around ! Charges fast
5.0 out of 5 stars;This charger has saved me a couple times;There has been a couple times where I forgot to bring my Apple Watch charger and this little thing has saved me. Also there has been one or two instances where my watch failed to charge on its stand overnight due to a failed update and I was running out the door with a nearly dead watch. Once I got the office, I just plugged in this thing, set my watch on it for 30 minutes, and I had enough charge to get to lunchtime where I topped it off again.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great for Traveling!;I like how small this charger is for traveling! It only charges my Apple Watch 86%, and once in a while it doesn’t take to the watch so doesn’t charge at all. I’ve learned to take the watch off of it and to wipe sweat or water off of it to make sure it’s really dry. I still like it and it mostly gets the job done. However, I’ve found that most of my Apple products like Apple chargers instead of different brands.
4.0 out of 5 stars;On the go;Doesn’t charge very fast but works for on the go.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Okay…but not totally portable.;This little gadget has to be attached to a power source while charging.  Not really what I was looking for
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not dual-side USB;The very first plug I tried to use this with I realized the charger is not dual sided like the product description claims.  It can only enter the plug upside down.  This plug is a 3-prong adaptor so the adaptor can’t be turned around in the socket.  This plug is what I usually take with me when traveling domestically so I would have to take a seperate 2-prong butt just for the watch.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Makes my watch hot;I’m not sure if this is safe.  My watch gets super hot when charging.  Not like when I use the OM charger.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great;Realized last minute that I didn’t have the right type of charger to take on a trip to England, ordered this and it arrived very quickly and worked perfectly in my plug adaptor on my trip.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Very Nice Portable Charger;Very Nice Portable Charger.Pros. Sturdy,Small,Compact,Strong Magnet. Cons. Slow,slightly wobbly.Overall Good Buy
5.0 out of 5 stars;This Iwatch charger is super.;This compact Iwatch charger works better than the charger that comes with the watch,
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great charger for Apple Watch!;"This is super convenient for travel in the car.  Charges the watch while you drive!  I use it regularly.  The only thing I can say that is  slightly negative is the claim to ""fast charge"".  It charges fine - just not super fast.  Plus the fact that it gets pretty hot while charging (I am thinking that this is an Apple watch issue due to the fact that my iPhone 12 does the same thing).  I certainly do recommend this product."
4.0 out of 5 stars;It’s not bad;I wish it felt less fragile
3.0 out of 5 stars;Long charge;It works just takes a long time to reach a charge
4.0 out of 5 stars;Easy to take anywhere;The company reached out to replace the one I had originally purchased to ensure I had one that worked well. I appreciate their responsiveness.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Direction matters;I like that this is compact and not wired for traveling, BUT you have to pay attention to the orientation of the plug. If it’s vertical instead of horizontal because of the USB receiver the watch wants to slide off the charger and gets an incomplete charge when it does stay put.
4.0 out of 5 stars;I think it's ok?;"I was really excited to get this and try it out because of an upcoming trip. It's ok I think - here's why. First, I used an Apple ""cube"" to plug the charger in. It wouldn't work. Tried another one. Still didn't work. Used a different usb to plug it into and it worked. It seemed to take a long time to charge though - longer than the original Apple charger. Guess it will do, I just expected it to perform like the Apple charger. I like the pink color and it was really simple to figure out."
3.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charge.;Does not charge as fast as I hoped. But great to travel with.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Handy as a backup - not a quick charge;This little portable charger is great for a bit of a charge in an emergency - or if you know you’ll be sitting at your desk, etc. for a while… but it’s definitely not a substitute for a ‘regular’ Apple Watch charger.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Small and compact;I’m a bus driver and stay overnight on runs 4 days a week, it works great either at a hotel room or with a portable backpack, I’ve even used it with a 12v charger while on the go. I definitely will be getting a backup just incase this one breaks.
5.0 out of 5 stars;great!;Great price and design.  Compact, easy to carry with me.  Even like that it comes in pink (it makes it stand out from the mountain of other cords).  Totally recommended.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great iwatch charger;Dislike the thin loop to connect to keysOverall great product, cheap & does exactly what’s expected
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good Product;This product works well. It is small enough to take around with you. When it comes to battery power it takes a while to charge, so I recommend using it only when you are not going to need your watch right away. Mine takes about 30 minutes to an hour to charge long enough for it to last a whole day. The product itself is well made, but you can tell that it is dropped it will break right away.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Pretty good charger;It’s convenient for traveling and so my cats won’t chew any cords. It just takes a little to charge.
4.0 out of 5 stars;decent if you don't want in display mode;decent if you don't want in display mode
4.0 out of 5 stars;Handy and good to Have;Very handy and good to have. Charging anytime.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Crashes;I bought this for my desk at work so I can charge my watch before I hit the gym. I plug it in around 40% battery life. Hour later it says fully charged and dies within 10 minutes. It has happened a handful of times now. Not worth the risk of damaging my watch.
3.0 out of 5 stars;it’s ok;it’s ok since i got it on sale it takes about hour and half to charge my iwatch
3.0 out of 5 stars;Deceiving;Not what I expected, I need an adapter to use on my computer and it needs to be connected to an outlet or computer in order to charge the watch. I thought it could get charge and I can use it on the go whenever my watch was low as oppose to have to either way use an outlet. For that purpose I can just use my regular apple watch charger.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Newdery Apple Watch charger;The small size makes it easy to carry around.
4.0 out of 5 stars;OK;These little chargers work great for travel or saving space.  But don't drop them or tug on them. They break very easily.
4.0 out of 5 stars;It is not charge the watch it was dead this morning. I will not use it again;It did not charge. In fact drained the power. My watch was totally dead this morning. I will not use it again which disappoints me as it was a convenient style
4.0 out of 5 stars;Very convenient;Yes -- it's not the fastest charge but that's fine. It's easy to carry along for traveling and easy to use with your laptop if juice is running low.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not much power, but it can help in a pinch;This charger is extremely easy to use, plug it into a USB outlet and set your Watch on it. I've been trying to use my Apple Watch (6) while sleeping more lately, which means I need to get a charge added to my Watch in the middle of the day. I bought this so I could take it with me easily and use it while working. And while it does start to charge right away, it's incredibly slow. I left it on the charger for an hour when the Watch had 15% battery and it had only gained about 20% power. I guess this could be useful for travel, if you intend to leave it on the charger all night long, but if you want to grab a quick charge this isn't going to do a great job.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Just bought another!;I’ve had this for about a year now and it’s saved me multiple times. Great to keep in my purse or vehicle to give a bump in my watch’s charge during long days or overnight trip. It’s holding up well still works perfectly. So I had to get another to just leave on the 2nd floor. For $10 it’s pretty great!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Watch charger;Great watch charger but not always. Most of the times it will charge just great.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Does it’s job!;I like it because it’s easy to throw my watch on BUT it’s kind of awkward because of the way it plugs into charging blocks. It tends to come out of the charging brick slightly and I find that my watch wasn’t being charged at all. Good value for the money though and I still use it every day
4.0 out of 5 stars;Pretty great;It is very self explanatory. It works the best when plugged into a portable charger or something. I use a MacBook, so it is not comparable unless I have an adapter. So using it with a standard socket block would be ideal.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Problem Solver;Between nursing school and 12 hour night shifts I have a huge problem remembering to charge my electronics. This little guy works perfect in my car with a USB adapter. Actually charges pretty fast and saves me from having to go through Apple Watch withdrawal symptoms every few days.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not a fast charger;I love the convenience of just plugging it in while on the road and of course the lack of wires, just wish it was a fast charger.
4.0 out of 5 stars;It doesn’t charge fast it take a long time to charge;Take long to chart
5.0 out of 5 stars;Love;Love
5.0 out of 5 stars;Charging Adapter;Originally thought it would charge on the goLater realized it needed an external power sourceBut works fine in my car when my watch is running low. Thank You - Great product!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Watch it with your case;I loved the compact design of this item. The only downfall is that it can be tricky to use with a case on your watch.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn’t charge fast;This doesn’t charge quickly!!
5.0 out of 5 stars;This is the best!;I love that I don't have to carry a long corded charger for my Apple Watch, this charges quickly and is a breeze to pack. I just leave this in my travel case.
3.0 out of 5 stars;works sort of;I am changing my review after about a months use.  It is very tricky to get the watch on it in exactly the right spot so it charges.  many times I have  put my watch on it and came back in several hours to find it is totally dead.  The other thing is when you do get your watch in the right spot, the watch gets hotter than it ever did on an apple charger.  it is hot enough I worry about negative effects on the battery life.  I have stopped using it.Old review:  small size with no cable is a plus.  we use it in an rv with outles.  the magnet is strong enough to hold the watch in any direction.  does exactly what we need.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Great idea, but inconsistent.;I’ve only had this for 2-3 months and only used it 4-5 times. However, only 1-2 times has it actually charged my watch. I’ve used it in multiple different outlets (around my house, in hotels, in my car) and with a portable charger, but often it doesn’t charge my watch and instead actually appears to be draining the battery even more. My roommate has one and uses it every night and hasn’t shared any problems with it. Not sure if I just got a defective one or my watch is too old to be compatible or what. It inconsistently charges my watch so I never know what to expect. If it worked, I would absolutely love it because it’s perfect for traveling or keeping in a purse/work bag!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Convenient;Purchased for on the go charging for my power bank. Works great.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great for Travel! Minimal Issues;I absolutely love this Apple Watch charger! It’s small, compact, great for traveling, and a cute color. ONLY issues is that it slides out of the USB port ever so slightly sometimes doesn’t charge when you think it is. Also if a USB port is sideways (hotels as an example have this) obviously you cannot use this device.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not4ULTRA;Loved the idea for portability.  However, after attempting over half dozen ports of varying sources I have determined this unit will not charge the latest Apple Watch ULTRA in a reasonable amount of time. Cord supplied with watch= under 2Hours. This item will not provide half life charge after 36hours.  This might work better for the other models, but I have not had these to compare.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Love this!;This is the 2nd time I purchased this (I misplaced the other). It is so convenient, takes up less space, quick charges and overall looks and performs better than using the traditional cord that comes with the watch.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works great;Great for travel or school
2.0 out of 5 stars;Mine only delivers to the watch while it’s plugged in;It says it’s portable. Not sure they understand what that means. It only charges my watch while plugged into a usb outlet. Kinda defeats the purpose. I was hoping to carry it in my purse but it doesn’t charge the watch unless the charger is plugged into a usb port. Maybe a truly portable charger/battery pack type thing doesn’t exist.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Had such high hopes.  Seemed to work but does not... :(;Apple Watch 5 42mm. I have bunch of Apple cords w. watch charge pucks but hoped for something a bit more convenient for travel.  This seemed to fit the bill.Seems to start charging when plugged in to a compatible USB outlet. Then it cuts off without charging the watch.Tried a bunch of different USB ports at different ratings.  Result is the same.  DOES NOT CHARGE THE WATCH. Cannot depend on this thing. Back it goes...EDIT: 25 Jun 2021The customer service contacted me after the return and apologized for the mishap - and informed me a new batch is being manufactured to higher specs.  They promised a replacement unit in return for a fair review. when the new batch comes out.  This shows they care about the customer feedback and are willing to resolve problems.  Will give them a couple months and update when the new unit shows up.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Sloooooooooowwww;Charges too slowly to really be usable. I returned it.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Apple Watch;This is a lot more convient than the charger cable that came with the Apple watch.  Anyone with a computer can plug the unit into a port and leave it there for use.  Cost is well worth the cost!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Love it;I always forget my charger when I go away for a weekend and my watch usually is dead now I don’t need to worry I have this awesome little charger to take with me.  Works great!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Feels very cheap;It’s super lightweight and made of plastic. Charging my Apple Watch S7 very slow. Though it is easy to carry with, but I don’t feel like it’s very good quality.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Better than nothing;Not very fast chargingDon’t charge to full no matter how long you charge
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect.;I often forget to put my watch to charge at the end of the day. This little charger is so convenient. It's so much better than taking the whole cable and it getting tangled in my purse or with my other chargers.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Works great but flimsy;This charges as fast as the original charger. It’s convenient because I can pop it into my bag and take it with me when I travel. My only complaint is this is pretty flimsy. I bumped into it and it came apart. It all snapped back together and works fine. Just wish it were more sturdy.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good enough;I bought this because my cat chewed my original watch charger, and I can say that the charge is slower than what I was used to with my original charger, but for the price and quality you still can’t beat this
3.0 out of 5 stars;It’s good for taking with you, but other than that it’s not very useful.;Slowest charger of my LIFE. My watch is constantly “dinging” because it loses connectivity but then reconnects right away. It would be very useful for traveling and I take it to work with me everyday, but put it in a room where you don’t have to hear it ding every 5 seconds and leave 2 hours for it to charge.
4.0 out of 5 stars;It works as advertised. I like that there’s no cord make my table cleaner.;I like it
4.0 out of 5 stars;Better than I thought…;I’m somewhat embarrassed to admit it was weeks off ‘meh’ use before I noticed the removable film protection on the business end of the charger … a clear heads-up would be useful. I really like the physical form of this device — compact, sturdy, satisfying attention to detail — and since I removed the protective film, I’m satisfied with the performance. The charger runs a little warm, I think, which leaves room for improvement, but that doesn’t keep me from giving it a thumbs-up.
3.0 out of 5 stars;This was a good tool, until it wasn't;This was great at the beginning. No problem charging my watch.However, after 3-4 months, it just died. Wouldn't charge my watch anymore. It's compact and easy to carry around, so there's that. Maybe it was just a fluke. But I did have to buy another charger from another company. It's a very good idea, just didn't work for me. I would have expected at least 6 months on this item, and hoped for more!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Very slow charger;Will not fully charge my watch even if left overnight. Do not recommend. *update - seller contacted me offering a refund, I assume in exchange for an amended review. I did not accept bc it was my fault for not reading other reviews. This morning my watch did finally charge to 100% so apparently it is just extremely slow.
2.0 out of 5 stars;In a word, 'mediocre'.;At first glance, this product is both attractive and possessed of many positive reviews. The compact form is pleasing to me, as the OEM (Apple) charger comes with a cable that I worry about damaging in my bag. The 'leather' tag hanging off the end is a tasteful accent.Unfortunately, this device has few redeeming qualities by measure of its function. It charges slowly. So slowly that I seethe with hate for it. The Apple Watch doesn't accept too much power to begin with, but this charger seems to suffer from heat dissipation issues and will charge at a rate of approximately 10% per hour.When I think 'travel charger', I'm not planning on going to bed and leaving it on this contraption. I would bring a regular charger for that. This is (in my head) for those times when you've got an hour in a terminal before your flight, and your watch just gave you a low battery warning. This product doesn't work for me. I've gone back to packing the OEM charger, and am much happier for it.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not great for travel at all;I plugged in the charger and laid my watch atop.  After 3 hours watch was only about 1/2 charged.  This also causes extreme heat for the watch. DON’T BUY THIS
3.0 out of 5 stars;Upside down;I originally bought this product to use in our RV when we travel but most of the places we could use it, the outlets were either sideways or upside down.  Next time I would try to find one that would be adjustable.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Charges slowly, heats up but works.;This charger overall works and is very portable however it does get quite hot when charging and it charges very slowly.  I like it for when I’m away from home.  I’ve even used it to charge my watch in my car.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Slow but otherwise good;I really Like the design of this charger. It is great for travel with its small size. What it falls short is the charging speed. It is about 1/2 the speed of the original Apple charging cable. I will try different AC charging cubes and report back later.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Works but gets quite hot;The charger does work, but it gets hit and makes the back of my watch so hot I can’t put it on right away. It makes me a bit nervous.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Sturdy, but starting to show wear after a couple weeks;Love this form factor, and it's sturdier than some other options. Weirdly, after two weeks, it's started randomly stopping charging for a second every minute or two. It starts charging again almost immediately so it doesn't slow down the charging much but it does mean the watch screen comes on constantly which makes it no good for overnight charging
4.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect travel accessory.;I like the size, like that it has a cap to keep USB connecter clean. I use this in my car, plug it into USB on back of center console and it charges while I drive on long trips, the magnetic connector keeps watch securely in place till I put it back on my wrist.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works great!;I love how small and portable this charger is, and prefer this style since there is no cord!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Great idea but….;This little cordless charger is such a great idea. I love the fact that you can do away with the cord but… it takes hours to fully charge. It charges much slower than original Apple Watch charger. I guess if you charge overnight it is fine. I wear my watch for as keep tracking so I charge in the morning. Not so great for my needs
3.0 out of 5 stars;dirty;I arrive used and quite dirty.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Convenient but slow;This product is so convenient as I often find myself needing a charged and without one, and I love being able to keep it on my keys. However, the charge is pretty slow so keep that in mind when purchasing. Makes sense for price though
4.0 out of 5 stars;It works;Works as advertised. Would be better with small extension cord...at least in the car i drive.  Overall, I'm satisfied with this product.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Worked for less than a month;I only used it maybe 6 times. Went to use it after returning from a 10 day road trip, and it almost melted both itself and my watch.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great for laptops;Not good for charging in your car, there isn’t much room when you plug it in the usb. It gets hot quick but it’s nice and sturdy.
4.0 out of 5 stars;very position sensitive;When the watch is perfectly positioned, it charges fine.  But if it's slightly off (which is easy to be), it doesn't charge
3.0 out of 5 stars;Carga muy lento;Carga muy lento
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not easy to use for my husband;Please read everything about this charger before you purchase it.
5.0 out of 5 stars;So much better than a cord!;Perfect for traveling so you don’t have to have a cord that will just get tangled up!
3.0 out of 5 stars;It was great while it lasted;A friend recommended this charger for my Apple Watch. It worked great until about 1-2 weeks ago. I put the watch on the charger at night & the next morning the watch isn’t charged.  I tried different outlets & it still doesn’t charge the watch.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Love it;Happy with the product small and quick charge
4.0 out of 5 stars;It’s decent.;The design is great. I like that I don’t have to unplug my watch charger from the wall when I travel. It didn’t charge my watch fully from a pocket charger. I’m guessing it might have been the battery source and not this device.
5.0 out of 5 stars;It’s really Noice;It’s noice, but it
4.0 out of 5 stars;cost effective;Works well, but the leather piece broke easily.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect for my SUV!!! For traveling this is a must!;I like that it’s not bulky! I can charge my Phone and watch in my car using one port! It’s perfect!!
5.0 out of 5 stars;This is my 2nd one;I purchased it again after I couldn't find my other one.  I spent a long time reviewing similar items and to be honest, it's the least expensive and definitly is reliable.  I sometimes forget to charge my Apple watch overnight and out the door I go with a dead watch.  I can plug it in to USB port in my car and my watch is charged.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great p;Small, compact, and great for travel!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works as advertised.;Great for traveling.  Does what it’s supposed to do.  The magnet doesn’t always align and charge but a little wiggle to the watch and it will begin charging.  For the price, I think it’s a great purchase.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Heats Up Watch;Does not charge fast. It heats up the watch so quickly that I only used it a couple of times for 20 minutes.
4.0 out of 5 stars;👍;So far so good. Small and convenient.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Worked for 7 months;I was very pleased with this charger for months. It charged slowly and did seem to heat up. More and more as time went by. Now it heats up, but does not charge. I am sad.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect for work!;This is for my when my watch dies while I’m still at work. It’s small so easy to carry around with you instead of bringing a long charging cord. 👍🏼
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great Little Product;Great Little Product, already been used, well packaged and Well ahead of Delivery Scheduled10/10 Guy's :)
1.0 out of 5 stars;Overheats and crashes;This immediately went into the garbage.  Did nothing but get incredibly hot and crash.  No charging accomplished.  I’m not going to ruin my watch with this so I threw it away.  Lesson learned, you get what you pay for.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Dumb;This seems to be upside down.  I’m sure I will be able to use in some usb outlets but most of them are set up so the magnet side is facing down instead of up
5.0 out of 5 stars;Compact I watch charger;Easy to use, fits easily in your purse or pocket and charges in a timely manor.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't charge;When I put the watch on the chargers it acts like it's starts charging but then stops a couple minutes later and continues to start and stop. I tried different charging blocks and different plugs and nothing made it work right.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Super convenient!;Great Apple Watch charger for on the go!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice to have charger;I got this just for travel and it works well. My only complaint is the orientation of the device makes it diffiicult to balance the watch so that it gets charged. It needs to be able to rotate while so that the face is horizontal regardless of the USB port orientation. Otherwise, I'd give it 5 stars.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Gets the job done after a few hours;I didn’t think this charger worked at 1st but after a couple tries I finally got it to work. It charges a little slow but it gets the job done after a few hours.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Gets a little warm while charging.;Love that I don’t have yet another cord laying around. Perfect for travel.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Quality great products;Loved the color convient
2.0 out of 5 stars;Description is deceiving;Says that’s it’s cordless but it needs to be plugged into a USB port and there’s no battery. Not worth the cost.
1.0 out of 5 stars;This is junk;This device is junk.  No wonder it's so cheap.  My phone pings when put on it and charges for about 3 seconds.  Then stops charging, pings again, charges for three seconds.  And keeps repeating.  The phone can ding for hours and not get a charge.  Don't waste your money.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Great concept -- terrible product.  Don't Waste Your Time;Some of the reviews were a red flag but this product looked better than the others and I hoped my experience would be different.  Unfortunately, the  charger originally shipped did not work and I returned it for a replacement.  But the replacement did not fare any better.  Both chargers did not charge watch at all -  even after 12 hours.  In fact, they seemed to drain power and created such heat that I think it is a fire hazard.  I tried the device with different charging blocks made by Apple and other manufacturers with same result -- no charge and extreme heat.  My watch got so hot, I was concerned it might be permanently damaged.  Thankfully, it still works and charges quickly with the original Apple charging cord.  I can get a full charge in about 2-3 hrs. I hate having to travel with the long corded charger and this product appeared to offer an alternative.  Regrettably, this product is not the answer.  The only good thing I can say is that they were quick in sending me a replacement, and ultimately a full refund, but I wasted a lot of time trying this out.  Hopefully, you don't have to waste yours.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Charges way too slowly;When this charger arrived I thought it was a super cute idea. It’s compact and plugs directly into a USB adapter. I wish I had used it before the return window ended. I’m traveling and used it and it was charging for about 7 hours and was only at 81%! It was at 25% when I charged it. I mean - I can still get by on 81%, but that’s a long time to not have a full charge. If they changed that, this would be the perfect charger. Love that there’s no wire!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Small and sturdy;Perfect size for traveling and charges pretty fast! Great value!
5.0 out of 5 stars;So simple. Leave it in the bathroom and charge when showering.;Genius.
2.0 out of 5 stars;It took a very long time to charge my watch on this!;Took much longer to charge my watch!
1.0 out of 5 stars;DRAINS BATTERY INSTEAD OF CHARGING IT!;First I thought the plug wasn't securely in, so I tried again with a different outlet. Then I thought maybe it was the plug itself, and tried a different plug. Then I tried it again when the watch was half-charged and after a while, the watch showed that it was in the red zone—yes, people, this charger DE-CHARGED the watch. It has a short-circuit, evidently, and you should save your money and get a certified, reliable charger so you are not up a creek wen you need your watch to work! Also, fire hazard.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Works but gets hot during use;I bought this to give my apple watch a boost during the workday, otherwise, it dies before bedtime. This serves its purpose. It doesn't necessarily save any space, but it's easy to identify in my tech bag with other cables and adapters. My major complaints are that it seems to charge more slowly than my regular cable and it gets very warm, even hot, during use.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Super convenient.;I have my original Apple Watch charger rolled up in a charging stand on my bedside table and it is a pain to take it out every time I travel so I needed something easier. This I just keep on my keychain and have it whenever my watch needs charged, it has come in handy so many times already!
5.0 out of 5 stars;cluster-free and easy to carry;I used to use a cable watch charge and carry it to everywhere, it is extremely cluster and inconvenient. what a amazing product I have now. small device and easy to carry. I recommend this one to everyone.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Poorly made;Product came fast but made poorly fell apart not useable junk
4.0 out of 5 stars;It’s nice to have in a pinch, but does take longer than expected to charge.;Easy to take on trips, but takes longer to charge than expected.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn’t work in all charging ports;When I plugged it into my wall charger it wouldn’t do anything. I plugged it into my computer & my watch kept chiming every minute or so like it does when you first start to charge it. But it works fine in the car charger, and my portable power pack, which is where I plan to use it most. Just aggravating. But I needed one quickly so don’t have time to return it & try others.
4.0 out of 5 stars;It works;Works ok but charges a bit slower than OEM that came with the watch.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Slow and heats up;I returned it. It was stylish and handy so I am disappointed to have to say, it is not worth $10.Charges super slow and gets hot very fast.I spent over $900 on my Apple watch 7 (gold steel +apple care+tax) so I can’t risk it over this cheap floozy.  I was so into this cute charger that fits everywhere. I wish it had worked!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Great while it worked!;This little travel Apple Watch charger was great for about six months and then it stopped working. It’s a very simple design  there was no way to figure out what went wrong!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Small, compact, but slow to charge & watch can fall of connector when knocked off balance;It’s small, convenient—but slow to charge & a little cumbersome to balance your watch atop while it’s plugged into a USB port in your car or on your computer. You may need to jimmy something together to get your watch to maintain the magnetic hold and fully connect/charge. It’s also slow to charge. Smaller and more compact than carrying the charging wire everywhere you go though.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great customer service;Quit working after 2nd charge. Company notified me and has corrected this with me and has switch manufacturers! Great customer service!
4.0 out of 5 stars;It gets very hot.;It is very convenient! It gets very hot though so that worries me.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not a wireless charger;Does not work without being connected to a power source. Why do I need it to be keychain and easily portable if it is not truly a wireless charger? Very disappointed.
5.0 out of 5 stars;De lo mejor;Súper práctico su espacio lo hace perfecto para llevar donde quiera, y carga mi Apple Watch súper rápido.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Just what i was looking for;While it doesn't charge as fast as the cable chargers, this does the trick when you need absolutely needed.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good charger;Good charger.Only thing I have noticed - it only charges my watch to 85% and no further.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Looks good but didn't work;Bought this for a trip a month before we left.  Tried to use it and it did not charge any of our watches, not even sure if it charged.  By the time we returned from trip return window closed and was unable to send back.  Was a nice pocket size design, sad it did not work out.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Worked for 2 months then stopped charging;The first 2 months it worked perfectly. It was awesome not having to deal with the cord. One morning I grabbed my watch and it was HOT. And the battery was dead. Thought it was odd so I moved the charger to a different outlet for an hour. Still my watch was not charged and device was obviously not working. Can’t return it. Waste of money.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charging;Is really useful
3.0 out of 5 stars;Cool but slow;Useful since it plugs in much easier than the long cords from Apple.  Much slower than the Apple charger.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works great. Very helpful;Works great. Very handy when traveling
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not working;It doesn’t work. It only generates excessive heat and nothing charge into the watch. Good concept and bad implementation.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect iwatch charger solution;This is the perfect, small, easily stored solution to charging your iwatch. Instead of all the cords we need for all of our electronics, use this small plug to charge your iwatch
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good for back up !;Nice little gadget !Good for back up !
2.0 out of 5 stars;Stops working randomly while charging;I was very excited about this charger. I planned to keep it in my car so I could charge my watch during my commute to and from work. Over my hour long commute, it never charged my watch more than a few percentage points. I noticed that it kept disconnecting and reconnecting throughout my drive and I assumed it was because it was sliding off the charger as I drove around, but I tried using this at home In several different USB ports and have the same issue. It also makes my watch very hot (I guess from constantly connecting and disconnecting), and I’m worried it will damage my watch if I keep trying to use it. The idea of the product sounds better than the actual product ended up being.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Connection is too sporadic;When it stays connected, it charges as expected.  Somehow, someway, the magnets get tired and decide to take a break and not hold on anymore.  Bad unit...possibly, not worth the hassle to figure it out.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great for travel!;This is great for traveling or just for a second charger.  It’s small like a thumb drive, so it can fit in your purse, pocket or bag without  all the bulky wires.  Good purchase.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Gets hot way too fast!;Doesn’t charge very well and takes long to even hit 80%
2.0 out of 5 stars;Annoying;Once my watch has charged i have to reset it each time because my screen gets zoomed in. I know this is a charger issue due to the fact that I’ve used a different charger and I don’t have this issue.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Takes for ever to charge and heats up.;Bought this in the impression that I would be able to charge my Apple Watch in the car but it takes for ever to charge and after 15 mins it begins to heat up. The magnet is just like the original charger which is great and the design is really nice too! But, once again practicality is what are the cons here.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great portable charger, just one complaint...;Great portable Apple Watch charger. My only complaint is that the rubber cover for the end of the usb plug isn’t solid, so it doesn’t actually protect or prevent damages to the plug.
3.0 out of 5 stars;By no means is it quick charging;Fine in a pinch if you use a computer with a USB port that is easily accessible.  Slow charging though!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great for travel;This charger is great for travel. I love being able to charge my watch on my laptop without a cord.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn’t work;Bought this for a trip. Didn’t try it out before the trip. Unfortunately, it doesn’t work at all and now I can’t charge my watch.
5.0 out of 5 stars;A Good Charger for Apple Watch;Had a problem with my old charger and bought this charger online.  It’s so easy to carry around without the issue of cable tangling around in my purse.  It’s been working great so far!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good for on the go;I typically forget to charge my Apple Watch so this fits perfectly in my car for on the go charging. It does charge pretty slow so don’t expect the same charging speed as you would get with the actual apple charger.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Gets hot fast;The base and the watch got very hot during use for even a short time. Returning as I don’t want to cause damage to the watch.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Easy to use and carry along;Compact and user friendly
4.0 out of 5 stars;Handy product;Love the convenience of this charger. It’s a great size for everyday use in your purse or backpack. My only complaint is it charges VERY slow. I’m still glad I bought it, it fits my needs.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Fantastic! Small, compact & efficient!!!;Small and efficient, no need for extra cordsLove it
5.0 out of 5 stars;Amazing;I absolutely love this product fast charging and space saver
1.0 out of 5 stars;Does not fully charge Apple Watch Ultra;Great and small charger, however, the description is very misleading. It cannot fully charge the Ultra watch. I am able to get my watch charged to about 4% and no matter the type of watts on the charger it does not move.
4.0 out of 5 stars;I would definitely purchase more;I absolutely love the convenience of this nifty gadget. Definitely purchasing more!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Exceeded expectations;I bought this item back in august and it still works like day 1. Works very well.
3.0 out of 5 stars;It will charge my Apple Watch;This little charger was exactly like I was wanting just beware that the magnet doesn’t seem as strong but my Apple charger.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good for travel only;Not super user friendly bought fir my traveling friend bday I do not need it I do not travel much. It is good if u plug in a USB port but not next if u are home.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn’t charge fast;Everything seems ok about this except it charges probably around half the speed the original charging cable I got with my witch does. I probably would not buy this again unless they solve that issue.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Got my watch hot.;It got my watch hot while charging.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Overall decent product, weak magnet;The product works well in a pinch, however the magnet doesn’t attach well to the watch, so you have to play with it to make sure that it’s charging. Much slower charging speed compared to oem
2.0 out of 5 stars;Takes forever and gets too hot;Great and compact for traveling but it takes way too long to charge my watch. It also gets VERY hot and makes my watch very warm. I no longer use it and I wouldn’t recommend it. Just buy a cord to save yourself the hassle
2.0 out of 5 stars;Flimsy and takes forever to charge;This thing is sooo slow to charge and it gets really hot when you use it. I've also only used it once and its already starting to fall apart.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Must Have;Love it perfect for charging in the car or at the office and great to take on vacation.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great charger for travel;This little charger is perfect foe travel.  I just leaving it in my bag with my travel accessories and it is alway ready to go.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Nice invention but it heats up;It heats up to the pont of hot to touch
2.0 out of 5 stars;Disappointing;It charges incredibly slow. For a full charge it takes about 2 1/2 hours.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Charges very slowly;I was really excited to get this to replace my current one from apple on my desk because I was tired of dealing with another wire hanging from the desk. I got this for my Apple Watch series 5 and was disappointed when I had to wait for almost 4 hours for it to fully charge the watch.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good for traveling;Like that if I’m on the go I can easily change my watch if I need to without having the long cord  Good for traveling
3.0 out of 5 stars;"Good not great; works in a pinch";Works in a pinch but doesn’t charge quickly. I use this as my backup
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not acceptable;It did not change my watch. It stayed the same charging level over several hours showing a charging icon. It only made my watch warm after I gave up on it.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Did not work!;Does not charge watch!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not very reliable source of recharging;Not very reliable. Won’t charge completely as I travel only used once or twice and I just put it up
2.0 out of 5 stars;What's the point?;This is for an Apple Watch and is intended to plug into a computer (or other USB A plug)  So it comes with a USB-A connector that can't even plug into any Apple computer made since 2016 or so. They are now all USB-C only...so why the ancient USB-A here? I guess I didn't read it well enough to realize that the connection wasn't to charge the device's internal battery like a lot of others...which then allows you to charge the watch without being plugged in. However, this has to be connected to an outlet..that makes is really a dumb device...may as well just use the superior charging cable included with the Apple Watch to start with.  Dumb product iMO, YMMV.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works great.;This is a little gem! Take this on a trip or just have it in your purse to charge your watch, it’s great, small, and sturdy.
3.0 out of 5 stars;For travek;I won’t be using this until my next trip. I’m sure it will work fine
3.0 out of 5 stars;Wouldn’t connect with Apple Watch;Wouldn’t connect and charge my watch. Nice idea but didn’t work
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great for travel!;Small and versatile. Ideal for travel and so easy to use! I love the color options, too. Great product!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Broke out of the box!;Junk. Doesn’t work out of the package
3.0 out of 5 stars;Gets hot;Plugs into the car just fine but the watch gets very hot when you go to put it back on. Not sure if that’s normal.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Very slow charging;This is very convenient for traveling but it does not charge the watch very fast.  It takes at least overnight to fully charge.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Does not charge;This item does not work. I have tried multiple power adapters in multiple outlets, I’ve even tried plugging it in to my computer but does not charge the Apple Watch. It says it’s charging but the battery percentage does not change. Even letting it sit on the charger overnight does not put any juice into the watch. Will be returning.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Brittle - Came apart in my travel backpack barely even used.;Used a handful of times.  Kept stored in my backpack for when I travel.  Cover piece fell off after 2 weeks, snapped back into place.  Cover piece came off again and won’t snap back in.  Would not buy again.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Charger gets hot;Charger is practical but gets too hot while in use.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Love this little charger!;I carry this charger in my purse and use it anytime I need to charge my Apple watch.  It charges my watch very quickly!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped Working;I only needed this for travel so I only used this a few times and it quit working. Very disappointed. I liked the idea of it being so compact.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Takes forever to charge with this and watch gets hot;This charger takes forever to charge my watch. If I use the apple charger it charges quickly but this takes half a day.
5.0 out of 5 stars;LOVE THIS FOR TRAVEL;Love this, so convenient for traveling so you don't have to bring a million wires and have them tangle.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Charges So Slowly!;Very slow charger. Compact with no cord, so it is somewhat convenient. However, its slow charging speed makes it pretty useless.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good for travel;Exactly as described! Only negative thing I can say is that the 44mm size watch doesn't work as well with the magnet if not laying flat.
3.0 out of 5 stars;charges my watch much slower than the original charger;very good for traveling but takes much more time to charge the watch
5.0 out of 5 stars;A must have;Like the quality and quick charge. Feels like ceramic and the magnet holds great even for a sideways placement. Definitely going to get a few more for the family to use. Great for traveling.
3.0 out of 5 stars;It heats up and it does well until 93%;Keeps lagging on the last 7% of 100%. Heats up when ever you use it. It does it’s job really well until it reaches 93%.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Pink charger;I used this item for travel.  I love it.  It is so convenient.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Nice products Very good;Very good product work well value for your money good good
1.0 out of 5 stars;Never worked;Charged it right away. And left it on for several hours. Tried charging my watch and nothing.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Great idea;I found it to interfere with other USB items. I connected it to my computer to charge my watch. I also have a wireless mouse and noticed each time I would connect this charger, my mouse would act really slow, almost as if it had low battery. I would leave it for 30 min and could barely have 10% charge. It’s good to use when you aren’t in a hurry and have time to charge
5.0 out of 5 stars;works great saves room;Works the way it's designed to work out of the way
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works very well & compact.;As long as you have some type of usb outlet... you’ll always have power, one of my best purchases, works very well, sturdy & compact.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn’t work!;It charged my watch 10% the entire night when we went camping.  Should have tried it when I received it and not waited. Got another one for a friend coz she likes the size.  Hers doesn’t work either when I asked her to try it. Too late to return so I threw it in the trash.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Súper práctico, útil para viajes o para llevar en el auto.;Producto de uso versátil. Carga excelentemente. Buen diseño
5.0 out of 5 stars;Small and portable.;It was small and convenient, doing the job it was designed for.
1.0 out of 5 stars;"I do not consider this ""portable""...";"I had planned on taking this on a trip and being able to charge my watch when I am out and about.  I had assumed it was chargeable and then I could use it when needed.  Turns out that is NOT the case.  This thing must be plugged into a power source....like the directions say there should be a socket on a laptop...my iPad doesn't have a usb socket...so ultimately I will have to use a power bank and I think if I use a power bank a charger with a cord would be more useful than having to have this ""portable"" thing anchored to the power bank or to the little cube that is plugged into the wall.  I plan to get a backup charger like the one that came with the watch."
2.0 out of 5 stars;Great for traveling;I like this product but if they could only make the USB plug twist 180° it would be much more useful.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Nice;It works but gets hot if you leave it on too long. Great for traveling and the car!!!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Waste of Money!!!;Would have given it 0 stars if I could have. I never think I’m going to be the one that gets the dud, but it did indeed happen this time.This charger never worked. I don’t know if it even ever took a charge. I just know it never charged my Apple Watch. So, either it didn’t take/hold a charge, or it was unable to transfer the charge to my watch. If I ever get another Apple Watch battery/charger, I will get one that has a battery charging light so I’ll at least be able to tell if the thing is charging.Edit: This company contacted me after seeing my negative review and offered me money to remove it. If they had offered me money as reimbursement for the charger that didn’t work, I would have amended my review and said the company attempted to make me whole, but that wasn’t their intention. They just wanted the review removed.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Does it’s job;Charges fine it just gets really hot. Update got a new one it less hot
2.0 out of 5 stars;Looks good, feels good, suddenly stopped working.;Charging is ok, traveling is great,
5.0 out of 5 stars;Easy. Small. Fast charging;Ease of use!  Small and compact!  Fast charging
1.0 out of 5 stars;Dont Recommend, can be a fire hazard;Bought this to have a backup for my family when we traveled if anyone forgot their charger for their phone.  First use the watch did sit right and never chargedSecond use it charged but seemed much weaker and took far longer to charge, was very picky on placement.Last while still plugged we kept hearing a high pitched electric noise that could only be heard by my daughters by the was (college/Highschool age).  The device was warm and seemed to be surging on and off.  I dont know if would have caught fire eventually, but either way I wont be using it for expensive apple watches.  Of course this happened outside the return window, so Im stuck just throwing it away.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn’t charge;It doesn’t charge my Apple Watch Ultra- even after turning off the optimization and setting an override for full charge. Left it on the charger overnight and it lost 3% in about 8 hours. Rubbish!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Inconsistent charges;It doesn’t seem to consistently charge my watch.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Carga lenta;Carga muy lento pero para emergencias está bien
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good for traveling;Very good for traveling, but it gets hot. I would only use for traveling not daily use.
3.0 out of 5 stars;It’s ok. Charges slow.;Eh, it’s ok. Doesn’t charge anywhere near as fast as a certified Apple brand charger.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not for Apple Watch Ultra;Will not charge the Apple Watch ultra. I’ve tried in multiple usb ports with varying power output. Overnight power just remains the same.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not wireless;Thought it was going to charge wireless, but it did not.It charges only when plugged, just w/o a cord attached.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Portable Watch Charger;Item as described and perfect for use in my car!!
2.0 out of 5 stars;**CAREFUL** You get what you pay for!;Just get the original Apple Watch charger for $13 more ($30 total). This charger looks awesome, but it will overheat your watch (as many reviews say) and then kill your battery so you’re charging your watch every day twice. I didn’t realize how bad it was until my new watch arrived and the battery lasted a few days. I’m returning this charger and I just ordered the original charger in the Apple Store. It’s a shame because it’s a great idea, but the technology inside is going to destroy your watch battery. Don’t be cheap like I was. Just get the original changer.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great when traveling;Charges quickly and very compact.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Piece of junk;This is definitely the worst iWatch charger I’ve ever had. It charges nothing, just a useless piece of junk.
5.0 out of 5 stars;A MUST have!;LOVE this.... perfect for my gaming keyboard AND it’s easy to unplug and GO!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good compact charger but very slow charging.;Great little compact charger but charging takes twice as long as the charger that came with the watch. The watch also gets hotter than normal on this charger. I have the WiFi version of the Series 5 Apple Watch.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Did not charge my watch.;This charger when I received it looked great. When I placed my watch on it to charge it appeared to start to charge. After ten mins I went back to look at my phone and my watch locked up and never charged. After letting my watch sit off the charger for a while it seemed to correct it’s self. I was nervous to try to charge my watch again adroit would mess my watch up permanently.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charge;Takes too long to charge. While convenient, it’s too slow. Would not recommend.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Apple Watch;Great for traveling or to put in purse or bag
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not magnetic enough;Charges yet not magnetic enough.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Disappointed;Great idea but has 2 major faults. One, as others have said, it takes way too long to charge. Two, it gets way too hot. I would not leave my watch on it for any extended length of time.I bought it to recharge my phone while I shower. It doesn’t charge it fast enough to get out of the red zone. Disappointing.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Pretty much a dud...;I was so excited to receive this based on the reviews, and it worked like a charm... For the first 3 weeks. Sadly, now it doesn't function properly at all. I put my Apple watch on it at 5% and 12 hours later when I checked it, it was only at 87% and felt very hot to the touch. Maybe mine was just defective? I don't know. I wish I was still in the return window because I would definitely request one. Buy at your own risk. Take care not to let it overheat and damage your watch.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Excess heating;Works well but gets very warm when charging.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not a wireless charger;I’m not sure what to say about this charger but nothing good.when I see wireless I assume it has a battery but no.Its wireless because you plug it directly into power but no wire is involved.Anyway very slow charging and is junk.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Takes too long to charge;It takes too long to charge and the watch is extremely hot. I will not be using this product, unfortunately I missed the return window.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Meh;It’s fine in a pinch. But charges super slow. It took forever to charge my watch
5.0 out of 5 stars;It’s great!;I love this! Super convenient!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Quality and practical;I love it.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Overheated and stopped charging;I used this product twice. The first time, it worked perfectly and charged my watch. I thought it was great and compact for traveling. The second time, it didn’t charge my watch at all, and instead overheated to the point where my watch was very hot and uncomfortable to touch. I’m not risking starting a house fire or ruining my watch for this product.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Didn’t work;Magnet didn’t line up right. Would not charge. Didn’t think to check it before my trip.Update: Newdery reached out with a warranty refund.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Read before buying;I thought it was a device that you can charge and store for later use. I just used it at work only, if I need a charge up
1.0 out of 5 stars;DO NOT BUY- drained my battery;I am not impressed with this charger. My Apple Watch got EXTREMELY hot after charging my watch for 30 minutes, I think it damaged the battery in my watch because now it doesn’t hold a charge like it used to. Do not buy this product!!!!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Charges too slowly;I bought this to have a conveniently sized Apple Watch charger when traveling. Although I did not expect this to be a fast charger like the one included with the watch, this charger works so slowly it’s not really worth the effort. Even after leaving it on the charger all night (8-10 hours) it had not even charged more than 10%.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Just right;Love this handy gadget
2.0 out of 5 stars;Small compact, but unreliable;Noce and compact for travel but stopped working after 7 months.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Does not hold charge;It takes long to charge and it turns on/off every few seconds.USB is in all the way and nothing is bumping or interfering with it to cause the unsteady charge. I’ve tried it in my car, laptop, and with a charging block.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn’t work very good.;Takes too long to change.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Charges... but SLOW;Works but it charges SLOW - great if you charge overnight but not if you want it done in an hour like the regular Apple Watch charger.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Never regret buying it;For traveling etc
2.0 out of 5 stars;I wanted to like this product BUT…;I really wanted to like this product for its features: slim, travel friendly and easy to use. Unfortunately the charge is weak compared to and authentic Apple Watch charger.  I will no longer be using.
3.0 out of 5 stars;charging issue;Unit gets hot, does not charge well
1.0 out of 5 stars;It has potential but does not work.;I was very excited when I received the item, but when I tried using it I got very frustrated. My watch wont stay connected on this charger, the magnetic is too weak. I hope they improve it with a new model.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Missing info;They should tell you that you need to install your own Apple Watch charger in the device to get that feature.
3.0 out of 5 stars;It fits in my handbag;It gets to hot when charging my watch.
1.0 out of 5 stars;This item does not charge the Apple Watch.;I like the look of the item. I dislike the performance because the Apple Watch does not get charged when using this product.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not a power bank;I thought this would be able to charge while traveling  Like portable phone chargers, not so. It requires being plugged into USB port all all times to charge. It would be good for an office but not travel
1.0 out of 5 stars;Do not buy. Does not work.;Product does not work says it all.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Would not buy again;So the magnet does not hold the watch if you have to plug the charger in this way as it shows in the picture. This is the 6 and it does not support the weight. You have to use it where the watch lays flat if you want to use this to charge your watch.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Died in less than a month;Worked for a few weeks - now only charges every so often. Totally unreliable.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good idea;Love it works well.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Charges slowly;It feels pretty cheap charges my watch very slowly. The contour of the charger doesn’t fit the back of the watch well (it’s not rounded enough) so the charger has to be horizontal so the weight of the watch holds it to the charger.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not a battery pack;I taught it was a battery pack, but it’s not you have to plug it into a port for it to charge the watch.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Travel charger;Works great, does get warm
1.0 out of 5 stars;This won’t even charge so it can’t even charge my watch. Don’t waste your money;Won’t even charge itself, don’t bother!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Takes awhile to charge;It wasn’t exactly what I was looking for and it seemed like it took a while for my Apple Watch to charge on this, quite long. Also not sure if it’s great for the battery life either- device would get really hot.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Watch gets hot when left on charger.;Design is nice holds watch well but only giving 2 starts because it made my watch extremely hot so I only use it when I can watch to see if it's charged and can remove it immediately. I wouldn't leave my watch on it again over night.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Works once, then just drains.;It worked great, ONCE. Then it just failed to charge. It drains the battery and gets super hot. I thought it was the watch, but when I place it on my own charger, it charges just fine. Don’t waste your time, or use at your own risk.
2.0 out of 5 stars;extremely slow;Nice small convenient, however it charges extra slow. It takes hours just to charge a third of the way. I bought 2 for 2 IPhones  series 4/44 watches. My watch was dead and it took forever to start back up with this charge.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Overheats;This product gets overheated super fast and it took more than 2 hours to only get from 5% battery to 40%
1.0 out of 5 stars;Didn’t work;Bought this for traveling and it didn’t charge my watch at all. Had to go to Walmart to get a new charger so I could use my watch on my trip.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Convenient;Very convenient but over heats watch when charging
3.0 out of 5 stars;If you can wait 3 hours;Wasn’t expecting such slow charging Time even from direct wall charger. No less than 3 hours.  Spend more for approved apple charger.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Works, but slow;Works to charge the watch. I like that I can plug it into my computer or usb in my car. Main problem is that it charges extremely slowly and needs to be on the charger for many hours
1.0 out of 5 stars;Why can’t it just work like it’s supposed to;"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I waited for this cause I needed a charger for my watch asap. Just got it today and it isn’t charging in anything. Got hot when I put it in the wall. Placed it on again and still nothing. I just want my watch charged. I’m not asking for much here. I don’t even feel like sending it back as Idk when I’ll get a proper one."
2.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charging;Good size, durable but sloooow at charging
2.0 out of 5 stars;Didn’t work for me…;I like that it’s small for traveling, however it does not keep your watch charging for long. I have tried plugging it into different USB ports as well, and no luck. I really wanted to use and love this product as it came recommended.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Terrible product!;Stopped working after 1 week of use.  Great concept, if it works!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesnt work. No charge.;Crappy product. I tried plugging this into the computer and into a wall charger and it didn’t charge my device on either.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Great at first but then stopped working right after the return period was closed.;I just bought this product June 1st 2021 and at first I loved it and it worked great. I loved the pink color and how small it is to pack for travel, but after a month and a half it is not working. It makes the watch super hot and after an hour or more on the charger, the battery completely drained. My watch has zero battery and I am worried it damaged it with how hot it got. When I went to return it I noticed I am just past the return date.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Hard to consistently keep charging.;Light weight and easy to travel. Takes a life time to charge and the magnet sometimes has a hard time syncing to charge. You’ll hear it make the sound of it charging a few times that you’ll have to keep repositioning it.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Worked for one charge..voltage info seems low;Worked great first charge. Now it charges suuuper slow. And it’s too small to use as a paper weight. So it’s just useless
1.0 out of 5 stars;Don’t work;This thing does not work
2.0 out of 5 stars;Does not charge;Seems to be a conviniéndote product but my Apple Watch doesn’t charge with this. Maybe I got a defective one but my watch will sit on this charger for 1 hr and only charge 5%
1.0 out of 5 stars;Will not charge;This charger would not completely charge my watch. It would get warm and simply stop charging. The company sent a replacement after complaining but the replacement was no different. When I inquired again for help. The reply was “sorry for your inconvenience “.  Very disappointing.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Failed to charge.;It did not charge my smartwatch so it was a wasted purchase.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Wrong Description;All descriptions claim this is a wireless charger. It is not. This is just a shorter wall/USB charger than your regular cord. You still have to plug it into something in order to charge the watch, which is completely opposite of what I want. I need a WIRELESS charger. Not a shorter one.
1.0 out of 5 stars;BEWARE DO NOT BUY;This totally fried my iwatch!!!!!! I had it plugged in and I came back an hour later and my watch was SUPER HOT and my watch never turned on again! I’ve tried everything and it’s totally fried !! Has not turned on since! I’m so sad! This company should pay for this!!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Don’t bother. Never charged past 91% even after 8 hours;well I was pretty disappointed as much as you could be for something that’s less than $10. I’ve used it five or six times and my watch was at 30 to 40% when I placed it on the charger after 6 to 8 hours the highest it charged was 91%. I tried switching out chargers to see if that would help went to an apple 5w to QI 2.0 12w. Didn't make a difference. And it was also very hot regardless of what charger I used. save your money and honestly probably just buy the OEM one.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Good for first 30 days;This product seemed to be the answer to all my needs for compact charger for Watch.  However the charger gets so HOT that it’s obviously not rightI wanted to return it, but now its past the return window.  Sits in the drawer. I don’t trust it not to damage my watch.As an update.  The customer support did contact me and offered to replace or refund my purchase.  The customer service team was professional and prompt. 10/21/2021.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Getting returned…;I had high hopes.  Plugged in my apple charger for my watch and right away the screen lit up with an charging indicator.  Then, switched to this product and…nothing….no indicator on my screen, nothing. Waited 10 minutes…still nothing.I don’t have time to wait to see ‘if’ it’s working or if I have a defect.  It’s going back. ‘Tis a shame.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Hopefully this is a rare lemon;I don't know if I got a lemon or what. Other reviews seem to be real good.. However mine takes forever to charge.. I leave it for hours and it charges very sliwly.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Device Gets hot when charging;I would use in a pinch but since it gets hot when charging afraid to use and damage watch.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn’t hold in place;Sometimes I left it on thinking it was charging that night and ended up disappointed in the morning seeing it wasn’t charged
2.0 out of 5 stars;Charges from computer only.;Product works well if plugged into usb of computer only. I tried several in wall charging hubs without success as well as the usb in my car.
1.0 out of 5 stars;FAIL;It failed. I charged the first day and it was fine. But every day thereafter it only charged 75%, then 50%, then 25% and yesterday 5%. FAIL. Do not buy this. I would return but I got the charger to travel and left the packaging behind. FAIL.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Didn’t work and fried my watching;After one charge my watch was fried. I put it back on my regular charger and it won’t work at all.
2.0 out of 5 stars;no good;product would work very very slowly, and sometimes wouldn’t charge at all, I had this in my car on an extended USB charger and it wouldn’t work. not very good
1.0 out of 5 stars;Charging issues;I have tried charging my Apple Watch 10 different nights and it only took charge 2 of those nights. When I picked my watch up off of the charger it was hot. The nights my watch didn’t charge it showed it was connected but the charging percentage never moved, the lighting bolt symbol is supposed to be green when charging but it stayed red. I dont know I have a bad unit, but if they are all like this don’t buy one!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Was pretty good when it worked;When I first received it, it worked fine.  Good charge and easy to use.  Stopped working just after the return window ended.  Money wasted.
1.0 out of 5 stars;charged 4 hours, got to 35% and HOT;Charger is ineffective. Returned it. Watch was super hot and didn’t charge even half after 4 hours securely on the charger.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Awful product;This charger worked great for the first five days. I am now currently charging my Apple Watch going on 2 1/2 hours and it’s only 50% charged. It is taking approximately four hours to charge which is totally unacceptable. Waste of money heads up!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not as good as it seems;Super convenient for traveling and small enough to store anywhere, but takes several hours to get a 20% charge.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not so good;This is a great concept but terrible product takes forever to charge my watch, and doesn’t work when I try to plug it into a wall plug.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Overheated my watch;I wanted to love this, I really did. I bought it to eliminate the charging cord and have a tidier charging option. The first night I used it my watch was overheated in the morning. Thankfully it cooled down and seems to be working fine but it is not worth risking frying your watch.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Does not charge;I liked the convenience of this, but unfortunately it doesn’t not work. It has only fully charged my watch a couple times.
1.0 out of 5 stars;It never worked.;I was received it broken. Never worked.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Very disappointed, takes forever to charge;I thought this was a great idea, but extremely disappointed. I charged my watch for four hours, only got to 70% and also became hot. I suppose if you planned to charge your watch overnight it would work, but I don’t want to do that. Not worth it to return it, but in my opinion not worth buying.
1.0 out of 5 stars;After using it for 8 months. it is dead, quietly.;After using it for 8 months. it is dead, quietly.
1.0 out of 5 stars;BROKE THE FIRST WEEK I HAD IT;FELL APART ALMOST IMMEDIATELY
1.0 out of 5 stars;Does not work!;Unfortunately I didn’t use the item in time to be able to return it. Now stuck with something that doesn’t work
1.0 out of 5 stars;Didn’t charge AND isn’t “portable”;Not only does This item not hold a charge. It’s literally just a charger that doesn’t have the convenience of having a cable to place it in a more convenient location. Very misleading. I was excited to have a way to charge my watch in my scrubs at work. To top it off I plugged it in and placed my watch on it and it literally never started charging. Totally worthless!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not worth the $;The concept behind this is awesome, reality a failure! Bought this thinking it would be super to have a charger to travel with. I left my charger at my daughters house so I had to use this one. I have used it three nights and not once did it charge more than half way even keeping it on through the night to charge. My regular charger chargers my watch fully in an hour.  I can not recommend buying.
2.0 out of 5 stars;This gets to be very hot.;Liked the design and stopper at the end.  But it gets to be too hot after charging.
1.0 out of 5 stars;doesn’t work;charged it maybe 5% in 5 hours - don’t waste your money
1.0 out of 5 stars;Great design, horrible execution;Love how this product looks and the intended use for it, but it doesn’t work as advertised. It won’t charge my Apple Watch at all. It gets too hot as well. It’ll show it’s charging but the battery doesn’t retain any of it. Have no issues with my normal Apple Watch wire so I know my watch isn’t the issue
2.0 out of 5 stars;Heats up;It is easy to use but would get hot super fast. Take long to charge as well. I would only use when emergency.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Got really hot but did not charge.;This didn't work it just heated up to an unsafe temperature the watch battery never budged a single percent after being on the charger for  3 hours.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not that great;It doesn’t work. It won’t charge on any outlet. It’s not worth the money
1.0 out of 5 stars;Charged less than 10% overnight;Barely partially charged my SE overnight.  Throwing away because I have no packing
1.0 out of 5 stars;This product does not work with my apple series 1;when i try to charge, it re-starts the charging every 10 seconds and does not even go above 35%. During the  charging process my watch's battery got drained instead. When i used my regular apple watch charger, everything was fine. I bought this to use during my vacation but i guess have to return it back!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not charging;This charger is not charging my watch. It’s losing power while on this thing.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Travel;Takes too long to charge
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not worthy;Cute small easy to throw in your bag. But unfortunately when charging your Apple Watch it gets too hot and doesn’t charge 100%. I would not recommend
2.0 out of 5 stars;Very slow charger, do not recommend;A very slow charger that takes hours more than the original Apple charger to get to a full charge.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Charging Issue;The charger worked great at first. And still charges now. however, it will randomly start and stop charging now during the middle of the night which then makes the screen of the watch light up illuminating the room.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped working after 2 months;This worked well for a few months and then stopped working completely. Went in the trash.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Too slow charging;I like that it’s portable but it takes too long to charge my iwatch .
1.0 out of 5 stars;Takes 8+ hours to charge;I bought this charger for traveling purposes and while its great for putting in a bag, the charger itself does not charge well at all. It took me over 9 hours to even get 75% on a charge. I used several outlets and charging bricks but had the same results. I would not recommend this product.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Heated watch and barely charged my watch.;Returned it. It would not work for traveling as I had hoped.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Piece of junk;Worked one time then nothing. Could be  I got a lemon but I don't think so, just a bad idea only working from a usb port. Very inconvenient to use and like I said lasted one charge then died. Buy at your own risk, but my guess is you will be returning it.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Constantly comes out of the USB port;Because it is constantly coming out of USB port, with no help from a human, my watch will stop charging and still be dead in the morning. Poor quality.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesnt work all the time;This worked fine when I plugged it into my laptop. But when I tried to use it in my car (which was my entire reason for purchasing this item) it didn’t charge my watch. I made sure it was connected properly and that my watch was magnetically attached but still no charge. Would not recommend.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't work;Not sure what is wrong with this charger. I was super excited after seeing several people online recommend it. I plugged it into a wall charger and put my watch on it and it wouldn't charge it at all. So I tried plugging it into a fully charged portable charger and put my watch on it....and the same thing. Super bummed :(
1.0 out of 5 stars;Failed after 8 months;The charger worked fairly well upon purchase (it charged at a slower rate versus Apple’s version), but the charge rate was okay. It got quite warm during charging but still worked - until it started to fail. Placing an Apple Watch on it now the charger activates and deactivates. Now the item is bonafide e-waste!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Useless and cheap;I successfully used this product twice. Both times with a device with multiple USB ports. It was slow but it charged. The third time I tried to use it, I plugged it into my power bank for over an hour and it hardly went up a percent or two. Then I tried plugging it in my car on the way to work, still nothing. Once I got to work I tried my laptop and a wall charger and still, nothing. It’s completely dead and useless after only two uses. Don’t waste your money!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Only Lasted 6 weeks;I bought this less than six weeks ago. Last night it stopped charging my Apple watch. Regular Apple charging cable charges watch fine.
2.0 out of 5 stars;I wanted to love this;Its the perfect size for travel, but it would not charge my watch past 20\30 %.  Returned for this reason.
1.0 out of 5 stars;doesn't work;mine doesn't work after 6 months. When it was working it would only change a few percent.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Very slow to charge.;Very slow to charge.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn’t work;Used it once and after that it didn’t work
1.0 out of 5 stars;I wish it worked;I really wanted to like this charge because of how compact and simple the design of it is, but it doesn’t charge up my Apple Watch. When sitting on the charger, the dead watch receives just enough power to light up the dead/charge now symbol. Maybe I got a dud? Idk, maybe it’s not truly comparable with my Apple Watch version, who knows what the problem is.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Crap;Did not like it threw it away
1.0 out of 5 stars;It didn’t work at all.;The idea was great. But sadly it didn’t work even once for me.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Pretty worthless;Made a mistake on this purchase. Bought two and neither one works.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Did not charge at all;I left my Apple Watch on this charger all night. I woke up to find that it hadn’t charged at all. The battery had actually drained to the point of being unable to turn on. The charging icon was on so it was attempting to charge, but overheating and not charging at all.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped charging after 1 use;Stopped working after charging one time.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Breaks after a few uses;Worked great for 2 charges and then it quit working completely
1.0 out of 5 stars;Stay away;This charger for my Apple Watch did not work at all. It overheated and actually drained the existing charge out of my watch. Just spend the money and get a good charger. Don’t buy anything that you can also find on WISH.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not bad;Gets really hot quickly. But, it is handy for a quick small kick of charge.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Junk.;Junk. Bought two. 1 worked for two months. The other never worked. Too late to return. Would have been great for purse, office, traveling.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Horrible product;Product does not work. I used multiple cubes from samsung, Apple, LG, etc and my watch doesn’t fully charge after 1 whole night plugged in. I’ve tried using it in my car and in the house and it doesn’t work. The normal Apple Watch charger works with the cubes mentioned earlier.
1.0 out of 5 stars;It didn’t work.;I bought this because it looked easy for travel but it didn’t charge my phone. Disappointed.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Just doesn't work;I have tried plugging this thing into every form of USB power and it just will not charge my watch.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Slowest charger I’ve ever had;Takes hours to get to 50%
1.0 out of 5 stars;Either I got a dud or it just sucks!;Not sure if I just got a dud or if it just sucks. Left my watch on it to charge, plugged directly into an Apple adapter for 1 hour and it barely charged it at all. Not worth the hassle to return, just gave it to a coworker and went back to using my corded charger.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Don’t waste your money;Stopped working a month after use of course too once return window closed.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Very slow charging.;Mine only charged 1% per hour. It takes 100 hrs. to get a full charge,
1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn’t work;I was really excited to have a simple little charger for my watch but it never worked. I had a fourth of the battery life on my watch and I put it on the charger for a couple hours and go back to look at it and my watch was dead. I’ve never had that problem before with any other charger. I do not recommend this product.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Room for Improvement;This charger could be great to have in a pinch, but I would not recommend as your main charger.  I wasn’t satisfied with the product due to the overall charging time. However customer service was absolutely excellent.  I believe they will improve their product in the future.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Makes my watch too hot during charging.;I had high hopes for this charger based on all of the positive reviews. It charges ok overnight, but my watch is super hot to touch the next morning. I even charged it without a band, but way too hot. I’m afraid it will damage the watch. Returned it.
1.0 out of 5 stars;It doesn’t charge it doesn’t do anything this is garbage to waste your money.;I try to stay away from doing reviews but this is only been a month I purchased it it worked I think the first two or three times and now it no longer works it doesn’t charge.It doesn’t charge it doesn’t do anything this is garbage to waste your money.
1.0 out of 5 stars;S-L-O-W;Impressive reviews led me to buy this charger.  I thought the lack of a long cord would allow it to charge quickly.  WRONG!  This charger is excruciatingly slow, requiring 2-3 hours to charge my Apple Watch.  What garbage!  Strongly advise that no one waste money on this.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Hot;Gets very hot when plugged in
5.0 out of 5 stars;Built tough;Heavy solid metal great for travel!!!!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Won’t charge right;Doesn’t work with apple very well… keeps going on & off & won’t charge.
1.0 out of 5 stars;NOT GOOD for in built-in USB ports in cars, etc.;I bought this to use in my car and in my office. Both places have built in USB ports. This charger is designed such that industry standard installation for USB A ports puts the watch on the underside of the charger, so there's not good contact with the watch, and it doesn't charge. It's going back. 😞
1.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped Working;Worked great and was very convenient to keep in my purse but completely stopped working after about 2 months and while I was on vacation and needed it. Disappointing!
1.0 out of 5 stars;DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM;Waste of money, instead of charging my watch it drained the battery. Plugged it in for 30min at 69% checked it and it was down to 54%. I tried charging again thinking maybe I didn’t place watch on charger correctly, but that was not the case, the charge dropped to 48% within minutes. Don’t waste your money.
2.0 out of 5 stars;No bueno 👎🏼;Difficult keeping the watch on it. It takes a lot of time to charge.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Good Concept, But Did Not Work for Me;Purchased to charge my Apple Watch 3 when I travel. The concept and design are good. Unfortunately, this device did not charge my Apple Watch. Placed my watch on the charger and it appeared to be charging. However, when I returned a few hours later, the charge level had actually gone down.
2.0 out of 5 stars;very slow, poor quality;charged my watch on it for 12hrs only went from 10% to 70%. not the best
1.0 out of 5 stars;Don't waste your money!;It doesn't work and takes probably 3 days to charge. After an evening of charging my watch, it went from 10% to 18% - and I'm talking a full 8-hour charge. It's terrible.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Too slow.;Extremely slow. I'd rather purchase the original apple watch charger.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Very slow charging;Terribly slow charging and cheap/weak construction

1.0 out of 5 stars;Not worth it;This worked poorly and didn’t charge my watch for most of my trip.  Sometimes I could get it to do a partial charge, but it was no reliable and it was too late to return it.  Don’t waste your money.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Very slow charging;This charger takes way too long to charge Apple Watch
1.0 out of 5 stars;Waste of money;Total waste of money. It looked like it was charging then by morning my watch was dead and both the watch and charger were hot. Spend the money and get a real Apple Watch charger.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Charges Slow;Beautiful device....charges much slower than regular chargers.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Wish it worked;I loved the idea of this and always having a charge on hand for my Apple Watch but unfortunately it doesn’t work at all. It doesn’t charge my watch but does get extremely hot

1.0 out of 5 stars;Product over heated my iwatch and has caused me to have apple replace it.;Bad product. It over heated my new Iwatch and caused electrical damage. Watch has to be replaced.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Trash---ridiculously slow charge if at all.;Don't waste your dough. This product is nonsense. if you get 1% an hour you are lucky. Read even the 4 and 5 stars reviews--- they tell you the same thing they just do not care apparently.

1.0 out of 5 stars;Almost Useless;Convenient form-factor and size. Would be great for travel. Charges slow when it works, which is almost never. I bought 3 at the same time - they're all the same: almost useless. Save your money and buy something else.

1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't work with my Apple watch;Over the past week I might had it fully charge one time using multiple usb outlets. They all start off charging but then the watch gets overheated and does not changer. Buyer Beware!! Yes I'm sending this item back.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Did not work for me;I tried it on my Laptop as well as plugged it into a socket.  Both times made my watch really hot and even lost 1% charge on the watch.  I am returning it.  Do not recommend.
1.0 out of 5 stars;They will bribe you to delete negative reviews!!!;Charges series 2 Apple watch no problem, but series 6 is very flaky.

1.0 out of 5 stars;You get what you pay for!! Buy cheap Get CHEAP!!!;Bought for charging watch at work, when I forgot to use the Apple charger. Garbage!! 4 hours and it was barely half power. In my opinion a waste of time and worst waste of money!!

 Easy to use and works well.Five stars except for one issue - I bought one of these a few months ago and the USB connector on the charger (white in the picture) was bidirectional. it could be installed with the charging surface either up or down to suit your charging needs. The new chargers (blue in the picture) can only be installed in one orientation. See video"
4.0 out of 5 stars;Compact;Please be advised that this product does serve a fairly specific niche:  It's a compact Apple Watch charger and it's about as small as you can get with this particular device.  As such placing it somewhere where you can use it properly can be a bit challenging, I found in my case that the  watch band itself has enough natural curl to be problematic with this.  It's not the fault of the design of this product, its the reality of using it.  Just for grins I've been using it as my daily charger and maybe 1 in 10 times the watch slides off it and fails to charge.  However after a couple of failures I've learned how to do it in a way that's pretty reliable.  The biggest challenge for me was finding a USB port that's low to a flat surface.  In my case that'd be a desklamp I have that has a USB port right in the base.So, in short:  If you need a daily charger for your Apple Watch, it is VERY difficult for me to recommend it because it sacrifices a couple of niceties to get you a more compact charger.  If you're a business traveller trying to shrink your carry-on bag, I can't recommend this enough.
4.0 out of 5 stars;A great way to keep the apple watch charged on the go;This USB travel Apple Watch charger from Newdery is a convenient to top up your Apple Watch on the go.The footprint of this charger is small but the magnet is strong enough to keep the Apple Watch in place. I typically plug mine into an open USB port on my computer and it charges sufficiently fast enough that I can't complain too much about it. It's noticeably slower when I use a laptop vs a desktop but it charges on both.What I don't like about this charger is that it seems stressed when I charge the watch still inside its band. Granted I use aftermarket Apple Watch bands and maybe some of them are heavier than the official one that ships with the watch. Still, a few ounces shouldn't make that much of a difference but it does. Also, as mentioned earlier, this charger does best when plugged into a desktop PC. Laptop charging (should be noted that I have a windows machine not a MacBook) is appreciably slower for me.Overall, I like the convenience of this charger from Newdery. It's easy to carry, effectively chargers the Apple Watch given the right power source and it's magnet has enough attraction to keep the watch secure.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works Fine for Most Users Travelling Needs;I have not used the charger for travelling. Instead, it stays plugged into my desktop and that is where I use it. It may be compact for travelling but I find it bulky at my desktop and may go back to what I used before: a USB charging cable specific for apple watches. I think the strap is a bit questionable if it is intended for a key chain. Not sure about how sturdy the little leather piece is? However, for my purposes, I find it a bit cumbersome to stick out of my USB port but would use it in my car.
4.0 out of 5 stars;It cracked :( !;This charger is perfect to keep in my handbag in case the watch runs low.  The item charge the watch pretty quickly and i was very happy with it until it cracked.  The charger was in my handbag in a cosmetic bag any well cushioned. I don’t know how it could crack so easily. While the devices does slowly charge the watch (even cracked) its not worth it to risk the battery on the watch.  I will order another to replace the cracked one as it is helpful to have a portable Apple Watch charger!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Most convenient Apple Watch travel charger I own!;I finally got the chance to use this Apple Watch charger, and it is amazing! I used it with a standard Apple USB charging brick in a traditional vertical electrical receptacle (i.e. outlet), and it worked just as expected with my Apple Watch Series 3...perfect!I LOVE that it does not require any cords, but plugs straight into the USB port. While I have yet to use this with a computer USB port, I am certain it would function just as well. This is a really compact and convenient way to charge an Apple Watch. I highly recommend it!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Completely useless - initially charged a little and then it is making the watch HOT;DO NOT RECOMMEND! It doesn't charge. PERIOD. Cheap circuitry.Initially seemed like it was just very very slow - but I would come home and charge on the regular charger. When I tried to charge ONLY on this to see how long it will take to charge to green, I found out it is not doing a thing. It won't be efficient use to carry along if it doesn't charge like regular charger. Even after several hours the watch just got HOT and stayed on RED,  not charged.
1.0 out of 5 stars;This is a POS.;The connection with the watch is so sensitive that you can't use this in the car or anywhere there are virations.  The Apple cable is the only way to go.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Gets hot and charges slow;I got this as a christmas and and tried to use to charge my apple watch which was dead. All it did was overheat my watch and was never able to gain a charge.If i wanted to use for travel i would rather have the wires and get somewhat of a faster charge as this product didnt work at all.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Worked well at first, now it's a dud;It worked well for the first 6 months. But now it just seems to over heat and give very little to no charge.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not worth wasting your money on!;Doesn’t work at all it kills your battery instead of charging it do not recommend buying it!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Trash;Straight trash. It keeps the watch from going dead but doesn’t charge it. Had to use another one to charge the watch
4.0 out of 5 stars;It gets hot;The media could not be loaded.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Love this magnetic charger!;This is a favorite purchase for charging my watch. I don’t travel much but have specific places I like to charge my watch. I love that this plugs in and you can place your watch right on the magnetic charger with no wires laying all over my counter. Am going to order more!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Smallest apple watch charger.;This is a good apple watch charger. Although it wont charge as fast a OEM charger it is great for travel as I hate carrying a bunch of cords with me for charging. This product is very small so I wouldn't suggest dropping it due to its size but it feels durable.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Charging takes time;Charger was easy to use and perfect for travel. My original apple watch charging cable is hooked up to a charging stand so its a pain to remove it from the stand for travel purposes. This charger is easy to put in travel cable bags and works well with wireless power banks. Downside is that it takes a longer time to charge my watch as opposed to the original charging cable but will still be fully charged if you I it on the charger overnight. Overall great buy and currently in use on my travels throughout the midwest.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Best investment ever;I got this for my college kid and he travels a lot  got a couple for the car n travel comes in handy when you’re in a pinch and your watch is on low battery best investment ever!!!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect for traveling;This little thing is perfect tot have in the car to add an little extra charge to your watch while you’re sitting. The only thing I would say to be careful to look at is the space above and around the charging port because you are putting a watch on top of the charger that can easily not fit or get knocked off if it’s a tight fit
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not working;Purchased multiple. Half didn’t work. Didn’t bother returning but glad I checked all since they were going to be stocking stuffer presents for Christmas
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works Great;This charger works great and it so convenient.  Easily fits with my other portable chargers.  I keep it with my travel items.

2.0 out of 5 stars;Rather charge at home;Convenient but trouble some. Took forever to charge n didn’t grip the Apple Watch. Kept falling off
5.0 out of 5 stars;Must buy;Love this little gadget to carry with you when you are traveling instead of the actual apple charger. Very convenient to use and the price is great as well
4.0 out of 5 stars;Decent charger;Update: I tried it with a different base and it works much better I am no longer regretting this purchase. It works just fine now but it does get warm to the touch occasionally.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Seems good so far;Seems good so far. small, has a cover, works, good price
2.0 out of 5 stars;Carga lento;Buena presentación, buen acabado... pero la carga del Apple Watch es lenta.
2.0 out of 5 stars;So it gets the job done;It chargers my Apple Watch SUPER slow but eventually gets the job done. It’s small enough to throw in my purse for emergencies. Not in love with it but don’t hate it either....
1.0 out of 5 stars;Crappy charger;The item will not charge my Apple Watch. I charged it all night, still no charge. I tried with different charges. I waited 8 days to late to return.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Love it!;Seriously love this! Having this to take Instead of my OG one, fav on the go product!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great for travel;Replacing a cord charger. This was fast, easy to pack.  Very pleased
5.0 out of 5 stars;It charges the watch quickly 💥and it stays on great.;Makes travel easy. Use it at cabin because it is easier to store.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Runs hot;When plugged in it tune hot.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect for on the go;I carry it on my keychain since I always forget to charge my watch at home. Works perfect and it's a life saver when working long hours
5.0 out of 5 stars;Compact and easy to travel with;I love how small it is just fits in my bag without taking up a lot of space. The only downside to the charger is the takes a long time to charge the watch.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Necessary;If you have won Apple Watch or AirTag this charger is necessary. My watch says midway through the day so I charge it often. I keep this in my bag for charging on the go. It’s magnetic so you can charge horizontally or vertically. You just need a ISB port
5.0 out of 5 stars;Charges quickly;Charges quickly and convenience
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good price;It is a good price Apple Watch charger.Charged my watch only 25% after an hour of driving. For some reason it will not stay attached to the USB port and I have to keep pushing it in to make sure stays in and charging…
5.0 out of 5 stars;Awesomeness;Love it so far no issues.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not for charging in a car;I bought this to charge my watch while driving.  Unfortunately, it is oriented horizontally and the USB port is oriented vertically, which makes that impossible. My bad for not noticing this before buying. It would probably work with a laptop port.
2.0 out of 5 stars;If it worked I'd like it;So yeah this is trash. It doesn't charge but for 5 mins. When you put your watch on this it takes a minute before its recognized but even after it finds it it only charges for five to ten minutes before it is no longer connected. The image you see is one of the multiple ports I have connected the device to. From my computer to an actual plug cube to the device meant to charge Apple devices. Same issue every time. I'm legit upset but I guess it is what it is. I just want my watch charged when I forget to take it off at night and not die when I'm out. Smh
3.0 out of 5 stars;Only works while being charged;This item will not charge your watch unless it is powered into your computer or a charging bank.This is something that folks need to know.  I almost returned it until my daughter figured out that this little device must be charging itself while charging your watch.  It doesn't charge your apple watch independently and on it's own.  It needs power one way or the other to charge your watch.  This info ought to be displayed on the specifications or product information page, but it is not!
1.0 out of 5 stars;A charger that drains battery? No thanks!;This charger depletes my battery instead of charging my watch. Went from 40% to 10% in half hr
4.0 out of 5 stars;It Works... Slowly;This is a pretty cool gadget, it works but man is it slow. Only way you'll be able to fully charge your watch is if you do it overnight. Don't buy it to get a fast charge cause you'll be disappointed. I'd say to charge 50% takes about 6 - 7 hours. Works in a pinch for sure though.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Don’t recommend;Doesn’t work very wellI don’t recommend
5.0 out of 5 stars;Lightweight and compact it is too;I've had my portable wireless chargers for a little while now and I'm still just as impressed with them as I was when I first got them! It's been super reliable and charges my Apple Watch really quickly - I can get a full charge in just 2-3 hours which is great. I really like how lightweight and compact it is too - it's perfect for taking with me when I travel and means I don't have to worry about bringing a big and bulky charger with me. The cableless design is also great as it means I don't have to deal with tangled cables - it's just so much more convenient. Overall, I'm really happy with this charger and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a great wireless charger for their Apple Watch.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect for traveling;Haven’t used it just yet but if it fully works I can’t wait to use it on the go. It’s so much easier than carrying the long cord and the outlet.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charging;Wouldn’t but again, this is very slow charging. Would buy again
3.0 out of 5 stars;Hot;Love the size and portability of this charger for my iphone watch.  My only complaint is that it gets my watch really HOT while charging.  Passed the return window so hopefully this will last for another trip.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Charges slower than normal, but compact and easy to use;I broke my USB-C fast charger so I'm left with the longer USB-A and this charger.This charges slower than the Apple OEM USB charger, but still works okay...The vertical charging on this is a little finicky to get just right, but once setup, it holds and charges just fine.This is a must for my compact travel charging kit.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Works but not the fastest.;Unit charges kinda slow even on iQ charger and also poops it’s self out of the plug.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Best Travel hack;Hi! Yes I got this item so have use it while traveling or even in my car when I forget to charge my Apple Watch. It’s awesome I throw it in my purse and I I need it I plug it in the power cord and done.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Access On Hand;Great little item to always have on hand.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great charger for on the go;Perfect.
5.0 out of 5 stars;This is perfect for traveling.;I do not like to take my expensive Apple Watch charger when I travel so this is perfect.  It is not as fast as the original charger, but I charge my watch at night so not a problem!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Pratico e perfetto per le emergenze;Per il prezzo pagato va benissimo. Non é velocissimo nella ricarica ma va bene per emergenze. Io l'ho comprato per tenerlo in ufficio e lo attacco alla porta USB del PC.  Ha anche il laccetto per attaccarlo al portachiavi.

4.0 out of 5 stars;iWatch charger;Arrived on time. Bought it because I keep forgetting to charge my iwatch sufficiently. I’m keeping it with my emergency battery phone charger and it works. Will get back when I’ve used it enough.
4.0 out of 5 stars;bon produit;bon produit mais ca ne charge pas tres vite sur le port usb d'un pc portable ce qui est normal la puissance du port usb est faible
3.0 out of 5 stars;Xmas Gift;Great for charging when plugged into to laptop however will not plug in to my travel plugs or the Apple plug the correct way round so unable to charge my watch - disappointed
4.0 out of 5 stars;Charges slowly, which can be good or bad.;This charger is only 2W, so it charges very slowly compared to the 7.5W USB C fast chargers included with newer watches. In my case that’s actually something I’m happy with, since I only really use this overnight with battery packs and slower charging should mean less power wasted as heat. Other reviews mentioned the watch getting hot while charging, which I haven’t noticed yet on my unit. Based on the one I received, I’m glad I took a chance on this charger since it’s been a great addition when camping - leaves a tiny bit more charge in the battery for the phones, and it still gets the watch to 100% before I wake up. That being said, most people will probably care far more about the charging speed than the efficiency and if that’s the case for you, you should definitely buy a different one.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good product. Does the job as expected;I use it to charge my Apple watch. I usually use it with the wall charger it charging is decently quick. I haven' t tried it with the laptop USB ports. Happy with the product.

 I had a goodman’s apple watch charger that didn’t work or charge my Apple Watch and I was looking for something small and effective and not costly. I liked the device the only thing I found awkward was it had to charge flat or the watch will drop, if you charge it directly from the socket, you’ll probably need an extension lead then you can charge it flat other than that works ok does the job great for travelling or a temporary charger if you decide to get the official Apple Watch charger at a later date"
4.0 out of 5 stars;Finalmente un prodotto piccolo pratico e che funziona!;Stavo cercando da tempo una soluzione che non fosse il classico caricatore con filo e prolunga USB. Questo è compatto e ha incluso un piccolo cappuccio di gomma per evitare sporco e urti.molto pratico se utilizzato con prese orizzontali, se l’attacco USB è in verticale specialmente con un cinturino metallico come il mio un po’ pesante fatica a restare magnificamente attaccato alla casa dell’orologio… Non è mai caduto, ma per precauzione serro il cinturino quando lo carico.Tutto sommato in termini di  qualità/prezzo , lo ritengo un ottimo prodotto
3.0 out of 5 stars;Leider sehr langsam;Ich hab schon eine langsame Ladeleistung erwartet, aber leider was er bei dem Dongle noch langsamer und somit für mich unbrauchbar
3.0 out of 5 stars;Comodo ma..;Dunque è davvero molto comodo ma se la presa che avete ha l’uscita usb verticale come la mia occhio perché potrebbe darvi problemi con la carica, nel senso che non prende bene il magnete di apple watch.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Mine needs a QC supply to work.;The one I’ve just bought works, but only when connected to a QC power supply. On a 2.4 W port it won’t charge my series 6 Apple Watch. As long as I make sure the watch is snug against the charger - in my case by keeping the elastic strap on and putting a toothpaste tube box under the charger with the watch band around them both - then the watch doesn't overheat while charging
3.0 out of 5 stars;Bel design, solo un bel design;Articolo piacevole alla vista. Peccato che dopo un minuto di accensione raggiunge una temperatura così alta da mettere a rischio il costoso Apple Watch
3.0 out of 5 stars;Charging OK, but it does not stop when the watch is full - the watch keeps beeping every minute;Small charger for the Apple Watch. Works well, but it cannot be used for overnight chargin. The watch beeps every minute or so, because obviously the chargin process is not automatically stopped when the watch is full.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Génial;Pratique, simple et discret. Contente de mon achat. A voir dans le temps

2.0 out of 5 stars;Unreliable;I was looking for a charger for an Apple Watch Series 6 that is portable enough to carry around in my everyday bag, preferably with no cables involved. In general, I wouldn't have considered a charger that is not MFI-certified but I decided to give this one a go, as it costs 1/3 of the price compared with other brands, and there are a swarm of reviews complimenting this charger. I've tried to keep my expectations low, as I knew that it would be a slow charger (it is mentioned repeatedly in most of the reviews). However, many other issues made me quit on this one:1. the magnet was not strong enough and as a result, I could charge the Apple Watch safely only if the charging side was in a horizontal position looking upwards. if I was using a USB power adapter that would position the charging side vertically or in a horizontal position with the charging side looking sideways, the Apple Watch can start slipping and it was susceptible to displacement even in light vibrations.  The rubber cap did help in certain situations, but again, it was far from ideal to expect your £400+ Apple watch to stay in position because of a rubber cap.2. The charger tends to warm up and made me concerned about the safety of the sensors of the Apple Watch.3. The charge seems to slow down and would stop when it would reach around 75%. Not sure why, if that was because I was impatient and didn't give it extra time to finish the charging or it was some issue with the specific charger. In any case, considering that took more than 2 hours each time to get from 10-15%  to 75% of charge, that was not particularly helpful.In any case, it still works and does it's job, sort of, and it is very portable. Personally, however, I've decided to bite the bullet and get an MFI-certified charger.

4.0 out of 5 stars;Valida alternativa;Rispetto all’originale la potenza di ricarica è un po’ bassa e ci mette a ricaricare
2.0 out of 5 stars;Lädt quasi nicht.;Das Ladegerät lädt die AppleWatches zwar auf, bei der Series1 ca. 1% in 20 min, und bei der Series6 ca. 1% in 15 min. Aber leider auch nur sofern die Uhren nich nicht im StandBy sind. Sind die Uhren erst einmal leer schafft der Adapter es nicht sie so zu laden das sie angehen. Sie werden zwar warm/heiß aber das war es auch schon. Getestet ab 5v und 10v. Also quasi nutzlos. Schade

3.0 out of 5 stars;Nicht Fisch, nicht Fleisch, mit guten Ansätzen aber auch eklatanten Mängeln...;"Die Bewertungen reichen ja von super bis mies, daher habe ich es einfach mal getestet und komme zu folgendem Ergebnis im Einsatz mit meiner Apple Watch SE und diversen Ladegeräten und Kabeln:- Drehbarer Anschluss (okay, nicht drehbar, aber um 180 Grad gedreht trotzdem einsteckbar) ermöglicht Einsatz an jeder horizontalen USB-Buchse in PC, Laptop, Powerbank etc.- Gleichzeitig der Nachteil, vertikale Buchsen sind nicht nutzbar. Niemals nicht, nein, es geht WIRKLICH nicht ! (außer man nimmt ein Kabel dazwischen, macht das Teil aber sinnlos, das kann der Apple-Adapter ja auch)- Uhr liegend auf dem Magnetteller klappt prima, lädt ordentlich wenn auch LANGSAMER als das Orignal (wer da gegenrechnet dass es gleichschnell geht, wie soll das gehen bei weniger Output in Watt ????)- Uhr aufrecht bei Einsatz auf der Oberseite eines Ladegerätes das in einer Steckdosenleiste auf dem Tisch steckt: GEHT NICHT !Hersteller hat hier tolle Erfindung mit der Gummikappe gemacht die als ""Stabilisator"" herhalten soll, aber völlig versagt einen Magneten einzubauen der ne SE-Watch halten kann.Sie rutscht, sie fällt, EGAL wie herum sie angelehnt wird und ob das Armband auf oder zu ist...Dem kann man nicht vertrauen und ne Apple Watch auf dem Boden ?  Nein !  Erfindung gut gedacht, Umsetzung ""Sechs - Setzen"".- Erwärmung ist höher als beim Original, wenn auch marginal.Wird nicht ""heiß"" und brennt auch nicht, lädt auch durchgehend ohne auszusetzen, aber hey, an einer Laptop-USB-Buchse mit eh nur wenig Ladestrom würde ich es nicht testen.Ich habe den Adapter nun meistens an einer Powerbank (ja, die sind i.d.R. liegend und die Buchse daher horizintal), das klappt prima und bietet die Möglichkeit unterwegs mal ein paar Prozent Akkuladung nachzuschieben.Für den täglichen Gebrauch oder als Haupt-Ladeadapter aber nicht zu empfehlen. Dann lieber den doppelten Preis für's doppelte Vergnügen und eine Uhr, die niemals runterfällt (Apples Mag hält auch eine Watch SE über Kopf fest .-)  )Mal sehen ob das Teil die 30 Tage Rückgabefrist übersteht...."

5.0 out of 5 stars;Great;Bought this to leave in my car (which has a couple of USB sockets) in case I need to charge my watch on the move. and this is perfect. It's small enough to fit in my pretty full glove box in case I need it.

5.0 out of 5 stars;Nifty little charger;I bought this as a handy charger to keep in my car for stays away from home so I don’t risk losing my 2m Apple charger. I got the light pink and it’s a gorgeous colour.The charger works really well. I can’t really comment on the speed as I charge my watch overnight, but it definitely fully charged my device in that time.The magnet is fairly strong and the watch can be charged on its side and it will still stay put, especially due to the handy shelf created by the usb cap.I would definitely recommend as a travel charger that takes up barely any space.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Batería;Muy practico para el día a día que se descarga el reloj…
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not great but charges;Firstly I bought this as it was small, matches my phone & watch colour.I had reservations about the magnet strength for charging anglesBut the add gives assurance that there is a good connection.There is not, it charges and stays if you plug the usb into say a laptop, but anything over 45 degrees in any direction and the watch will fall off.And it does get hotter than apple chargers.Does it hold magnetically? No (gravity prevails)Is it easy to use? Yes plug & play (if horizontal)Does it charge? YesDoes it get hot? YesDoes the watch get hot? Yes

Empieza a cargar y al minuto para, espera unos segundos y vuelve a empezar a cargar.Una pena porque la idea es buena y el cargador esta bien, pero luego no funciona bien.

2.0 out of 5 stars;Watch gets extremely hot!;Although the design of this charger is great (perfect for traveling) and it charges my watch quickly my watch gets so hot in the process that after three uses it’s going in the bin!Update August 2022: I have been contacted daily for the last week by a person asking me to take down my review on the promise of a £50 gift card. They have tried to use guilt by claiming my review will cause their company to go bankrupt leaving them unable to feed their children. Really disappointed that this kind of harassment is allowed for a genuine review of a substandard product.

5.0 out of 5 stars;Klein aber wirklich oho;Endlich ein Ladegerät für meine Apple Watch, das man locker in der Tasche mitführen kann das und überall funktioniert. Falls man einen Laptop besitzt, kann man es direkt an die USB Buchse anschließen, falls man einen richtigen Rechner besitzt (als ein MacBook & Co.) steckt man das Teil an einen USB-Adapter .-)Hat man einen mobilen Akku, dann daran. Möglichkeiten gibt es viele und man spart sich das teure Apple-Ladekabel als Zweitgerät für Urlaub und Dienstreise. Die Ladedauer ist meiner Meinung nach identisch zum Original mit Stecker. Für die paar Euro eine eindeutige Empfehlung.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Scarso;L’idea non è male e mi aveva tratto per la sua semplicità.il risultato è il seguente: ho inserito il mio Apple Watch completamente scarico e ho trovato in primo luogo una certa difficoltà a far sì che attaccasse nel modo giusto. Dopo alcuni tentativi, l’Apple Watch si è finalmente messo nella posizione corretta ed è partita la carica, visibile dal quadrante dell’orologio. Dopo una notte intera in carica la mattina mi sono ritrovato il telefono a meno del 25% di carica. Possiamo quindi dire che se vi aspettate un device di emergenza, in grado di mantenere in vita la carica del vostro Smart Watch in modo da non rimanere a zero, potrebbe anche essere utile. Se vi aspettate un’alternativa al vero caricatore, assolutamente no! Diciamo che la difficoltà nel trovare il setup iniziale (mi aspettavo che bastasse poggiarlo come su qualunque caricatore) e la estrema lentezza ne decretano senza appello un giudizio di oggettiva scarsità
4.0 out of 5 stars;Se adapta bien, carga bien, comodo.;De momento todo bien con el, es cómodo, depende donde lo pongas a cargar sea fuente de luz o pc tarda mas o menos, compra correcta.

Usato caricabatterie funziona davvero benissimo, è comodissimo da tenere sempre in borsa, e carica quasi alla stessa velocità di quello originale. L’unica accortezza da avere è di utilizzarlo tenendolo piatto, in modo da poter appoggiare l’iWatch in orizzontale (perché in verticale non mantiene abbastanza a lungo il contatto). Acquisto decisamente consigliato.

3.0 out of 5 stars;Nettes Teil für unterwegs oder im Büro;Habe erst einmal die Watch 5 damit geladen. Dies hat gut funktioniert, mir fiel jedoch auf, dass das Ladegerät deutlich wärmer wird als das originale Ladegerät. Deshalb habe ich auch einen Stern abgezogen.Ich werde weiterhin mit dem originalen Zubehör laden und dieses wirklich nur wenn mal not am Mann ist verwenden. Der Preis ist aber ok für mich. Nachtrag - nachdem ich es jetzt zwei- drei Mal benutzt habe, habe mich entschlossen den Wireless Charger zurück zu senden. Die Uhr wird extrem heiß. Das kann nicht gut sein für die Watch.

4.0 out of 5 stars;Good product solves the purpose;Na
2.0 out of 5 stars;Overheats the watch;Well, this one works better than the similar UGreen one I tried and returned.  It actually charges my watch - at a slow but acceptable rate (around 0.5% per minute, or c3hr for a full charge). That's about 1/3 the charging speed of a genuine Apple charger, but ok for overnight charging.  BUT it makes my watch very hot - to the point where it is uncomfortable to put on immediately.  I can't think this is good for the watch or the battery life of the watch, and as the watch costs an awful lot more than I am saving with this device, I don't want to risk it.  So, returned and buying the 0.3m genuine Apple lead for £29 (twice the price).  Shame, as the format is perfect for me.
3.0 out of 5 stars;boh.;poco pratico.l'orologio non sta attaccato bene e si sposta continuamente, in più di un'occasione ritrovi l'orologio un poco spostato e la ricarica interrotta.Dipende sia dal fatto che il magnete è debole, sia dal fatto che i ragazzi di Cupertino hanno pensato la parte inferiore dell'orologetto come una sfera e questo facilita qualsiasi spostamento.con un magnete più forte sarebbe promosso.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Malo;Malo
1.0 out of 5 stars;Super langsames Laden;Ich kaufte dies, um auf Reisen ein Apple Watch Ladegerät in bequemer Größe zu haben. Obwohl ich nicht erwartet hatte, dass dies ein Schnellladegerät wie das der Apple Watch beiliegende ist, arbeitet dieses Ladegerät so langsam, dass es die Mühe nicht wirklich wert ist. Selbst nachdem es die ganze Nacht (8 - 10 Stunden) am Ladegerät gelassen wurde, hatte es nicht einmal mehr als 20% aufgeladen.Update: Nach anderthalb Monaten ist das Produkt komplett tot.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Handliches Ladegerät für Apple Watch;Plus: Das Ladegerät ist handlich, passt sogar in die Hosentasche und ist gut auf Reisen einsetzbar.Minus: Ladedauer ist zu lang. Eine vollständige Ladung erfolgt nicht immer und die Mitnahme von einem Netzteil ist u. U. nötig.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Praktisches Ladegerät, aber langsamer und wärmer!;Allem voran: das Ladegerät ist natürlich super praktisch, da kein Kabel erforderlich ist, welches auch nicht kaputt gehen kann oder sich verheddert. komischerweise wird das Ladegerät aber immer sehr heiß und wärmt dadurch auch die Uhr, was mir ein wenig Unbehagen bereitet. Gleichzeitig lädt es die Uhr nach meinem subjektiven empfinden langsamer als das Original – Ladegerät.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Not the fastest but it works.;The magnet isn't very strong either, but it keeps the watch in place.  I once had to awkwardly put the watch on the charger upside down, i.e. against gravity, and it was held in place, but a small bump against it made it drop.But hey, it's cheap and gets it done.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Seems to be very slow at charging.;I'm not sure what these other reviewers are reviewing here but this device took forever to even get a couple of percent of charge into my watch.  Ridiculously slow.  Maybe good for an overnight charge, but if you were wanting a quick boost of charge to keep you going this device is not going to do it.

2.0 out of 5 stars;Decepcionante;Debido a su conector USB y a ser rígido depende mucho de la posición del enchufe, para que pueda ser más o menos cómoda su carga.Tarda bastante en cargar, y eso que lo uso con un adaptador de carga rápida, y da continuos pitidos el  porque pierde la carga, es decir la carga es intermitente. Lo cual es especialmente incómodo cuando estás durmiendo ya que suena la campana de que has dejado de cargar cada pocos minutos

3.0 out of 5 stars;Nicht für Apple-Tastatur!!!;Produkt ist gut verarbeitet, lädt die Uhr wie gewünscht und hat mit dem kleinen Bändchen auch noch einen gewissen Chic. Da ich es immer in einer Kleinteiletüte habe, um es mit auf Geschäftsreisen zu nehmen, kommt mir die Schutzkappe für den USB Anschluss sehr gelegen, zumal sie eine Verliersicherung hat. Warum trotzdem nur drei Sterne? Die Appletastaturen haben zwei USB Ports, um z.B. solche Ladeaccessoires zu verbinden. Wenn ich dieses Gadget darein stecke, würde es zwar funktionieren, aber die Uhr kann ich nicht mehr drauflegen, siehe Bild.

3.0 out of 5 stars;Very slow charge.;As a portable device for charging your watch underway, this product is ok. It charges at a ridiculously slow rate. It is, however, a much more portable charger than a meter of cable.You can plug it into the hotel TV, powerpack, or other random USB socket that you can find, and the watch will „glue“ itself to it.Ok for underways, but not a replacement for the original charger.

1.0 out of 5 stars;Articulo pésimo;Compré este articulo y en el mismo dia lo devolvi. Mientras cargaba el reloj se puso a una temperatura exagerada, pensé que se fundiria por la temperatura que había cogido. Para mi es un articulo mal fabricado y peligroso. No lo recomiendo para nada.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Unreliable;This device did not charge my watch. It stops charging after a few minutes. I took this camping this weekend with both car charger USB, VW camper 2amp USB and resorted to 5amp power bank to try and get it to charge. It actually lost charge overnight rendering my watch useless for the days hiking. Very very disappointed and will not be able to use it for intended purposes…or any useful purpose. Wast of money.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Watch is getting hot during charging;THE watch is getting more hot than when it is charged on the original pad from Apple.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Praktisch für die Arbeit;Ich hab mir das Teil gekauft, um meine Uhr auf Arbeit laden zu können. Prinzipiell finde ich es ganz praktisch, dass klein und handlich ist.Abzüge gibt es aber dafür, dass der Deckel nicht durchgängig ist und damit im Rucksack Dreck in den Anschluss kommen kann. Dazu habe ich das Gefühl, dass die Uhr sehr langsam lädtDazu werden Uhr und Ladegerät nach kurzer Zeit sehr warm.
3.0 out of 5 stars;USB Ladegerät für Aple Watch;USB Ladegerät lädt sehr sehr langsam weiss nicht ob das normal ist oder so gehört aber sollte das normal sein kommt von mir keine Kaufempfehlung
4.0 out of 5 stars;Practico;Es práctico y carga perfectamente,
2.0 out of 5 stars;Rendered useless;The product has the USB fitted upside down so when plugged horizontally into any laptop or MacBook, the curved magnetic bit that the watch attaches to faces the table below and the gap between the product and the table is too small to fit the watch. Very poor design. product was returned.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Hält nicht, was er verspricht.;Ich hatte das Gerät für das Laden unterwegs gekauft, wurde wegen der Pandemie nur 3-4 Mal benutzt, die  Uhr AW 6 wurde zuletzt innerhalb 12 Stunden nicht mehr richtig aufgeladen, bei ca. 50% war Schluss.Hatte mit dem Verkäufer wegen Garantiefall Kontakt aufgenommen, da das Gerät nicht mal ein Jahr alt war. Vom Verkäufer Shenzhen Xindeli Technology Co. wurde sehr frech geantwortet, das er die Garantieabwicklung ablehnt und ich mir ein neues Gerät kaufen soll. Ich habe mich dann mit Amazon in Verbindung gesetzt, wo mir sofort geholfen und der Kaufpreis erstattet wurde, DANKE Amazon!!!! Mein Rat: nicht bei diesem Anbieter kaufen!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Scalda;Preso perché piccolo e comodo da portare in giro non avendo i fili del caricatore normale. Molto bello da vedere e sembra fatto bene. Unica pecca… scalda tantissimo l’orologio… quando lo riprendi dopo la carica e’ bollente, sembra che anche arrivato a ricarica completa il caricatore continua a caricare facendo scaldare molto l’orologio. Per paura di danni permanenti lo sto usando pochissimo, solo se proprio necessario. Peccato
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not sent item as shown;Photo is a white charger, order says white charger, box has a white charger on it ..... inside it’s blackDisappointing
5.0 out of 5 stars;Pratique !;Très pratique pour recharger mon Apple Watch au bureau lorsque j’ai oublié de le faire à la maison.Pas encombrant, charge rapide.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Nicht fürs Auto gedacht;Läd sehr langsam. Fürs Auto nicht ideal, da die Uhr bei jedem Ruckler des Wagens vom Ladegerät runterrutscht.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Falla mucho y despues de pocos usos ha dejado de funcionar del todo;Lo uso solo para viajes y no mucho, enpezó a fallar a veces pero ya no funciona del todo. mala calidad y no funciona despues de pocos usos. Marca no fiable de baja calidad.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Regular;No cumple con mis espectativas...a lo mejor a otras personas le funciona bien.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Comodo e facile da trasportare non aderisce in maniera solidale;Mi è piaciuta molto la portabilità dell’accessorio trovo però che per quanto mi riguarda ho trovato poco stabile non c’è una perfetta adesione con l’orologio e inoltre ho notato una carica non molto rapida
1.0 out of 5 stars;Got very hot and crashed my watch with the heat;This isn’t safe. It got extremely hot, the watch was too hot to touch and it crashed the watch. It displayed one of those hot symbols on it, which I’ve never seen on an Apple Watch before, then it crashed. It also didn’t charge, but drained the battery - probably because of the heat it generated.*edit* the seller has contacted me and asked me to delete this review in return for compensation. I would definitely avoid.*further edit* the seller has been bombarding me with emails on a daily basis offering vouchers asking me to delete the review. Really irritating!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great for travel;I love this design, brilliant for travel. Magnet works well and charges well
2.0 out of 5 stars;Deutlich langsameres Laden!;Das Aufladen mit diesem Ladegerät dauert 2 bis 2,5 mal länger als mit dem mitgelieferten Originalladegerät.Der Preis ist OK, die Ladezeit müsste jedoch kürzer sein, um mehr Sterne zu vergeben.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Traue mich kaum noch;Ich fand das Produkt super für unterwegs, nimmt kaum Platz weg, kein langes Kabel, super. Aber bei Laden überhitzt das Ding so dermaßen, dass ich micb kaum noch traue, meine Uhr dranzuhängen. Habs auch in unterschiedlichen Steckdosen versucht, immer das gleiche
5.0 out of 5 stars;Caricabatteria Apple watch;Mi porto sempre dietro un computer, per cui riesco sempre a caricare il mio apple watch
5.0 out of 5 stars;Sehr praktische Ergänzung!!!!!!!!!;Ein tolles Gerät! Eine sehr gute Ergänzung zum Kabel. Sehr praktisch! Kann man auch gerne als Geschenk für Apple Watch Besitzer einplanen 👍
2.0 out of 5 stars;Bello, ma…;Il caricabatterie è bello, piccolo, pratico, con il magnete che fa il suo dovere anche se messo in verticale. C’è un particolare da non sottovalutare, l’Apple Watch si surriscalda molto, almeno quello che ho io, che è una serie 6, provato anche direttamente nelle prese usb del pc, ma il surriscaldamento, anche se più lieve si ripresenta
5.0 out of 5 stars;Best Product for decent price;I highly recommend this seller,very professional, high quality products.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn’t work;Doesn’t work!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Charges slowly;I specifically asked about the charging rate prior to purchase and was informed it’s the same as the Apple Cable. It is not! Charges very slowly. Added 12% (from 20%) in 45 minutes. With same charger and original cable added 35% in 30 minutes. I bought this for a quick charging boost when out and about and it just isn’t fit for that job.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not a good purchase;Watch heats up and doesn’t charge well
1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't charge!;It looks great and I was so excited but it doesn't charge the watch.  According to the display it is charging but actually it just gets hot and drains the watch battery. Disappointing. Don't waste your money.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Man kommt Langsam ans Ziel.;Der Ladevorgang geht deutlich langsamer als beim Original aber für Unterwegs eine gute Lösung.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Klein und handlich;Klein handlich überall zu verwenden perfekt.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Worst Product;Agreed with @Kate Bush’s review. This isn’t safe. It got extremely hot, the watch was too hot to touch and it crashed the watch. Now I see the sanke of death in the watch and even the original watch charger could not fix it. It also didn’t charge, but drained the battery - probably because of the heat it generated. I lost the watch because of the charger and Now I have to go to apple service centre to get it fixed. Hate it
2.0 out of 5 stars;Bello ma non convince;Bello ma il magnete non è abbastanza potente. La fase di ricarica è abbastanza lunga. Non mi ha convinto…
1.0 out of 5 stars;Ne fonctionne pas du tout.;Il ne fait que chauffer ma montre!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Crap!;Product doesn’t work at all!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Facile da utilizzare in auto;Facile da utilizzare in auto
3.0 out of 5 stars;Ziemlich warm und falsche Farbe;Das Ding wird ziemlich warm, ob das gut für die Uhr ist?Außerdem habe ich einen SCHWARZES Ladegerät bekommen, statt dem abgebildeten weißen.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Super 👍;Très pratique de par sa taille et efficace en plus !
2.0 out of 5 stars;Joli mais pas efficace;Le chargeur est très joli, léger et fin…J’ai bien enlevé le plastique comme conseillé plus haut dans les commentaires mais malheureusement la charge est très très très longue et la montre est très chaude.Le point positif est pour le design et la faible charge.Déçu.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Ricarica troppo lento!!!!!!!;Purtroppo la ricarica risulta molto più lenta rispetto al cavo di ricarica, estetica e tenuta buona ma l’ho reso perché non è valido da portare in giro perché in un ora di ricarica la percentuale sale solo al 40% rispetto al cavo originale che a parità di alimentatore va ben oltre 80%
2.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charging speed;Otherwise a great product but charging speed is too low. It takes very long to charge the watch. Original charging cable is much faster.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Funktioniert nicht an der Steckdose und nur bei manchen Devices;Das Gerät lädt die Apple Watch nur an manchen Devices mit USB Anschluss (Laptop, Docking-Station, etc.). Direkt an der Steckdose mit entsprechendem Adapter wird die Watch nicht geladen. Auch in meinem Auto habe ich diverse USB-Anschlüsse getestet, und bei keinem konnte die Uhr geladen werden. Für unterwegs, oder im Urlaub ist das Gerät somit vollkommen unbrauchbar und geht wieder zurück. Warum können die Hersteller ihre Geräte nicht selbst testen, und lassen dies von Kunden tun?
5.0 out of 5 stars;Fait très bien son boulot;Fonctionne parfaitement ! Discret, pratique, efficace
2.0 out of 5 stars;Leider sehr langsam beim Laden. Magnet sehr schlecht;Man braucht gut 5h bis die Uhr voll aufgeladen ist. Zudem hebt der Magnet die Uhr kaum. Die fällt sehr schnell runter.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Disappointed;Won’t charge in a USB wall socket. Will only work using a laptop.
1.0 out of 5 stars;PESSIMO;HA CARICATO 2 VOLTE E POI HA SMESSO DI FUNZIONARE. PRODOTTO PESSIMO!!!!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Schwache Leistung;Trotz unterschiedlicher Netzteile kaum Aufladung. Mit Kabel am selben Netzteil wurde die Uhr aufgeladen.Grundsätzlich gute Idee, funktioniert aber nicht wie erhofft.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Parfait pour les voyages;Parfait comme chargeur qu’on trimbale de partout !
2.0 out of 5 stars;Prodotto avcettabile;Prodotto accettabile, peccato il magnete un po’ troppo debole e la spina usb che non può essere ruotata in orizzoy

2.0 out of 5 stars;Schnarchlader;Der Ladeadapter ist handlich und passt in jede Hosentasche. Gegenüber dem originalen Apple Ladepuck gibt es aber einen entscheidenden Nachteil: die Aufladung ist quälend langsam. Über Nacht ok. Als Notlader um mal kurz ein paar mAh vor dem Training in den Akku zu hieven völlig ungeeignet. Damit hat das Teil mein Hauptkriterium nicht erfüllt!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Lädt langsam;Stylisch klein und gut für unterwegs, leider dauert das aufladen der Uhr eine gefühlte Ewigkeit.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Ma;Non carica come quello originale è molto lento e si surriscalda molto ed è caldo anche L orologio lo uso per necessità
2.0 out of 5 stars;Kein Vergleich zum Original;LasLadeleistung ist Grottenschlecht.Je nach Stecker ist die Uhr senkrecht oder diagonal. Magnet ist mäßig.Im gesamten eher nicht so geil.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Ladeleistung Ungenügend – keine Kaufempfehlung;Leider ist in der Beschreibung nicht ersichtlich, dass die Output Leistung auf 2 Watt begrenzt ist.Empfohlen werden 5Watt für das Laden der Watch 6.Der Ladezyklus 0 bis 100% mit diesem Produkt dauert also fast 3,5 Std.Zudem entwickelt dieses Produkt, wahrscheinlich wegen überlast wärme, die bei dem Original nicht auftritt.Das Produkt wurde mit Unterschiedlichen Netzteilen 2-20Watt getestet ohne dass sich das Ladeverhalten geändert hat.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Sehr langsames laden;Es dauert sehr lange die Uhr zu laden
2.0 out of 5 stars;Nicht so toll;Eigentlich super größe für Reisen. Leider lädt es nicht durchgehend, hat keinen guten Kontakt. Sehr ärgerlich
3.0 out of 5 stars;Cargador;Esta bien,carga bien pero se calienta mucho el reloj
3.0 out of 5 stars;Sympa, pratique mais pas rapide;Produit sympa mais le temps de charge est x3 par rapport au chargeur Apple Watch d’origine
1.0 out of 5 stars;Ladegerät wird sehr heiß. Vorsichtig!;Gefallen hat mir die Kompaktheit. Meine Sorge gilt der hohen Temperatur, die an der Powerbank beim Laden der Apple Watch 7 entsteht. Das normale Apple Watch Ladegerät verursacht diese Hitzeentwicklung nicht. Ich gehe hier nicht das Risiko ein, dass meine Apple Watch beschädigt wird und schicke den Ladeadapter zurück
2.0 out of 5 stars;Se calienta demasiado;Se calienta demasiado y no carga a la velocidad que debe.Es para salir del paso pero no me da demasiada confianza
1.0 out of 5 stars;Funktioniert nicht mit Apple Watch 7;2 x bestellt - 2 x nicht funktionsfähig mit neuer Apple Watch 7. Meine Uhr wird leider gar nicht geladen und ich habe mehrere USB-Ladegeräte sowie ein Macbook Pro ausprobiert 🤷🏼
5.0 out of 5 stars;Alles Okay;Alles super
1.0 out of 5 stars;Leistung ungenügend;Hatte mir das Teil für unterwegs gekauft wenn ich bei langen Radtouren in der Mittagspause die Watch mal schnell nachladen wollte. Aber 10% mehr Ladung in einer halben Stunde ist nix. Das original Apple Kabel lädt gefühlt 3-4 x schneller mit der Selben Powerbank. Außerdem wird die Watch mit dem Newdery extrem Warm. Zurückgeschickt!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not as shown in description.;Received black not white, as shown in photo and description. Returned for a refund.Seems to be an ongoing problem as seen another similar review.
5.0 out of 5 stars;works as advertised;It is compact, easy to use and I would recommend it.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Poor quality;Bought this for charging my Apple Watch but it keeps overheating and draining the battery also rubber bit to protect usb broke off after taken it from the box very poor and would not recommend to anyone

1.0 out of 5 stars;Malo y peligroso;Lo use una vez durante una hora y prácticamente no cargo nada el reloj. Pero la temperatura era de riesgo. Si lo llego a dejar durante la noche podría haberse quemado
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not at all reliable.;Stopped working after first charge, exchanged it for a new one and same thing happened again. Was literally able to charge my watch only once with this. Typical Chinese make, not at all reliable. The seller was kind enough to refund and take it back.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Taugt nichts;Billige Verarbeitung
2.0 out of 5 stars;lent;lentíssim, segons on l'endollis no carrega. no és funcional que per un rellotge et tiris un dia carregant per un dia d'ús

1.0 out of 5 stars;plastic cracked!;plugged it and it charges but cracks have appeared on the surface and there seems to be a raised part. Not confident to use it again.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Stop to function after 1 week approx;Does not charge anymore after one week. I should have notice somethingwas wrong when I noticed that the watch was getting warm on the screen while charging. ANd now the charger does not work anymore.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Lento e scalda troppo;Acquistato per avere un caricatore di riserva quando sono fuori.Ci mette moltissimo a caricare l'Apple Watch e dopo 10 minuti il retro è cocente. Ho paura che a lungo andare danneggi in modo permanente il mio dispositivo.Tornassi indietro non lo acquisterei.
1.0 out of 5 stars;No funciona;Lo tuve que devolver, no cargaba y calentaba excesivamente  el reloj.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Warmlsden?;Wird ziemlich warm beim laden
1.0 out of 5 stars;It doesn’t charge my watch;It actually takes any remaining charge out of the watch leaving it completely flat what a load of rubbish!!
1.0 out of 5 stars;four hours of Charge and nothing;my watch stopped working by using this product. I do not recommend it. i'm a lossy apple watch series
1.0 out of 5 stars;But design and really slow at charging;Looks clever but design is actually dreadful and doesn’t support the weight of afford not to mention the charging is dreadfully slow, save your money and buy an official charger

1.0 out of 5 stars;Ladegerät funktioniert nicht mehr.;Das Ladegerät funktionierte ein paar Monate und dann plötzlich nicht mehr. Keine Kaufempfehlung!!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Da evitare non funzionante;Salve a tutti usato poche volte mai funzionato preso proprio in emergenza per il mio Apple Watch la ricarica si vede solo ma non inizia mai rimane sempre lì
1.0 out of 5 stars;Eigentlich praktisch..;…aber nachdem ich meine Apple Watch mit dem Gerät geladen hab ist sie nun kaputt und muss jetzt ausgetauscht werden!! Ärgerlich..Die Uhr war eine Woche alt
1.0 out of 5 stars;Peligroso para el reloj NO FUNCIONA!!;Horrible!!!! No carga todo lo contratio DESCARGA! Enchufado a 93% de bateria y en pocos minutos me lo ha dejado en un 90% calienta la pantalla un peligro para el reloj. No lo puedo devolver porque tire la caja NO COMPREIS ESTA BASURA!!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Very poor quality;The item & watch become very hot when used to charge. Used it twice however I returned as I felt it was not safe to use!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Horrible;Takes hours to charge with this, while the Apple charger takes only 30-40 min max. Horrible waste of money. They sent me an email offering me €10 to take down my review. I think they should take the money and build a product that actually works.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Non funzionante;Ho dovuto effettuare il reso di questo articolo perché purtroppo non funzionava. Viene rilevato l’orologio, lo surriscalda ma non lo carica. Peccato.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Funktioniert nicht;Ich habe das Ladegerät an mehreren USB-Anschlüssen getestet. Es beginnt kurz zu laden, hört aber nach einigen Sekunden auf und es ist dann kein Ladefortschritt mehr zu erkennen. Schade, aber so ist es natürlich völlig unbrauchbar.
1.0 out of 5 stars;This product has no internal battery.;I don't see the point of this product. You can spend the same amount of money for a charger with an internal battery? Describing it as cordless implies it has a portable power source.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Waste of time!;The item description says good for travelling, camping but it’s not good for either as you always have to be connected to mains power. Easier to just have the usb lead that comes with the watch.Useless piece of kit!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Difficult to use.;Hard to find a compatible plug, watch always falls off of the charger.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Lädt sporadisch;Das Ladegerät lädt nur sporadisch, selten 100 %, meistens nur bis 45% oder weniger. Für mich absolut unzuverlässig und nicht zu gebrauchen. Meine Apple Watch lässt sich mit anderen Ladegeräten  problemlos voll aufladen.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Didn’t work.;This product didn’t work - wouldn’t charge my Apple Watch. Waste of money.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Schwarzes Gerät geliefert;Das Ladegerät kam zwar sehr schnell an, aber leider sieht es ganz anders aus. Auf allen Bildern, selbst auf dem Verpackungskarton, wird es nur in weiß mit brauner Schlaufe gezeigt. Tatsächlich kam  es bei mir aber in ganz schwarz an und sieht billig aus. Den Anbieter zu kontaktieren, verlief leider erfolglos. Gerät geht wieder zurück!

1.0 out of 5 stars;Prima ENTladegerät 😟;Leider muss ich die schlechten Bewertungen bestätigen. Jetzt mit meiner Apple Watch 1 mehrfach ausprobiert und mit 45% Ladezustand abends angeschlossen. Morgens 8% Ladezustand und knallheißes Gehäuse. Wenn ich die Uhr nicht lade, bleibt mehr Akkuladung übrig. Schade, wäre ein schönes und praktisches Produkt für unterwegs.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Entspricht absolut nicht der online Beschreibung;Der Artikel, der mir geliefert wurde, entspricht absolut nicht der Beschreibung auf der Amazon Webseite. Es gibt keinen Akku und daher hat es auch keine power Bank Funktion.Dieser Artikel ist lediglich ein usb Ladeadapter  für die Apple WatchEs geht sofort zurück.

4.0 out of 5 stars;der ideale mobile Ladeadapter für alle Baureihen der die Apple Watch;Wie laden Sie denn Ihre Apple Watch und müssen Sie unterwegs ggf. nachladen?Meistens komme ich über den Tag, doch da ich meine Uhr selten vollständig lade, ich belasse sie über die Nacht nicht auf der Ladeplatte, geht mir manchmal am Tag der Strom aus. Meistens passiert es mir dann, wenn ich die Uhr intensiv benutze, beispielsweise beim Sport zur Aktivitätsaufzeichnung und ggf. auch Musikstreaming via Mobilfunk, denn meine Uhr hat die Cellular Funktion. Ich benutze meine Uhr überwiegend ohne das iPhone, daher die Cellular Version, die jedoch mehr Strom verbraucht.Auf Reisen nehmen ich gerne eine Powerbank mit integrierter Ladeplatte für die Apple Watch mit, doch eben nicht immer, denn ich habe gerne leere Hosentaschen und scheue Taschen und Rucksäcke.Hier kommt das NEWDERY USB Ladegerät für Apple Watch ins Spiel, ich stieß zufällig als Produktempfehlung darauf und darf sagen, selten hat eine Produktempfehlung meinen Bedarf so treffsicher bedient.Der Ladeadapter ist unwesentlich größer als ein gängiger USB Speicherstick und er findet überall Platz, in jeder noch so kleinen Tasche.Über den gängigen USB Anschluss passt der Ladeadapter an jedes USB Steckernetzteil (nicht USB-C), jede Docking Station oder auch Powerbank. Einen USB Anschluss findet man fast überall, sogar im Auto oder in der Bahn, doch es fehlt oft am passenden Ladekabel, jedenfalls bei mir.Die Apple Watch hat den Nachteil, dass sie ein spezielle Ladeplatte benötigt und nicht auf den gängigen Qi Ladern für Mobiltelefone lädt. Geht Ihrer Apple Watch der Strom aus, brauchen Sie eine spezielle Ladeplatte. Ich hatte für den Urlaub einmal das originale Ladekabel vergessen, so musste ich im Urlaub auf meine Uhr verzichten, denn ich konnte sie nicht aufladen.Jetzt passiert mir das nicht mehr, das NEWDERY USB Ladegerät für die Apple Watch gehört nun fest zum Bestand meines Mobilsets (Netzteil, Smartphone Ladekabel), damit kann ich meine Uhr überall aufladen.Ist das nicht genial?Genial ist hierbei nicht nur dieser unglaublich kleine Ladeadapter, genial ist auch der Preis. Vergleichen Sie gerne mal die Preise der Apple Watch Ladeadapter...Wo Licht ist, so sagt, man, da ist auch Schatten und den gibt es auch bei diesem NEWDERY USB Ladegerät für die Apple Watch.Die Ladegeschwindigkeit des NEWDERY USB Ladegeräts könnte höher sein, denn sie steht hinter der des originalen Apple Ladeadapters deutlich zurück.Ich habe die folgenden Ladefortschritte mit meiner Apple Watch Series 5 44mm Cellular an einem 2A USB Port ermittelt:35% Ladestand zum Beginn  der Aufladung und Start der Zeitnehmung38% Ladestand nach 10min Aufladung51% Ladestand nach 30min Aufladung67% Ladestand nach 60min AufladungGemäß Spezifikation des Herstellers beträgt die Leitungsaufnahme des Adapters maximal 1A/5V, also 5W, während die Ausgangsleistung zur Uhr hin maximal 2W beträgt.Sie sehen an diesen Zahlen, dass man für eine vollständige Aufladung der Uhr allerhand Zeit aufbringen muss, doch ich sehe das nicht als Nachteil an. Der NEWDERY USB Ladeadapter ist für mich eine mobile Lösung, um bedarfsweise nachladen zu können und genau das erfüllt er ausgezeichnet. Ich strebe nicht an, während der Rast einer Wanderung meine Uhr vollständig aufzuladen.Die Verabreitungsqualität des Ladegeräts ist robust und zweckoptimiert, hinzu kommt die sehr kompakte Bauform und der kabellose Betrieb, demnach die ideale mobile Lösung. Sehr praktisch ist an dem Adapter auch die magnetische Fixierung der Uhr an der Ladeplatte, so kann der Adapter auch vertikal eingesetzt werden, die Uhr bleibt an ihm hängen.Bewertung:Im Fazit gebe ich dem NEWDERY USB Ladegerät 4 von 5 möglichen Sternen.Der Punktabzug resultiert einzig aus der etwas reduzierten Ladeleistung, in allen anderen Details bekommt das Ladegereät von mir die volle Punktzahl.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Un caricabatterie USB compatto, di discreta praticità e funzionalità;"L'Apple Watch è lo smartwatch che indubbiamente preferisco tra quelli che utilizzo ed anche quello da cui raramente mi separo in viaggio e quando ho notato questo NEWDERY Caricabatterie USB MAGNETICO, mi ha incuriosito ed ho deciso di provarlo.Il dispositivo arriva in una compatta pratica confezione del marchio e non appena rimosso ho riscontrato una discreta QUALITA' progettuale e costruttiva, con la scelta di materiali validi, ben assemblati, nel realizzare un piccolo dispositivo che mi ha trasmesso da subito buone sensazioni di affidabilità.Utilizzo già altri dispositivi per ricaricare in viaggio il mio Apple Watch da 44 mm della serie 4, ma che rispetto a questo NEWDERY presentano una propria autonomia ovvero una batteria interna che qui manca.Ammetto che inizialmente avevo compreso che questo caricatore magnetico fosse simile ad altri, ovvero che durante un viaggio fosse sufficiente porre sopra l'orologio per avviare la ricarica, mentre si tratta di un pur sempre pratico SUPPORTO DI RICARICA che però necessita comunque di una ALIMENTAZIONE con PORTA USB.Tralasciando le mia iniziali perplessità, sull'effettivo vantaggio di avere un dispositivo da viaggio che sia esclusivamente un supporto e non un alimentatore ""autonomo"", messo alla prova questo NEWDERY ho da subito apprezzato di come l'innesto USB funzione con estrema sicurezza ed affidabilità, non solo collegandolo ad un computer, fisso o portatile, ma anche ovviamente ad un alimentatore da muro per smartphone ed anche, ovviamente, nella porta USB della mia auto.A parte poi la COLORAZIONE rosa quasi ""confetto"" che rendono questo dispositivo più femminile che maschile, mi è piaciuta la scelta di realizzarlo in stile portachiavi e quindi dotato di un gancio che ne facilità la trasportabilità, grazie a DIMENSIONI compatte.Il DESIGN non è male, semplice, linea e pulito, con un sistema di aggancio del TAPPO che evita la perdita della copertura dell'innesto USB oltre che per preservalo da sporcizie ed impurità o rotture, sebbene devo ammettere che avrei preferito un gancio posteriore più saldo, magari in acciaio rispetto ad un laccio in pelle sintetica che, sebbene risulta curato ed elegante, potrebbe nel tempo logorarsi e tagliarsi.Alla prova della RICARICA, posizionando il mio Apple Watch sulla base, ho riscontrato una buona potenza magnetica, paragonabile alla base originale e ad altri dispositivi di buona efficienza che utilizzo, con dei tempi di carica che ho trovato sufficientemente rapidi, in proporzione alla fonte a cui ho collegato il dispositivo, ovvero computer, caricatore ma muro oppure porta usb dell'auto.Nel complesso mi sento quindi di promuovere questo caricabatteria NEWDERY per la qualità ed affidabilità costruttiva, un dispositivo utile e pratico per un utilizzo in ufficio, in viaggio, in auto che però obbliga ad avere una fonte di elettricità, non essendo autonomo con una propria batteria interna. si tratta quindi di un valido aiuto ma che personalmente ritengo inferiore ad una base di ricarica per Apple Watch che può essere indipendente e quindi utilizzato in qualsiasi condizione e luogo, volendo anche in aperta campagna o sulla cima di una montagna.Per ciò che riguarda il PREZZO di 14.99 euro a cui questo NEWDERY viene al momento proposto (maggio 2021) valuto che sia equilibrato per le caratteristiche del prodotto e la sua affidabilità operativa.In quanto alla spedizione e consegna da parte di Amazon, sono state ancora una volta efficienti.Mi auguro che questa recensione possa esservi di aiuto e se avete dubbi o quesiti non esitate a chiedere."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Mein rundum-sorglos- Paket für unterwegs;Da ich meine Apple Watch 6 täglich laden muss und sie auch nachts trage,reicht die Zeit oft nicht aus, um sie ganz aufzuladen.Dann habe ich oft das Problem, dass der Ladestand der Watch kritisch wird, bevor ich sie zu Hause nachladen kann.Da ich nicht überall das sperrige Original- Ladegerät mit der langen Leitung mitnehmen möchte, war ich schon länger auf der Suche nach einer handlichen Lösung.Das Kriterium der Handlichkeit erfüllt das Newdery Ladegerät wirklich optimal. Kleiner geht es kaum. Das finde ich richtig toll!Ich kann das Ladegerät problemlos in jede Hosentasche stecken, wo es kaum Platz wegnimmt und überhaupt nicht stört.Auch macht es einen sehr robusten Eindruck, ist gut verarbeitet und es gibt keine störenden Grate.Nun habe ich endlich die Möglichkeit, die Watch unterwegs fast überall laden zu können, da geeignete USB- Steckplätze aufgrund des sehr geringen benötigten Ladestroms fast überall zu finden sind. So sind z.B. auch PC- oder Notebook- USB-Buchsen, oder eine sogar kleine Powerbanken geeignet.Mein einziger kleiner Kritikpunkt ist die Ladegeschwindigkeit.Um meine Watch von 16% auf 100% zu laden, hat es 2 Stunden + 42 Minuten gedauert.Das ist nicht extrem langsam, sondern bewegt sich auf einem Niveau, das auch viele einfache stationäre Ladegeräte haben.Aber mit dem Original- Ladegerät von Apple dauert eine Ladung nur 1,5 Stunden.Hier ist also noch Luft nach oben.Aber um die Watch kurz nachzuladen, um zu verhindern, dass sie sich aufgrund eines niedrigen Ladestandes abschaltet, reicht mir die Ladegeschwindigkeit aus.Diese bleibt über den gesamten Ladebereich bei ca. 1% Ladekapazitätssteigerung in 2 Minuten.Um 10% nachzuladen, dauert es ca. 20 Minuten.Ich kann das Ladegerät jedem empfehlen, der wie ich das Problem hat, mit der Akkuladung oft nicht über einen Tag zu kommen.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Comodo se non si ha a portata di mano il proprio caricatore.;Per quanto io non ami particolarmente il mondo Apple, in casa abbiamo comunque un Apple Watch e quindi mi sono incuriosito nel vedere questo NEWDERY Caricabatterie USB.Se devo essere onesto alla fine il suo lavoro lo fa più che bene.Decisamente molto compatto, se ci troviamo nelle canne con la batteria e siamo sul lavoro o in posti dove non abbiamo a portata il nostro caricatore originale, questo può risolvere egregiamente il problema.Come in ferie, invece di portarci dietro l'originale, ci basta una fonte USB e con questo oggettino non abbiamo problemi.Ovviamente la potenza e quindi velocità di ricarica dipendono dalla fonte alla quale ci colleghiamo.La forma è ben studiata per renderlo in meno ingombrante possibile.La parte magnetica è pressoché identica alla base originale.Le plastiche sono di qualità.Se siete persone che rimangono spesso a piedi con il proprio Apple Watch allora credo che questo oggettino vi possa aiutare.In ogni caso, è un idea carina e interessante.Io ve lo consiglio.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Lädt langsam .... aber es lädt!!;Ja die schnellste Möglichkeit eine Apple Watch zu laden ist das nicht, über das USB Ladegerät, dafür eine gute Möglichkeit für unterwegs.Meine Frau hat in der Handtasche eine kleine Powerbank und am Schlüsselbund das USB Ladegerätchen für die Watch ... Da kann sie immer mal wieder wenn sie die Watch gerade nicht braucht, sie wieder aufladen. Unterwegs.... aber halt langsam. Aber immerhin, es lädt und die Watch kommt so auch durchaus mal auf 3-4 Tage Akkulaufzeit oder gar eine Woche, weil sie immerwieder zwischendurch Saft bekommt.Klasse Gadget!!!(Ja, man kann auch ohne sowas leben!)

 A compact usb charger for an Apple Watch ⌚️ in pink.It can be plugged into any usb supply, like a phone charger, computer, a usb mains extension, mains usb wall socket, power bank etc.The charger has a strap attached, so you can connect a key ring to it, to attach it to your bag, belt loop etc. It’s small enough, to just keep in your power bank box, along with all your leads.It connects and charges my wife’s Apple Watch SE with no problems. Just as fast as a Apple charger. Plug it in at night, and fully charged in the morning.Handy pocket size for visiting friends and family, holidays, or for use in the office, even plug into your cars usb socket etc. Never have a flat watch again.A great price and I’m happy to recommend."
3.0 out of 5 stars;Small and portable;This made in China wireless charger simply plugs into an USB 3.0 socket and is good to go.  The plastic dust cap fits tightly and protects the metal parts.  It is not particularly fast but is an adequate emergency stand by.  It takes about 3 hours to fully charge my Apple SE series watch.  I was a bit worried as the charger and watch was really warm to the touch.  This will be useful as a back up charger only.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Gets hot;This made in China small watch charger is compatible with my SE Apple Watch.  It is simple to plug into a USB socket on your computer and leave it to charge.  The whole unit is 6cm long and 3.3mm wide.  The cap fits securely to the metal part and is attached by short length of plastic so you don't lose it.  It took about 2 hours to to reach 40% and got really warm.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Zu unflexibel in der Nutzung, wirklich nur Notlösung;Verpackt in einem kleinen Karton mit nicht unbedingt notwendigem Plastik-Formteil. Beiliegend das Ladegerät und ein Info-Blättchen (englisch) Abb.1.Wirklich viel zu beschreiben gibt es hier nicht, klein, mit einer kleinen Lederschlaufe und einer Schutzkappe versehen.Verarbeitung empfinde ich als befriedigend und nicht unbedingt zum Preis passend (Abb. 2).Praktischer Einsatz:Leider kann ich die vielen die positiven Beurteilungen nicht teilen.Das Teil funktioniert zwar und damit hört es für mich auch schon auf.Sieht man es als kleine Notlösung, oder als Reiselösung an, kann man zu dem Urteil kommen „OK“, aber rund 15,- € für die angebotene Haptik, nicht mehr als drei Sterne, hätte man wenigstens noch ein Kabel beigelegt, so das man auch jedes Standard-Ladegerät nutzen könnte, hätte ich noch ein Auge zugedrückt.Denn so ist faktisch nur im Waagerecht-Betrieb der Ladevorgang möglich.Kommen wir zum eigentlichen (meiner Meinung nach) Denkfehler der Konstruktion als solches. Aufladung primär am Notebook (Abb. 3), denn es wird eine waagerechte USB Buchse benötigt, oder eben doch noch ein zusätzliches Netzteil.Bei Letzterem, geht es dann los, denn es kann nicht jedes Standard-Netzteil genutzt werden, denn je nach Ausführung und vorhandener Netzsteckdose, ist ein waagerechtes Einstecken in ein Netzteil nicht möglich (vom Einstecken in PKW USB Buchsen, je nach PKW-Typ, mal ganz abgesehen).Von daher, wäre wenigstens noch ein Adapterkabel beigelegt, würde ich ein Auge zudrücken.Zusammenfassung:Für mich faktisch uninteressant, da zu unflexibel, mir ist die Kabellösung deutlich lieber, da ich hier dann jedes Standard Netzteil nutzen kann. Daher für mich persönlich, aus beschriebenen Grund, maximal 2 Sterne.Für den, der es als Notlösung ansieht, das sind dann vielleicht die meisten, vergebe ich auch maximal nur 3 Sterne, aufgrund der Inflexibilität. Wäre wenigstens noch ein kleines Adapterkabel dabei, könnte ich mich vielleicht zu 4 Sternen durchringen, so aber bleibe ich bei 3 Sternen.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Gadget utilissimo anche se con prestazioni non al TOP;Ho preso questo gadget perchè rappresenta ciò che io intendo per gadget utile. Se avete un Apple Watch la vostra preoccupazione principale è come ricaricarlo quando siete in giro. Con il suo alimentatore in dotazione direte. Ovviamente si! Pensato però di avere a disposizione un caricatore wireless che potete tenere come portachiavi e che se avere un cavo chilometrico potete inserire nella vostra USB del PC e usarlo per ricaricare al volo il vostro smartwatch. Questo gadget unisce davvero la praticità di un daget compatto e carino da vedere a la funzionalità di un caricabatterie wireless tradizionale. Unica pecca che non mi ha permesso di dare 5 stelle è la durata della ricarica che è davvero un pò lenta. Potevo aspettarmi di meglio? Direi di no. Se lo provate rimarrete stupiti dalla praticità.
4.0 out of 5 stars;lädt gefühlt langsamer als das Original;Meine Apple Watch (S3) funktioniert mit dem Ladegerät super. Hält magnetisch fest, der kurze USB Anschluss hat sich am Ende allerdings als eher unpraktisch erwiesen. Habe das ganze nun an ein USB Verlängerungskabel angeschlossen. So ist es für mich besser.Nun kann ich Abends am Nachttisch im Notfall fix meine Uhr anschließen und in der Nacht runternehmen und muss nicht immer in Flur rennen, wo sonst alle unsere Ladegeräte hängen.Die Farbe ist natürlich schick, aber spielte für mich keine Rolle.Weil es so klein ist, ist es aber auch schneller im Urlaub eingepackt. Praktisch, aber den kurzen USB Anschluss sollte man bedenken, wenn man es nicht gerade an den PC anschließen will. Gefühlt dauert das aufladen aber länger als beim Original. Vor allem das Schnellladen am Anfang… wirkt jedenfalls langsamer.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Erwartet keine Wunder ...;... aber für den Notfall oder für's Reisegepäck reicht es.Wir haben kein Apple, aber unsere Kinder und oft kommt es vor, dass der Akku geladen werden muss, selten auch mal jener, von der Uhr. Da kam jenes Teil wie gerufen. Komplett aufladen ist hier auch nicht nötig, aber ein paar Prozent, wenn man zum Kaffee vorbei kommt, reichen ja auch vollkommen.Für mehr sollte man dann doch aufs Original zurück greifen.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Accesorio realmente útil y bien parido...;Yo soy de Android.Tengo todo Samsung, entre tablet, teléfonos, reloj, auriculares...Mi teléfono, es un Note 10 Plus y me permite cargar mi reloj o auriculares con tecnología inalambrica con carga inversa si le tengo que dar un chute a uno de ellos. Es una función la mar de útil!Esto, en un Iphone, a día de hoy, no es posible.Apple no permite que sus teléfonos carguen otros dispositivos. Bastante tienen ya con llegar al final del dia como para alimentar a otros equipos!Pues este aparatito tan sencillo, permite que, con cualquier power bank o con un portátil, puedas cargar el reloj en cualquier sitio sin tener que llevarte el cargador que trae por defecto.Es como llevarte un pendrive en el bolsillo y un power bank para tus emergencias, y si te quedas colgado, darle un empujoncito.La verdad es que esta bien parido, la calidad es buena y el ritmo de carga es algo lento, pero suficiente para el reloj. A razón de 2w, con una entrada de 5v y 1A.Por el precio que tiene, el tamaño y lo apañado que es, es uno de esos accesorios que puedes llevar en el coche por si acaso y así evitar llevar el reloj apagado el resto del dia si no lo pusiste a cargar la noche previa.Incluso para tenerlo en la oficina y darle un chute para que te llegue al final del día...Yo se lo he dado a mi hermano, que así como yo soy de Android, él es Iphonero y le ha venido de perlas, sobre todo porque no tenía ni idea de que esto existía. Comprará uno más para tenerlos repartidos entre el trabajo, la casa, etc...
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nützliches „immerdabei“ Gadget;Das Ladegerät ist schön klein und passt in jede Tasche oder auch an den Schlüsselanhänger.An meinem MacBook funktioniert es einwandfrei. Allerdings benötige ich dafür einen Adapter auf USB C. Die Schnellladefunktion  bleibt dabei erhalten.Das ist auch mein einziger Kritikpunkt: Warum wurde ein USB A verbaut? Für ein Apple Ladegerät hätte ich es für stimmiger gehalten, auf einen USB C Anschluss zu setzen. Bis auf die kleine Einschränkung eine gut umgesetzte Idee.

 A mi personalmente, la bateria de el reloj de Apple, tengo la version 4, me llega a durar dos días aproximadamente.Con este cargador de NEWDERY, si te quedas o estas a punto de quedarte sin batería en el Apple Watch, antes de ponerlo en modo ahorro de energía, puedes usar este cargador movil, que puedes llevar en el bolsillo, mochila, bolso o incluso en tu propio llavero.Su tamaño es reducido, es como una moneda de dos euros y tiene un conector USB-A el cual cuando no esta en uso, lo protege de los golpes y polvo, gracias a una capucha que este lleva incorporada al cuerpo del cargador.Como veis en una de las fotos, yo he tenido que ponerle un adaptador USB-A a USB-C para poder conectarlo a mi MacBook Pro, el cual solo dispones de salidas USB-C, pero también lo he probado con un hub y se carga perfectamente el reloj.Por el precio que tiene, creo que merece la pena tenerlo y echarlo en la mochila junto a una power Bank, así te aseguras de poder tener bateria para el movil y reloj.Espero que esta reseña haya sido útil."
4.0 out of 5 stars;⭐⭐⭐⭐ kleines Ersatzladegerät ⭐⭐⭐⭐;Man glaubt gar nicht wie sinnvoll so ein kleines Ladegerät für die Apple Watch ist, denn die Uhr lässt sich nur mit dieser Art von Ladepuck aufladen, ist man aber unterwegs und die Uhr hat fast keinen Saft mehr, so kann man dieses kleine Ladegerät in eine USB-A Buchse z.B. vom Laptop oder eines anderen USB-Laders stecken und die Uhr drauflegen.Dabei ist das Ladegerät auch magnetisch genug, das die Uhr nicht sofort runterfällt, wenn nicht alles gerade ist.Ich denke 4 Sterne sind für das Ladegerät angebracht.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Efficace e risolutivo;Funziona piuttosto bene ed è stato risolutivo in molte occasioni.Si riassume in queste poche parole il mio giudizio complessivo di questo supporto di ricarica USB per Apple Watch, in effetti lo sto utilizzando da circa tre settimane, e pur avendo un comodo laccetto che ne consente l'aggancio al portachiavi, preferisco invece utilizzarlo in automobile, collegato ad un alimentatore da accendisigari nella pozzetto frontale della mia Nissan Qashqai.Lo ho sistemato innestato orizzontalmente ed alla bisogna appoggio sopra di esso il mio Apple Watch serie 4 che rimane in posizione grazie al magnete di cui è dotato, in pratica nella mia esperienza quando lo faccio aderire all'orologio alla partenza e viaggio per circa un'ora, all'arrivo l'energia disponibile è di circa il 51%, ritengo quindi che con poco più di due ore lo smartwatch raggiunga la piena ricarica.Leggero, colore simpatico, ha un copri USB in plastica gommata che rimane comunque connesso allo chassis quando rimosso dalla posizione di protezione, questo per evitare di perderlo, ovviamente nell'uso scalda un minimo ma nulla di preoccupante.Il costo è più che equilibrato e comunque popolare ma il suo fiore all'occhiello e la portabilità, cosa che lo rende un accessorio importante per chi possiede un Apple Watch e che come me spesso ha necessità di ricaricarlo in movimento.
5.0 out of 5 stars;awesome watch charger;This Apple Watch charger is amazing, a nicely packaged and well-designed little device that plugs into your usb socket with ease.The end protective cap can go over the device end when it’s in use (is a little tight) or on the usb end to stop dust getting in etc when not in use or travelling with it. Also, another nice little design idea is the brown tag on the outer edge to make pulling it out of the usb socket a bit easier if you can’t grip all the charger pad.The changing pad for the watch is well sized and the watch magnetises on with a nice smooth motion to pull the watch into the right place to ensure maximum charging performance. I love this and it makes this work just like your apple watch changer but not all 3rd party chargers have this function.At £13.99 this is a great and much cheaper alternative to a second apple watch charger.If you have found this review helpful, please hit the helpful button as this inspires me to write more.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Comodissimo, un must have;Caricatore per Apple Watch comodissimo in viaggio, compatto e con USB-A che entra in entrambi i versi, con il tappo collegato al corpo con un piccolo cavo così da non perderlo mai.Carina anche la colorazione blu per uscire dal classico bianco di Apple, così come il piccolo dettaglio in pelle per farlo sembrare più premium.Nulla da segnalare riguardo la carica, funziona benissimo, forse non è il più veloce che io abbia mai testato ma usandolo di notte non è un problema perché la mattina dopo il nostro Apple Watch sarà sempre completamente carico.Io lo uso con un powerbank e lo trovo perfetto, ma si può anche usare direttamente su un caricatore a muro purché sia rivolto verso l’alto.Prezzo di 15€ decisamente contenuto rispetto all’originale Apple, un prodotto da avere.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Gut verarbeitet, leider ladeschwächen.;Das Ladegerät wird gut verpackt geliefert.Die Verarbeitung ist gut, keine Scharfen Kanten oder unsauberen Klebungen.Die Funktion ist gegeben, es Lädt eine Apple Watch Serie 6 ohne Probleme in 2,5 Stunden Voll auf.Das ist der Punkt der Leider 2 Sterne Kostet.Das Originale Gerät von Apple, bei Verwendung des Selben USB Ladegerätes, bei mir eine Steckdosenleiste.Lädt die Uhr in 1,5 Stunden Voll auf.Wer die Uhr über Nacht lädt hat damit keine Probleme.Ich jedoch hänge die Uhr morgens nach dem Aufstehen an die Ladung, brauche eine Stunde zum fertig machen und dann ist Uhr geladen und es geht zur Arbeit,  mit diesem Ladegerät nicht zu machen.Wen das nicht Stört , der bekommt hier ein gutes Ladegerät ohne Kabel Salat.Diesen Leuten kann ich das Gerät empfehlen, wer schnell laden möchte Finger weg.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Kein Original, dauert sehr lange und wird sehr warm;Ein kleines Ladegerät für Apple Watch SE / Series 2, 3, 4, 5 und 6. Einfach per USB angesteckt und die Uhr drauf. Dank des Magneten hält die Uhr recht gut drauf. Leider dauert das Aufladen der Uhr je nach Akkuzustand bis 2,5 Stunden und Uhr / Ladegerät wird etwas warm. Nur leider keine Dauerlösung, da langsames Laden auf lange Sicht ein Akku schädigt.Für eine Notlösung zum Aufladen z.B. auf Reisen etc. sehr gut, aber nicht jedes Mal. Das Design bzw. die Verarbeitung ist dagegen sehr gut, da gibt es nichts zu meckern. Da es kein Original Produkt von Apple ist, gehe ich damit Vorsichtig um. Das gleiche mache ich auch bei Smartphone (Ersatz)Ladegeräte. Diese Ersatz Produkte kommen oft nie vom Original Hersteller und können gut laufen aber auch nicht.Ich gebe das Produkt 3 gute Sterne!
4.0 out of 5 stars;NEWDERY USB Ladegerät für Apple Watch 6;Das NEWDERY USB Ladegerät für Apple Watch 6 ist gut verpackt und unbeschädigt bei mir angekommen.Das Ladegerät macht einen gut verarbeiteten hochwertigen Eindruck.Mir gefällt es sehr gut, da es wirklich äußerst minimalsitisch ist.Man muss sich jedoch genau überlegen, wo man es anschließt, denn das Kabel ist auch kurz und je nachdem wie die USB Buchse ist hochkant oder waagrecht, geht es mehr oder weniger gut.Bei einer Powerbank oder am Laptop geht es hervorragend.Ich hab eine Apple Watch 6 und da hat das Laden perfekt geklappt.Ein tolles Produkt das ich gerne weiterempfehle.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Ok;Zuersteinmal fällt der günstigere preis im Vergleich zum Original auf. Die Qualität und Verarbeitung sind top, der Ladepuk ist etwas dicker als da Original, dies stört aber nicht und fällt nur im Direkten Vergleich auf. Was mir allerdings aufgefallen ist, das beim laden der Apple Watch Series 6 diese wirklich sehr warm wird. ja sogar schon heiß. Auf Dauer ist das meiner Meinung nach nicht gut für den Akku da dieser bei hohen Temperaturen schneller altert und verschleißt.Daher eignet sich dieses Ladegerät eher für den Notfall, unterwegs oder im Urlaub.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Tamaño reducido y manejable. Comodo de llevar. Carga mas lento que cargador original.;Cargador Usb compatible con Apple Watch marca NEWDERY.Os dejo mi reseña despues de 15 días de uso.Se trata de un cargador portátil con conexión Usb compatible con todos los modelos de Apple Watch.El tamaño es muy reducido, se puede llevar en un llavero perfectamente o como es mi caso en la funda del portátil.Me gusta tenerlo a mano para dar una carga mientras estoy trabajando con el portátil.Lo he probado ya varias veces y no produce calentamiento al reloj, eso si la carga la realiza mas lenta que con el cargador original.Recomendable como segundo cargador para usos ocasionales.
5.0 out of 5 stars;not leaving the house without it.;No, seriously I wont be. I love this, anything to cut down on the amount of charging cables i leave the house with. it's brilliant and works very well with my iWatch 3. no issues at all and charges up just like it normally would. I can plug this strait into my power bank and I honestly like that is doesn't have a long cable. it's compact and theirs less chance of the watch getting knocked off it's charger if i can just set it down and leave it to do it's thing. you can even put this on a keyring.  pretty handy for plugging into a laptop even.  a great little handy iwatch charger to have on you.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Un po' costosetto per un prodottino alternativo;Questo caricatore per Apple Watch è comodo da avere sempre nello zaino, così puoi lasciare il cavetto della Apple sul comodino e sapere di poter ricaricare il tuo smart Watch in qualsiasi momento, anche in viaggio. Non avendo un cavo può essere scomodo in diverse situazioni. Inoltre il prezzo mi sembra un po' elevato per essere un'alternativa cinese.
3.0 out of 5 stars;⌚Carga algo lento pero perfecto para urgencias⌚;Mi mujer se pilló este cargador para Apple iWatch y según ella se trata de un producto de calidad media, es verdad que es útil cuando tienes que ir de viaje pues ocupa poco es más se puede usar como de llavero, su diseño es pequeño y la verdad que muy chulo, pero lo malo es que si lo usas como cargador normal de diario, se calienta mucho por eso ella lo recomiendo solo en ocasiones donde no puedes usar el cargador normal del Apple iWatch. Se usa mediante puerto USB y el color que eligió mi mujer es pink y a ella le gusta mucho es un rosa bebe así pastel.Según la descripción del producto el reloj se carga en unas dos horas pero no es verdad, es muy muy lento en cargarse y por eso el reloj termina calentándose mucho. Se trata de un producto que para una urgencia o viaje que no puedas disponer del cargador normal se saca de un apuro pero desde el punto de vista de mi mujer, el producto se podría mejorar mucho.💸El precio actual del cargador es de 12,74 euros, precio algo caro para ser un cargador.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Game changer;GAME CHANGER. The one thing I hated when moving to an Apple Watch from a Fitbit - super short battery life: it means that if you forget to charge overnight/in the morning, you risk it dying through the day, which is super annoying when working in an office every day. Enter this product: super small and easy to travel with. perfect for taking to the office in your handbag and easily charging your watch whilst there to ensure it never does again. Amazing price and charges quickly! Recommend.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Compacto, para poder llevar siempre con nosotros sin que moleste;Se trata de un accesorio muy práctico para tener a mano y en caso de necesidad poder recargar el reloj. Como tiene un diseño tan compacto podemos llevarlo incluso a modo de llavero con las llaves de casa y utilizarlo con cualquier puerto USB disponible, desde un ordenador, a una cargador de pared o incluso una batería externa.Una de mis preocupaciones al realizar el pedido era que al conectarlo en el portátil quedase en la posición adecuada para la carga y no del revés. Esto lo ha resuelto muy bien el artefacto, pues al contrario de lo que ocurre con un USB nomas no tenemos una posición correcta de inserción podemos introducirlo en las dos posiciones, así siempre tenemos la placa de carga arriba.El único punto negativo es que se calienta más que le cargador original u otros que he ido comprando a lo largo del tiempo, y aunque la carga la realiza de forma correcta no deja de ser una pequeña preocupación.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfecto para viajar con el Apple Watch;Un cargador super práctico y que funciona bien con el Apple Watch con el que hemos probado. Estábamos con miedo ya que a veces estos cargadores no suelen funciona nada bien, pero este va fino fino. Lo hemos usado con una batería externa y con un cargador de pared y en ámbos casos ha ido perfecto.La potencia de salida es de 5V-1A, por lo que no sobrecalienta el Apple Watch aunque tampoco lo carga rápidamente. con esto quiero decir que en cuanto a velocidad de carga es como el cable original. Al tener la superficie imantada puedes ponerlo en una bateria u otro cargador en forma vertical que no se cae. muy útil cuando no está accesible el poder cargarlo en horizontal.Para finalizar un par de detalles muy interesantes: Primero que el USB de entrada sirve en ambos sentidos, por lo que no hay que mirar en qué sentido se mete y, segundo, que cuenta con un pequeño colgante para llevarlo en el llavero o colgado de alguna otra parte, tanto es un parte delantera (junto a la tapa del conecto USB) como la trasera.Era un poco escéptico sobre este producto, pero después de probarlo me ha parecido muy bueno, recomendable.
5.0 out of 5 stars;kompaktes iWatch Ladegerät;Das Ladegerät für die iWatch ist schön klein und kompakt. Der Ladevorgang geht recht schnell und ist in spätestens 4 Stunden bei der iWatch 6 abgeschlossen, sofern noch etwas Akku-Kapazität vorhanden ist geht es auch schneller, meist hat es bisher um die 3 Stunden gedauert. Die Uhr wird magnetisch festgehalten, so dass ein versehentliches Abräumen nicht ganz so einfach geht, der Magnet hält sie sogar noch in der vertikalen Ausrichtung fest, für den richtigen Halt sorgt da aber die Schutzkappe des USB Steckers, der einfach abgezogen und dann mit dem anderen Ende auf den Stecker gesteckt wird. Nur wenn das Ladegerät vertikal in der Vertikalen eingesteckt wird, dann muss der Magnet alles halten.Gerade für unterwegs ein super Ladegerät für die Uhr, schön leicht und kompakt und vom Preis sehr ansprechend.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Pequeño y util;Todos sabemos que la carga del iwatch puede durar de un día a día y medio y el cargador que lleva de serie viene con un cable larguísimo. Yo almenos también lo tengo puesto en uno de esos adaptadores para poder cargar varios productos de Apple, iPhone, iwatch, etc con el que si me lo tengo que llevar de viaje o no he tenido tiempo de cargarlo pues que mejor que tener este pequeño cargador USB. Lo podemos dejar tanto en el coche como en la maleta así usarlo en cualquier momento, encima no ocupa nada de espacio y con cualquier adaptador USB o batería USB lo podemos cargar mientras conducimos o viajamos con algún transporte publico.El precio lo veo aceptable, quizás si fuese algo mas barato vendería mas. Esperemos que no falle a los días la carga inalámbrica.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Kompakt;Apple-Original Zubehör ist ordentlich teuer, wodurch sich ein großer Markt für Angebote Dritter öffnet.Das hier rezensierte Ladestecker (ein Netzadapter ist wie bei Apple nicht dabei) für die Apple Watch macht Apple vieles nach, der Preis ist allerdings deutlich günstiger (bei etwa 35%).Die Ladefunktionalität ist tadellos, ich habe keine Unterschiede zum Original feststellen können.Praktisch ist seine kompakte Bauform, die ihn ideal für’s Reisen macht.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Cargador Apple watch y USB;Cargador Usb para apple Watch compatible con todos los modelos, magnético inalámbrico, ofrece una carga sin cables conectando a un puerto usb.Velocidad de carga “rápida” de 2 a 3 horas pero he notado que se calienta bastante y no me da mucha confianza.Tiene un diseño muy elegante y al ser ligero y compacto puedes llevarlo donde quieras sin que ocupe mucho espacio, es ideal para llevarlo de viaje. No me da confianza este producto, temo estropear mi reloj.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Avoid.;This iWatch charger is great, especially for travelling. This charger will take up the smallest amount of space and it slots securely into a USB port, the watch sits on perfectly and is held in place with a magnet that is stronger than other iWatch chargers I have used, including the Apple version. Of course, this can be used at home as well as travelling and I'm really pleased with it. It seems to be well made and sturdy. I quite like that it isn't black or white too. I'd definitely recommend this and I'd buy it again.I am updating my review and reducing it from five stars to two. The two is because it does charge my watch but it is slow and the main thing that I have noticed is that my iWatch doesn't stay charged anywhere near as long as with my previous charger. So I have gone back to that. I will keep this to use for short term travel but I wouldn't buy it again.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Funciona correctamente;El cargador funciona muy bien y carga mas rápido de lo que esperaba en realidad😅.Tiene un diseño muy práctico y fácil de transportar y lo podemos llevar en la bolsa o incluso junto a las llaves ya que es muy ligero 👌🏼
2.0 out of 5 stars;No se ajusta bien;Me ha decepcionado, no carga bien y el reloj hace cosas raras cuando está cargandose, a parte que se calienta bastante. No me ha dado buenas sensaciones el cargador. No lo volveré a utilizar prefiero el de cable.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good for price;Doesn't seem to charge as fast as I expected but it's a decent charger.
4.0 out of 5 stars;It works good.;What I like the most is how long it is. I could move around easy.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Nice, solid charger. Get it.;I search for this charger even though I have a hundred different ones. I might just order a few more of these to have in different spots around the house & kick my other hundred to the curb.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Fast charging;works well and charges fast.  I've only had it a few days so can't speak to durability
4.0 out of 5 stars;My favorite;I love this cord. Everyone is always borrowing it. It's super durable and easy to use. You do need your own port if you need to plug it into the wall.
5.0 out of 5 stars;It was really long and I love that!;Love how long the cord is!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great;All of it.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great length, average charging;Love the length.Charging speed seems to be about medium.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Just got the product;Charging phone great price great delivery
5.0 out of 5 stars;Quality;Product was what I had ordered.
5.0 out of 5 stars;They work better than any other cord I've tried;These cords are phenomenal!  They are long and they charge fast!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Charges fast and very strong.;SO far so good, let's see how long it will last
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great Cable;I use these cables everywhere. On my bike, in my truck, at home. They are great and durable and awesome price.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Reliability/ Durability.;I bought the same cord from this company which hasnt done this so I must of got a bad one? The part that goes into phone snapped off like it was weak or maybe had bad soldering and my return date just past on the 3rd what a shame.Update - Great customer service and offered to replace the wire which was great.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works great;Nice long fast charging cord. Great price too!
4.0 out of 5 stars;it's amazing;it's perfect to reach when im laying down
4.0 out of 5 stars;Esta largo y puedes usar cel mientras se carga;Es flexible el cordon  me gusto mucho.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Lasts a long time;I like the fact isn't plastic and break like them ones
3.0 out of 5 stars;It mostly works;It charges my phone just fine but keeps popping out of the charging port for some reason, regardless of if there's a case on my phone or not. I'll be replacing it soon.
5.0 out of 5 stars;10 ft you fast charger C type;"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Great charger does what it is suppose to do .love it ty Amazon"
5.0 out of 5 stars;Better than the cord that came packaged with my phone!;My requirements when shopping for this cord:Fast charging - The cord that was packaged with my phone was fast charging but not as fast as this one has turned out to be!Long cord: The cord the phone came with was long but not quite long enough which required uncomfortable bending and leaning when a call came in while the phone was charging or unplugging altogether! This cord is really long! I don't need it to be quite this long but I have had to charge away from home in places where the outlet was not close so I like it!Sturdy plug ends: The one thing you cannot really tell about a product when shopping online is the sturdiness of the product! (Sure there is a return policy but then you have to start over and wait for it to arrive again!) The plug ends looked to be sturdy in the ad photos and that has proved to be the case. Everything about this cord feels sturdy. -- no flimsiness at all, yet it coils nicely. My original cord had gotten to the point that it was getting harder to get a connection for charging. Since the first charge, there has never been a need to wiggle or shake the phone to get it to charge.Other: I love the braiding on the cord. Not really all that important but in addition to looking nice, it gives a bit more sturdiness to the cord as well and why shouldn't a charging cord look nice? I got the black and white but there are other colors too. It was also quite affordable.All in all, I have been very pleased with this purchase! I want to find a car charger now!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Sometimes you have to turn it around to charge.;It could be better.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Just fine;Looks better in the picture. As for the charging ability, it seems a bit slower than my previous cord. Still it is a good product. Worth it.
3.0 out of 5 stars;The long length is awesome;Loved the length but with just normal use the cord frayed and was no longer able to charge
4.0 out of 5 stars;Love the durability and length;I have very happy with the durability as well as the length. But I am guessing that the reason it charges a bit slower than my shorter other charger cords is the longer length. But overall, I am happy with it.
4.0 out of 5 stars;It works!!;This is a great product
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good;Na
3.0 out of 5 stars;Slowed Down???;Ordered this cable 6 months ago because the one that came with my phone was about two inches long. From the moment I plugged it into my phone (Samsung A32), it has worked very well.Until recently.I'm currently trying to learn how to walk again, so I use my phone for entertainment here in the long-term-care facility. The charging port for the A32 is on the bottom, so using it plugged in bends the cable... on the strain relief.While there's no fraying like others have reported, it has that bend in it... and in the past week charging has become slower and slower.  To the point that in the few minutes it's taken me to type this, the charge has dropped a percentage point DESPITE BEING PLUGGED IN.Obviously the phone no longer reports being charged at high speed.So I'm not sure how to grade this cable. It worked very well, right up until the point it didn't anymore. Now it feels like I'm driving a Ferrari on a donut spare tire, wondering at what point its going to fail me altogether.
3.0 out of 5 stars;One cord did not work;One cord did not work
3.0 out of 5 stars;Eroor de diseño.;En todo perfecto, pero en la parte de conectarlo al teléfono es muy grueso y hay que quitar el case del teléfono.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works great, charges fast;Charges fast, seems durable, just got it so can't tell much
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great charger;It came fast and works exactly as advertised.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Still testing, but happy thus far.;The USB-C, AKA Lightning, plug solidly engages unlike the Lightning cables from Apple similar products. I am thankful this USB female to USB-C cable fits, works great and the length is awesome. The sturdiness of the braided cord will prove to be long lasting.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Fast charge!;It charges my phone really fast, the cord is extremely long and well made. I'm happy that I made the purchase.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Sturdy, but failed in less than a year;These USB cables are nice and long. They are a bit stiff, but that probably helps with durability. They felt like they would last a long time. But ultimately, one of them that gets the most use, has started to disconnect and reconnect frequently during charging. It seems like the wire is broken just behind the end that plugs into my phone. It's been just less than a year.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great length and value;Good quality charging chord.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Worried... Don't think durable.;Ehh. I'm noticing some fraying at the end where I plug in to my phone. And I just only recently bought it. Not sure how long it will last.Edit.Wow. June 18 2022 I purchased this. It just died. Stopped working. Dec 16 2022. Just shy of 6 months. Completely not worth it.  I had cords that I used rigorously, like I travel with them was rough etc. This was my bedside one. Couldn't of been handled more delicately. I've never had one of these break before when used in the same manner. I needed this to update with my new phone is usb c now. Man.I was right tho. It's weird to. I plugged it in was charging. Then it turned off. Didn't touch it or move it.  It's not damaged. Aside from some cord fraying. Which was how I got it.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Long time to charge;The cord length is good but it takes several hours to charge from 50% to 100%
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not 10' as advertised.;False advertising. The listing said this charging cord is 10' long. It's not. It is 6' long. Seems like a fine charging cord, but I needed one that is 10' long.Thumbs down!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Loooooooooong cable;"When I got this I thought ""What the hell will I do with all this cable?""Yeah, the length is in the description, but woah, it seems much longer IRL.Well, got my question answered. I use the cable everywhere. Being able to move around while still charging my devices is freeing. I'm no longer tethered to a power outlet.Worth the money"
5.0 out of 5 stars;A little charger goes a long way.;I like the length of the cord.  I don't have to go to another room  to charge my phone.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Thank;Is worthwhile get it thank you
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great charger!;The length really helps!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Seems like it will hold up well;My wireless charger seems to have died, so I needed a new charging cable. I actually wanted a shorter one, but I didn't want a pack of three or five or whatever. This cable seems to be well made, it works with fast charging, and it was reasonably priced. I like that it's not black - so I can tell it apart from all the other cables. I have just coiled it up to a shorter length, so it's just fine.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Just as described;Product was exactly what I needed and works great.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Great ...while it worked;I was excited to receive this cable to be able to charge my phone in hotel rooms in which the a/c outlets are far away from the beds.  For the first 45 days, it was fantastic.  However, for the last month, it has become increasingly slow to charge. Even when using my Motorola rapid charger wall plug, the phone chargers slowly.  That is when the cable will actually stay plugged into my phone.  I thought it was the USB c port on my device but when using other cables, there is no problem.  Perhaps the connector on the cable is poorly made?  I bought this on August 18, 2022 and as of November 12, 2022, I have a 10 ft braided rope.  It has been less than 90 days and Amazon is not offering a return option.  Do yourself a favor and pass on this cable.
4.0 out of 5 stars;For the length it is a great product;It's a great charger for Motorola phone
4.0 out of 5 stars;Really lo g cord;Charging phone
4.0 out of 5 stars;Update: 👍🏻 company great! Charger stopped working within the month.;Worked fine for about a month. Now it won't charge. (Return window closed 1 day before it stopped). UPDATE: the company reached out, and offered to send a replacement charger right after writing this review. Almost a year later, new charger haa been working just fine.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Difficulty plugging into S20 with Otterbox Commuter;The cord seems fine, however once I installed an Otterbox Commuter on my Galaxy S20 5G, it was very difficult to push the cord in to charge the phone.  The fat part of the tip kept getting stuck on the otterbox.  If the trip was a little more narrow I wouldn't have any problems.  I eventually did get it to fit, but this may be problematic going forward.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good chord.;Good length for charging when you are traveling
4.0 out of 5 stars;Easy;This has followed me for a while and it has been my best friend! Lol
4.0 out of 5 stars;Not so durable;This is the 2nd time I tried this cord. It lasted about as long as the 1st one: about 3-4 months. Sometimes the device wouldn't charge while the device was being used.
4.0 out of 5 stars;let's see here;The length comes in handy for someone like me who has the sockets far away from each other. I can be at my desk and the charger plugged in all the way over the night table (that's a good length). I noticed 3 days after use that some of the threading became loose and I'm a bit worried...but I might have to use cellotape over it.I also noticed that it supports my fast charge adapter...it seems durable thus far.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Broke within weeks;Vlbroke too quicklu
4.0 out of 5 stars;Broke right away;Great long length for my son but it broke too soon so now we can’t charge his ipad
5.0 out of 5 stars;Durable;Fast charge
5.0 out of 5 stars;Long fast charge;10 foot long
5.0 out of 5 stars;Charges fast;Works great
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not a fan;Says fast charger but is only charging regular.  The plug is too fat to charge with the case on.  I like the length and durability even being a regular charger I can deal with but not fitting into the port with my case on really stinks.  I have purchased this twice but only because the first 1 never arrived.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good for almost 1 year;I mainly used this cable to charge my phone from June 2021 to June 2022.  After just over one year of roughly three cycles a day (about 1000 cycles total), the connector is electrically loose and unreliable.  Now, if I insert the cable into my phone, there's a less than 50% chance that the connection remains secure.  Otherwise, the connection will terminate with the cable still fully inserted.  My phone's USB-C plug remains reliable when used with other cables.USB-C connectors are officially required to support 10,000 cycles.  Therefore, from my experience with this product, this cable will only give you 10% of the required longevity of a proper USB-C cable.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good Value;It does what I need it too
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works;Works good
3.0 out of 5 stars;Quick charging;It does not charge as fast as it says but I love the long cord
5.0 out of 5 stars;One of;One
5.0 out of 5 stars;Quality and length;Great quality, nice and long.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Unreliable;Both chargers went out around the same time.  I purchased these at the end of August and today is October 10th and they no longer work.
2.0 out of 5 stars;NOT compatible with Samsung Note 8, even though they SAY it is. PHONE says it'll DAMAGE the device.;NOT compatible with Samsung Note 8 AT ALL, even though Seller SAYS it is compatible with Samsung Note 8 fast charging.Everytime I plug it in, my phone gives me a WARNING that this cable can harm my device.MMM - that I need to check the connection.Also, the screen has flickering lines of various brightness across it the entire time this cord is plugged in.DO NOT BUY for use on a Samsung phone, even for models they SAY it's compatible with. Because it is NOT.TBF, it *seemed* to work ok at first. My phone did not give me warning messages until maybe (2 weeks?) after I started using it.(Maybe a software update added the warning messages, or maybe a chip in the cable broke, creating a harmful Amperage, making it incompatible & that's what began promoting the messages. I dunno). I just know that it's a bad idea to use this cord on a Samsung Note 8. The flickering screen is feedback that is bad for the device.When I plug in the 3ft OEM version that arrived with the phone, the screen is normal, & there are no warning messages.I no longer remember if the screen was ALWAYS funky when I used this charging cord, or if that started when the messages started.This product is a waste of money & time, and will probably harmed your device. Do not trust this cable, OR this company. It's claims are lies. Or it is completely shoddy manufacturing. Either way it is a terrible product. You cannot trust this company.I'm now Buying a Samsung OEM version, even though it it's difficult to find one worth a reasonable length cord. (Dear Samsung: 3ft is UNREASONABLE - except inside a car). 6ft is necessary for most circumstances. Even 5ft is acceptable. Many people even appreciate as much as 10ft. We also want voters that won't simply break ah la pinching, particularly at the joint.Cord itself seems sturdy, and is definitely long.  In fact, 10ft is too long. Probably about 6ft would be ideal.The Amps is NOT what they say, & your devices could be damaged.
5.0 out of 5 stars;not a fast charger;this is not a fast charger!!!..please fix peoduct description
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great customer service!;I wanted to like these because of the nice length, but that's the only good thing. Every time I charge my phone it always tells me to check my charger connection! And says it is over an hour to be fully charged  It is SO SLOW to charge.UPDATE: Updating my review to 4 stars.  After writing my review, I received communication from the seller, and was sent out a new charger.  This one works!!! All the time!  So happy with the customer service I received.  Will buy more in the future.
4.0 out of 5 stars;It’s nice..?;I’ve had this for two days now and it’s working fine but I don’t know how long it will work. Usually when I get chargers from Amazon they work from one month to almost a year so it’s really a gamble with this. Hopefully it works longer than a month!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Works but only for a short time;Charging cable works and is a great length. It's not long before it doesn't fast charge anymore and your phone is saying to fix your connection.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Disappointing Product Life;I charged my phone 5-6 times a week, at night, with this USB. Great length and charge. But almost exactly 6 months later it died. I'm no teenager mishandling equipment. It was in the same place and unplugged at most once. Throwing away a USB cord is not a big deal but dead after 6 months of once-a-day charge? Ranks low on my environmental sustainability list.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Won't Fast Charge;My phone was having problems charging, so I thought I would just replace the charger. Only when I got this cable, the phone still wouldn't charge. So I got my phone replaced with the same model (Samsung A51), thinking it was a battery/port issue. Only now the new phone isn't charging quickly with the new cord, but will fast charge with the old cord I had. Not sure what's going on, but considering the phone is brand new and works fine with the charger I got for my old phone, but not with *this* one, kinda think it's a cord issue now.Love the length though. And it charges other Type-c accessories I have, like my wireless earbud case. Just wish it would work for my phone.EDIT: Customer service is great, though. I'm impressed with the quick responses and willingness to offer solutions.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Awesome charger;Cord length is perfect charge super fast
4.0 out of 5 stars;Exactly;It's way long!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Durability is pretty terrible;after roughly 1 year of using the cable roughly once a day it now doesnt propperly connected and I get the improper connect warning on my phone basically every time I use it. Its fine in every aspect execpt for the durability which is just far to bad to consider buying. Go spend a little bit extra on a cable that wont die on you after a year.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Dependability;It's nice!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works Well;This seems to work very well with my Samsung Galaxy Note 8, which has not always been the case with other cords.  I like that I can plug it in almost anywhere and still have it reach where I need it.  It is made of a very durable material.  I would buy it again.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Slow;Does the job but slowly.

5.0 out of 5 stars;Great!;Good. DURABLE
2.0 out of 5 stars;Worked okay at first.;with an occasional unable to connect.  Now daily I struggle with keeping my phone charged because it doesn't make a good connection with the phone.  Would not buy again!!!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not really excited about this charger;I was searching for a quick charger and this is advertised as such. It is however a much slower charger than my slowest slow charger. I love the length and it seems very durable but I'm not happy speed of charging.
5.0 out of 5 stars;EXCELLENT PRODUCT;I have purchased several of these C Cords and haven't been disappointed yet. Long lasting and very durable. Will purchase from again.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great quality over priced;Great quality over priced
3.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't last;I love the length of this cord. It was a factor in me purchasing 3 of these since last August. Alas, it doesn't last long. Within a few months of use, it becomes positional regarding whether it charges or not. Last night, my 2nd one failed to charge at all and I am now on my 3rd. I will still purchase them because of the convenient length (very useful in hotels where there may not be an outlet close to the bed) but I won't expect them to last very long.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Won't stay plugged it.;The cord falls out of devices. Loose fitting  It charges great when it stays, but it's not very secure which is disappointing.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Using for rechargeable Escobar;Worked as it should.
5.0 out of 5 stars;nothing;cord extened phone cord so not too short
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not very durable, barely lasted 4 months;After using this cord for about 4 months, the metal end of the cord that we used to connect to the phone was getting very hot to the touch. The other metal end that connects to the LG USB plug was cool to the touch. We noticed it was very warm even when not charging but still connected to the outlet using a LG USB plug in. Over time, the metal part gets VERY hot, it is a fire hazard. We also noticed any phone connected to the cord won't charge now, so something happened to the cord. The cord doesn't appear damaged and nothing has been done to the cord that could have damaged it. Going to look into another cord that doesn't have a metal end and better quality.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Type C Charger 10 ft;Been using this on my go-pro and so far so good
5.0 out of 5 stars;It works!;To charge a golf caddie
3.0 out of 5 stars;Works great - for its short duration ...;I've purchased this item 5 times. It has a great length and in the beginning it's awesome! That goes downhill fast though, so enjoy it while you can. The first couple lasted a decent amount of time. The last two have been horrible. I purchased one in December, it stopped working correctly within 6 weeks. I bought another January 3rd and within one month it is now glitching. There is NO damage to the item. It has NOT been bent, cut or mistreated. It is just glitchy and unfortunately with this limited life, I cannot purchase new chargers every month.I'm going to have to try to find a better charger, there has to be one out there.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works well;I use it to charge my phone while responding to emails, texts and fb/ig.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Awesome length. Fast charge;Awesome length. Fast charge
5.0 out of 5 stars;Cord is good.  Durable, flexible and long enough to move around.  Pets like to chew on it though.;"Great, durable power cord!  Flexibile enough to round corners, under rugs, under desks.  I love it. Only thing is that ""cat"" really enjoys chewing the fabric covered cords.  I tried a theory experiment:  to spray a well known 99.9% virus and bacteria killing spray, with a glove to saturate the entire length.  Who can stand the smell?  I could not imagine the taste! Ha!  Victory.The OTC pet ""bitters"" do not work for long.  The chemical spray does.  As for the PETA ppl, said ""cat"" goes no where near any of the treated cords.  The smell repels he enough.  Does not ingest said chemical.  I would never poison ""cat"".  ""Cat"" is the best rescue ever.Cord is good.  Buy it."
3.0 out of 5 stars;not good for laptops, im kinda dumb, sorry;Admittedly, this may be my fault for not knowing much about USB-C chargers. I did not know that my laptop needed a USB-C to USB-C charger so I got this one because I needed a charger with more length and durability. I thought this would work since it's advertised as fast-charging. I intend on returning it or giving it to someone who has a device more appropriate for it.Shipping, durability, and length are great- certainly get your money's worth in those areas- I just didn't know much about USB-C cords at the time. So make sure you do your research and check reviews BEFORE purchasing things.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good cord for a while but stopped working after a couple of months;Durability
2.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't stay connected to phone;Works with my fast charge brick, aestheticlly very nice. But can't use my phone while it's connected to this charger because it won't stay in. If I gently place it on a flat surface, it will stay connected
4.0 out of 5 stars;Looks ain't everything.  I do not have a way of knowing how well they will last.  We shal see.;They appear to be good, but time will tell.  It's like getting a new boyfriend.  Looks good up front, but time will tell.  We shall see.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Didn't last.;These unfortunately started out great but stops charging my phone after a while. I have a Samsung galaxy note 9 and I notice other chargers would charge my phone but this one didn't. Thought it wouldn't be easy to bend because of the material but thats false. Giving it a 3 star review just because.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Works great until it doesn't;Stopped working completely after a few months but it worked great until then
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not as described;Described as fast charging but after 3 hours of charging, my iPad had only charged about 10%.
4.0 out of 5 stars;So far so good;Happy with this product
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not Fast Charging;This was for my grandson and it isn’t fast charging compared to his older charger - he wanted length and fast charging and it didn’t meet his expectations😞
4.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped working;Worked fine until recently.  Stopped working correctly.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not durable;This stopped working way too quickly since I had it in the same spot for a couple months, once I went on a trip, it stopped charging my phone. I prefer something smooth rather than braided, it got caught on stuff.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Cool;Bad ass
3.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped fast charging after less than a month.;This cord seemed good for a bit, would charge my phone in a reasonable amount of time. Now it's taking 5+ hours to charge. I had to buy a different cord already and it has been less than a month.
3.0 out of 5 stars;metal sleeve around the type-c connector came loose almost immediately;The tiny oval cylinder that is around the type-c end came loose and slide around.  Really hope the exposed wires aren't a fire hazard.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Like it don't love it;Works great but hate it have to take case off to get plug to fit in my phone
3.0 out of 5 stars;Didn't Work, Then it did.;Not sure why it didn't work at first.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Just as described;Charged my phone
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect file xfr from Android to PC.;I bought this hoping it would let me transfer video from my Samsung phone to a laptop PC.  Worked effortlessly. Thumbs up!
4.0 out of 5 stars;As advertised;Well made appears durable
4.0 out of 5 stars;Cord need;So far so good.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works as expected;Works like it should. Seems durable enough
5.0 out of 5 stars;Sturdy Cables with the length I need;Not the first time ordering and the last cables I purchased from this seller are still in use.  Only reason I've had to order again is I've purchased additional items at home which require different interfaces.  Extremely happy with these cables and this seller.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped working correctly after less than 2 months;I loved the length of the cord, and the charger was working perfectly until about a week ago. Now it's hit and miss as to whether it will charge at all and when it does it blips back and forth from slow charging, to fast charging, (mostly slow), and check your charger. Very disappointed and will not order another one.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great product;Great product good quality
3.0 out of 5 stars;Lol not even a month;I was happy with it at first. Seemed to charge fast and work good but it didn't even last a month before it no longer wants to charge. There doesn't appear to be physical damage to it so I'm assuming it's probably crappy wiring job done on it.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Didn't last more than a month;The charger is plenty long and seems fairly durable. Everything was fine the first three or so weeks I had the charger. But now it only charges my phone if I hold it a certain way and even then, it says it'll take 4 times longer than it should
3.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't last very long with a lot of usage;Great for people who aren't on their phone while charging it. Won't last long if you are, which to me would be the primary purpose of such a long cord. The cord itself is super strong and durable. The end that plugs into the phone is the issue if used a lot while charging.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Cheap but could be of higher quality.;Love the extra long length of the cord but the connector is cheaply made and tends to bend easily when accidentally dropped.  But inexpensive enough for have more on hand.  This is my 3rd set of cords,  they must be doing something right.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Issues;It may not be the cables fault but when I use this charger my MiFi gives me a message every 5 minutes that I am using a slower charger and switch to the original charger.  I bought this charger so I would have the ability to charger in more places but my device isn’t as compatible with it.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Sturdy;Appreciate this new charging cord! It's length is helpful, but as I'm using it more I keep getting a note popping up that I should use an original cord and this one says it's 'slow charging' all the time.
3.0 out of 5 stars;broke in about 3 weeks;the charging power is good, the length is good but it broke in 3 weeks, I had bought it originally because my other charger broke.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great item!!!!;This is a wonderful usb type c charger. Works great.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works great;Works great and the extra long 10ft length is quite handy.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Weak connector;As all of the USB c connectors, they all have a weak connector,
5.0 out of 5 stars;Charge Relif;Tired of having a dangling phone trying to charge? This is the cure. Nice sturdy fabric covered cable with stout connectors. Excellent length to allow freedom while charging.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Worked for 7 months;Was extremely careful with plug in end due to past experience but after 7 months quit charging.
5.0 out of 5 stars;So very handy!;Finally a charger with a cord long enough to plug in and reach the table!The charger dies a great job on my Samsung S8.
3.0 out of 5 stars;L O N G B O I;I got what I expected. Great length, but kinda loose and fiddly in my Dualsense controller but that could be either tbh. Don't expect miracles, you're only looking at this cause you need a cheap usbC quick. Could easily do worse.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Wish it would charge my iPad;Very sturdy product but unfortunately does not charge my iPad. Ugh!!!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great charging cord, works well!;Like the length, also durability
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good Product;Very good cord.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't last long;First of all, I liked the length and the fact that the cord seemed durable. The rest of it however left a lot to be desired. I purchased this back in October and I pride myself on how well I maintain my cords. A few months ago, the housing on the outside came off. (Picture #1). It was still functional This morning, I plugged it in, set it on my dresser and shortly after I heard the cord hit the floor. I thought I didn't plug it in good enough but to my dismay, the charging plug actually came disconnected for the cord.Good for a while but don't waste your money for long term.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped Fast Charging a month into purchase. EDIT: Now Struggling to charge at all.;Edit/TLDR: Literally got the charger in January, stopped Fast Charging barely into February, Struggling to charge throughout March and so far April. I don't reccomend this cable.When I got this cable, it did a wonderful job fast charging my S10 since my old charger got chewed up several times from our robot vacuum cleaner. (I kicked the vacuum out of my room and started to vacuum manually.) It was nice to have fast charging on my phone again and a month in, it stopped fast charging with the occasional poor connection from the cable. I checked the cable and the original plug but it seems to be just the cable acting funky. I used other cables around the house and my phone charges just fine, just seems to be this one. I've tried cleaning it and my phone and nothing seemed to work. I'm just more disappointed than upset because I thought this would be a long-lasting replacement.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Cheap Quality, but works;I have to plug it in to my phone *just right* to get it to charge, and one of the end cover pieces has already came off just a couple months in. It probably won't last me but another month or two, but it does work, so....
3.0 out of 5 stars;A great charger if it were more durable;I really loved this charger when it first arrived. I was so excited about the length because I could use my phone on the charger while on the couch or in bed and the charger would reach and get pulled on less. However, after a few weeks of regular use, it needs to be held at a certain angle or it won't charge and I keep getting a notification to make sure it's plugged in properly, even when I've checked it multiple times.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not as good as expected;Charger does not stay in the phone. It keeps popping out.  Takes longer than the cheaper Target charges to charge
5.0 out of 5 stars;Does the job;Durable and just the right length.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Slow....;Described as fast charging.... so when I plugged it in to my Samsung S10 it said it would take 3+ hours to charge.  Phone was at 51% when I plugged it in.  Definitely NOT fast charging!! Will probably just donate it to Goodwill and order from someone else.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great charger;It's strong and durable. Charger's my phone fast
3.0 out of 5 stars;They don’t last long;They only last about 3 months then stop working.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Didn't last long... Company sent replacement after this review;I really liked the length and thought the braided cord would give it extra durability --- didn't happen. It was bought less than a year ago and has stopped working.  The short cord I got at the same time is still working great. This cord was not under any stress or strange configuration so I'm not sure what happened.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charge;Boy....4 hrs to charge phome fully...that is long!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Fragile;the ONLY downside is that it broke
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not made to last;Lasted less that a month
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great quality!;Great quality cable. Works perfectly!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Ehh;You get what you pay for.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Arrived quickly and was as advertised;Seems to do the job, durability will have to be evaluated as time goes onward.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Only worked for 30 days;Stopped working  after 30 days
3.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't fit very well.;It is almost perfect EXCEPT for the fit. It doesn't hold the way it should.  If I move my phone when it's plugged in it comes out. But otherwise not bad.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped Working After 2 Months;**UPDATE**This company has great customer service! The manufacturer reached out to me shortly after I left a 1 star review, apologized, and replaced the defective cord. Hopefully this one will last!Original review:The length of the cord and fast charging capabilities were great at first, but my charging cord stopped working just over 2 months after I purchased it
5.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charge cord;This was not a fast charging cord. Took almost 24 hrs to charge a phone.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Meh;Worked for like 1-2 weeks then stopped charging. I take care of my cords pretty well at that. But I could've just gotten a bad batch of these. Idk but it didn't seem to work very well
2.0 out of 5 stars;Will not reliability stay in my phone!!;This charger works well and is a great length. The cord cover seems very durable, but any time I move my phone, the cord pops right out. Very frustrating.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good;Cheaply made
4.0 out of 5 stars;2 weeks broken;the connector slides dien now lose barely holds charge junk di not buy.
2.0 out of 5 stars;After few uses;It started falling out of my phone after few uses  and wouldn't charge the other phone at all
5.0 out of 5 stars;Needing replacement after short period;It was great for the first few months. I had high hopes for this but just like all other chargers where the plug to phone meets the wire it has internally come loose. I also have been extremely careful with this since I love how I can sit in the bed and charge while using my phone. I now have to wiggle and lay it still to charge properly now. I purchased in Dec2020 and last week it is needing replacement...good run for such a low price. Was great when it worked
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect length!;This was great for use next to my bed.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Won't stay plugged in to the phone;The length is great, but it keeps falling out of my phone. I would not recommend this product.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Absolute Bollocks;Bought this cable to charge a Samsung Note8, December 2021. In less than six months it stopped 'Fast Charging' and by July it was having difficulty just charging. Come August, I jumped through hoops trying to figure out what was wrong. Surely it wasn't this highly-rated charging cable I purchased. After attempting phone repair,, battery replacement, and just plain ending up getting a new phone... the Samsung S22 I replaced the Note8 with... didn't charge either. I had to finagle the cord connection to get it to even slow charge (10 hours from 50%?!) and finally, I knew. Finally I knew it was the cable. I ordered a new charging brick and used the USB-C to USB-C cable that came with the new phone and lo and behold... the old phone fast charged again. And the new phone fast charged.This cable does not hold up. This cable is not even worth the price of admission. This is what I get for purchasing a 'highly rated' cable at such a low cost.Let the buyer beware.
1.0 out of 5 stars;CHARGER ISN’T COMPATIBLE WITH IPAD PRO (12.9-INCH) (5th GENERATION).;While using the cord on my iPad, charging percentage wouldn’t improve. First couple of times I didn’t pay attention, until I started to use the cord while I was running apps and games, while charging the device. Plugged the cord to my device, about 30% battery life, then I’m notified 25% battery life while it was charging the whole time. I even contacted apple support to run diagnostics on my device to check up on the performance, each time I received the same answer your device is completely fine and running 100%. Then, I started to monitor my charging process while plugged, mind you I wasn’t running heavy apps. After monitoring the charging progress, I noticed the battery life would stay on the same percentage, even after receiving 30 minutes of charge, also not only wouldn’t the charge life increase but it’s percentage will actually decrease.  Wouldn’t recommend, attached the screenshot of my device being on 27% never unplugged and actually currently having 25%
5.0 out of 5 stars;Fast charging and durable.;Very fast charging. The cord is really long, which is good for the use in my car. The old charger cable  I had was not very long, so I had to disconnect the cord when I had to use the phone outside of the car vent phone mount.  Planning on getting at least one more of these for use in my home. And Amazon's delivery time was fast, as usual.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Worked great until after a handful of times, then broke;Works great. I used it on occasion with an outlet behind the couch (needed length). After a handful of uses, the plug itself that goes into the phone fell straight out. Almost zero durability. I hope it was a lemon, and not the standard for the company.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Heavy Duty Charger;The ends of this charger have some real weight, as well as the cord itself.I only hope my cell phone lasts as long as I suspect this charger will.My stupid cat won't chew on this and that was my real reason for my purchase :)
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good charger.;Good length
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great charger, Excellent customer service..;"Although I previously posted ""Worked for 2 weeks.""The seller contacted me with a resolution to resolve the issue, providing exceptional customer satisfaction. I recieved a  replacement just a few days after the seller reached out.This is a fast charger. Very durable, with a reversible charging plug port.Recommend this Seller!"
3.0 out of 5 stars;Awesome length!;I received this in September (it's now February) it's been great until now! It started to not charge my phone very fast last week... it takes hours!Now it only sometimes charges my phone completely overnight. It only gets to about 75% some nights.
5.0 out of 5 stars;So far so good;I'm happy with my charger.  It was worth it.
3.0 out of 5 stars;They didn't work for very long;I thought it was a great deal but you get what you paid for
5.0 out of 5 stars;"Have room to use tablet now long cord!;";To charge cell ph & tablet, & able to use them in my recliner is great!
5.0 out of 5 stars;This is actually useful;No more struggling to get close to an outlet to charge my phone . This cord let's me connect from across the room. It's great.
3.0 out of 5 stars;very durable tough cord!;durability & length
2.0 out of 5 stars;Lasted 2 months;Used this card for charging my phone and tablet at night while I laid in bed. Now it's spotty. Not sure if it's the length or just a bad product.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Barely any charging, good braiding;Yes I have these I like the braiding cuz it does last longer but there was issues with it I thought the 10ft was good that was way too long for me way too clumsy and the charging for me was Nat there it was not quick at all and I had to keep the charge in for a very long time just to charge the phone and that's too much and I didn't give it such a good rating and I would not recommend it in my opinion it just didn't work for me
2.0 out of 5 stars;Long cord but lasted only a couple weeks;Pros: Long cord and sturdy feelingCons: Stopped wanting to charge quickly after 2 weeks.I got this charger because I wanted a long cord. It worked great for about 2 weeks and It was fast charging, but then it started charging really slow. It says it will charge my phone in about 10 hours. I thought it was just my phone, but I tried a couple old charging cords and they worked just fine. I didn't really move or unplug it anywhere, so I don't know why it's giving me issues.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Nice!;Good product at a good price - works well. I've only been using ot now it for a few days, so I can't speak on the longevity/durability yet...
5.0 out of 5 stars;Muy bueno;Todo muy bueno y lo mjor cable largo
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nicely made, very,very tight fit on my phone.;Appears to be very well made.  Only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because of how tight the fit is into the phone.  Tighter than any of the other 4 or 5 cable I've got. Tight enough that I'm afraid it might break the tiny spade in the female portion of the plug in the phone.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Durability;Doesn’t appear to be as durable as I expected where it plugs in it already has a bend in it
4.0 out of 5 stars;Should be charged for not working!!;I bought these two times and they do not work.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Pathetic.;Photos are a comparison of my old (now broken, hence why I bought this thing to start off with) charger and the product listed here. There is a noticeable size difference between the two and if I bought the wrong type of product that's on me but last I checked type-c is still type-cWould love to be able to say it works but the damn thing is too loose to even try to fit in my phone. Really pissed cause I'm sick right now and I can't just go out and get an actual working product. Waited this long for this excuse of a charging cable. I don't know the charging power cause the plug slips right out of the port.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Like the length;I like that I can use it from different areas and it doesn't get bent
2.0 out of 5 stars;Slow;Slow charge
3.0 out of 5 stars;Plastic cover comes off;The plastic cover between the cable and the connector separated from the connector after six months of once a day connecting/disconnecting.  Not durable.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Long & Sturdy;Long chord, sturdy not easily bendable,  and durable. Chord was easy fix for the new Samsung S21s that only come with a C to C cord but no charger.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Okay;Okay
4.0 out of 5 stars;It's a power cord.  That's about it.;It's very cord-like.  Which is a good quality in a cord.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Charges my samsung;So far ni problems. It chargers my phone juag fine.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Stop working.;This charger worked great for a couple months then it just stopped working/charging my phone.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not a secure plug;The cord will not stay plugged in on the phone end.  Once connected, if you just brush by the phone, the cable drops out.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Only lasted a month;Does the job but porely made to last a long time
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good quality and value;The product arrived on time and did the job as expected
1.0 out of 5 stars;THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT SUPPORT FAST CHARGING FOR LARGE ELECTRONICS.;If you are looking to charge a tablet or anything larger than a phone (MacBook, iPad, any other tablet, etc.) DO NOT BUY THIS CABLE.I am about to return it because of this. When I bought this cable, I was looking for something to quickly charge my iPad Pro 12.9 inch. I bought an Anker power block along with it. When I first used it with the power block, it charged so slowly that my iPad continued to die if I used it while charging. Since I use my iPad frequently (I replaced my laptop with it) this does NOT work for me. I cannot stop using it in order to let it charge as I am a photographer and am sometimes editing for many hours at a time. I replaced the power block with a better, fast-charging block, thinking that was the problem. & it was part of the problem, but today I tested this cord vs. the stock USB-C to USB-C cord that came with my iPad (which is not long enough to be plugged in with I am using my iPad, that’s why I bought this damn long cord in the first place).This cord charged my iPad ONLY 1% in ten minutes using a fast-charging Anker power block. The cord that it came with it charged 11% in 10 minutes.I will be replacing with a 10 ft. USB-C to USB-C power cord. I think part of the problem is also that this cord is USB-A to USB-C which is supposedly slower than the double USB-C.Anyway, end rant. Hope this helps someone!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not high speed for me;I have one of those wireless charging pads, which charges my phone very quickly. However, I wanted to move it to a better location and needed a longer USB-C cable to accomplish this.So yeah, the cable does charge my phone when I set it on the pad, but it is no longer high speed. It charges much much slower than I’m used to. I’m not sure if it’s a compatibility issue or if this cable just isn’t high speed.As I use an iPhone X I cant test the cable without the wireless charging pad.
3.0 out of 5 stars;The charge is very slow;Cord does not charge fast
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great product;Will purchase again when necklaces
5.0 out of 5 stars;Love the length & duribility;I love how long these cords are and how durable they feel.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Best charge;I've been victim to the slow chargers and very short chargers. But this one, even with how long it is, has pretty good charging power. Charges my phone quickly and it's pretty durable
2.0 out of 5 stars;Poor quality;Cheap junk. It stopped working within two months. My phone has to be in just the right position for it to work and it says it will take 20 hours to fully charge. I tried a different charger and it worked normally, so I know the problem is the charger and not the phone. My original charger lasted almost 4 years before needing replacement.Pros: The flexible covering and cord length are nice
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not well made;Length was good when it worked charging was excellent.. it broke after about 3 weeks. It would no longer connect to phone and the shroud just came apart.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Cord pulls away from the chargern;I wondered why it stopped working and found that the fabric cord had become loose from the charger.  I still use it, though, as it works if the cord is pushed in after attaching to the phone.  A minor annoyance for now, but makes me wonder about the duration of it's usefulness.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Kinks very easy,;I like the length,  But not very happy how easy it kinks.Not sure how it effects the charging yet. If it does I will return.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Check the wrapping;I should have sent it back when I saw a slight unraveling. Now as it moves when connected to my phone it shorts in and out. There is no way to get in touch with the shipper and of course it is too late to send back. Other then that I love the length and how quickly it charges.
1.0 out of 5 stars;I do NOT recommended it!!!;The cord does not stay attached. It falls out if you barely touch it...since it has this problem the 10fy length does me no good. I cannot charge and be on my phone at the same time since this cord is janky and it falls right out of the charging hole.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Did not work for my phone.;Bought to take on a trip. It did not charge my phone. Kept saying connection error. Missed the return window but was offered a replacement or a refund.
5.0 out of 5 stars;New;Still new but works great to start with.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Non Fast Charger;Great length and durable. Lol. But it's not fast charging.
3.0 out of 5 stars;No longevity;Great charging speed with the length I ordered. Unfortunately it only lasted 6 months. Ok value.
3.0 out of 5 stars;It doesn't go to charge, says the cord is in wrong.;I love the charging power when it charges, i love the length of yhe cord. But it seems to have some issues connecting properly. Says usb not connected. Then if I wiggle it, i get a connection.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good cord but slow charge;product ok
5.0 out of 5 stars;Long cable, fast charge;Cable is durable with the braiding/wrapping.  I love the length, I can go all around most rooms with my phone still charging.  It gives me a fast charge on my Galaxy S20+My only complaint is not buying one for each room.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Long enough;I can finally sit on my couch or recliner and charge phone while using at same time.  Others were too short.  This is a good length for home.
3.0 out of 5 stars;You get what you pay for...;Poor quality.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Charging cord;The cord didn't work for long.
5.0 out of 5 stars;REALLY fast charge & sturdy cable :-);"I've bought some""fast charging"" cables in the past that actually seemed to Slow Down how quickly my phone charged, so I wasn't sure if this was actually going to charge quickly, as claimed. It does a great job! I like having 10 feet of cable to facilitate plugging in hard-to-reach places while keeping my phone near. The cable is very sturdy, and the connection to the male end is reinforced. It's also a secure fit, with no jiggling.As devices move to this connection, I'll be buying more of this specific cable.A few weeks later, and I've bought more of these for me (one for work, one for home, one to keep in my bag) and one for my coworker as a gift! Definitely a great, fast-charging cable, with enough length to get you from that hard-to-reach outlet to your comfy spot."
4.0 out of 5 stars;This cord is Long and Strong!;Hello to anyone wondering if this charger for your phone is worth it. To me it greatly did well.I have a Google Pixel 3 XL. I had basic chargers for it but didn't last long nor was the cord long enough for me but this cord made my experience so far great!10ft is really long (did not realize it till it arrived) but even though it is a long cord, my phone is still able to rapid charge through it. The cord is incredibly durable!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Durable;Durable
2.0 out of 5 stars;Great for 5 days..;this cord charged great and fast.. for 5 days before the end broke. If you are someone who charges their phone while using it, this might not be the best charging cord for you. Great option if you need it just for the bedside table.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Charging cord;Appears to be solidly built with rubber grommets at each end to resist wear and tear like other brands.
5.0 out of 5 stars;x;x
4.0 out of 5 stars;Still fast charges after 5 months;This cable is still fast charging and showing no signs of tiring after 5 months. That's more than I can say about any gas station charger, so it's easily worth the money.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped working the way it should after a month or 2. Unable to get an exchange.;The cord length was good, however it was not as durable as I had hoped. After a month or 2 there seems to be a connection issue. I have to move the cord into different positions to get it to charge my phone.
5.0 out of 5 stars;;
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good for the price & purpose;Cord length is awesome! Would have rated 5 stars but wall adapter gets warmer than anticipated when charging phone. Nonetheless, I would recommend.
4.0 out of 5 stars;A long charger;This is a relatively good charger that is quite long. I like it.
2.0 out of 5 stars;It burnt my husband's phone up;It worked well for about 3 weeks. Then out of nowhere it overheated and started smoking while my husband's phone was plugged in. It messed up his charging port and he now has to get a new phone. DO NOT BUY
3.0 out of 5 stars;takes forever to charge;takes forever to charge
3.0 out of 5 stars;Slow;This cable will charge, but it is not a fast charge  cable.. the length is good and seems durable enough, I have used it for over a year..
3.0 out of 5 stars;Will not charge with my fast adapter;My phone will not charge with this cord plus i have fast charge adapter will not charge
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not a quick charger;"Not sure if it's the whole product or I got a dud, but not only is it not a quick charger, it barely charges. I keep getting the alert on my phone ""to charge faster, use the cable provided with your phone."" It's solidly built, but just doesn't work the way I needed it to. My phone is compatible according to the list."
5.0 out of 5 stars;Surpassed my expectations;Just what I wanted.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Only 1 out of 2 works for me;"One of the two I received works just fine as expected. My phone recognized it as ""fast charging"" and it receives a full battery within thirty+/- minutes. The second cord doesn't do this. it has to be reconnected at both the USB and the phone end/port multiple times in order for my phone to admit it's receiving a ""cable charge"", which then takes about an hour and a half to charge the phone.1/2 works as expected. A little disappointed, but needed the one that actually works so I can't return."
1.0 out of 5 stars;SLOW CHARGING AFTER 3 MONTHS;Worked great for 2-3 months, then kept getting message to use charger that came with the phone, and began to only charge at about a tenth of the rate it charged the first few months. Now six months in and still at zero charge won't stay charged even while it's turned off. What a waste.
3.0 out of 5 stars;That it works;No issue
3.0 out of 5 stars;Should be moderate charger, not fast charger;Expected to get a fast charge but this charger takes longer than my old frayed wire used to. Would not recommend buying.
2.0 out of 5 stars;SAVE YOUR MONEY;It says it is fast charging if you use a fast charging block, which I used. Had it plugged in for 8 hours and the max my phone got to was 78%, how is that fast charging? My old charger took me an hour to get to 100%, waste of money do not buy!!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Handy cable;Bought this cable for a 13 hour car trip. Dad used it connected in front while he was in the back seat of my Camry. It was long enough to weave between and under seats and the console no problems
4.0 out of 5 stars;Loved them mostly;They are good. I just got one  that stopped working.  My husband  literally  loses these things all the time.  A very  good  price.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Awesome USB C;I have been looking for a 10 ft  cord and I found it! The cord is  EXTREMELY durable (as a cat and a baby have tried to destroy it and it still works great). The Type C plug fits very securely into the phone. The USB plug fits into my old rapid charger and maintains the rapid charge. I can't ask for anything more in a USB plug. Worth every penny.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Fast Charge And Long 👍🏾 Weak Connection To Port 👎🏾;The cable seemed nice when I first held it. Tight weaving makes me think it'll last a long time and it's extremely long which is also a plus.Big downside is that the cable is always disconnecting. And it won't even fall clean out of the phone. It'll come out just enough to not charge but not enough that it's clearly not charging anymore. I've came back to my phone with weak battery a bunch of times.I use other cords as well and I have no issue.Doesn't serve it's purpose good enough so I have to give only 3 stars.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Great until it stops working;I've owned two of these and both stopped working. The first one lasted probably six months, which isn't bad since it's for my young son's tablet and he's rough on equipment. The last one only lasted a few weeks. Returned it and am trying a different brand. Maybe if you're more delicate with cords than a ten year old you'll have better luck, but I'm looking for something a little more bombproof.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Okay;FEEL cheap
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great value!;Great value!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not durable, glad 2 pk.;I like the length, but first cord already not working. Why cant someone come up with a cord design that doesn't disappoint.
4.0 out of 5 stars;I'd buy again;I've bought this charger twice. I would say it lasts about 4 months before I needed to buy another one not sure how well that compares to others but I love how long it is
2.0 out of 5 stars;Low to no power;I bought this for my bedroom since my outlet is so far away from my bed, used it 2 nights. And in 2 nights I might have gotten the only bad chord.Used on a galaxy s 10 note + no issues with charging my phone, my old charger works betterNight 1 - chord had little to no energy and said it would take 3 hours to be fully charged  from my phone being on 27%Where as my old one stated it would take 1 hourNight 2- charging cable did not register,  and was not charging the phone I had to unplug and plug it into my phone mult times for it to register. Charging time improved to 2 h 22m fully charged from 20%
2.0 out of 5 stars;.phones Samung on work doesn't It;phone the into them plug can You .work does
3.0 out of 5 stars;Slow;For the first few days it charged fast but after that? Slow. Takes ALL DAY for my phone to charge to 100% now.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Broke in first month.;Didn't last
2.0 out of 5 stars;Shit charger, stopped working after only a month of use;It won't charge my phone fully at night anymore and it's only been a month since I got it. Do not waste your money. The last charger I had lasted up to 7 months, so companies are clearly capable of making better working chargers. They just make them cheap to waste your money. Do not buy.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Chords do not fit charging port properly;I purchase two of these cords for charging my phone at different places in my house. Although the cords charge really well. They do not stay in the phone the cord falls out of the charging port with little movement. I will not purchase them again. Very dissatisfied!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Charger;I charges sometime fast and then it get slow. Yes it's the first charger for my phone.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Didnt make the cut;It was nice while it lasted.  I ordered it in February of 2021. By june 2021 it quit charging my phone. Tried messing with cord but was too unreliable to continue use. The length was both convenient and inconvenient as it was nice when ur outlet is a ways off and not so great when ur outlet is close. Either way, sorry it didn't make it.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Kinda flimsy.;Was pretty good for a month or so, then it stopped working.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Charging issues;I was disappointed because it didn't last long stop charging
4.0 out of 5 stars;Gives me room to charge my phone and not sit next to an outlet;I was surprised that it didn't come with a plug. I did have an extra and was able to charge my phone.I did like the color and style. 10 feet gives me options to use away from an outlet next to me.
3.0 out of 5 stars;6 months already useless;It's just a cord... I'm very careful, still use the tie it came with... my phone signals cord is badNext
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works OK;A bit slow, but works ok
3.0 out of 5 stars;Won't last for just anyone.;I bought this for my 9yr old. He likes to watch videos and charger. Normal charger was to short for his tablet. And the longer one wasn't a rapid so it didn't charge enough while he was in YoiTube. I loved the rapid charge but it didn't last more than two months. Yes I'm going to try some electrical tape. If this is for the normal adult it will last but for a child..not long.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Low durability;After less than 10 months of standard bedside use, the cable will now not provide power unless I hold the very tip at a precise angle where it goes into the device. This happens for both a phone and tablet, which each charge fine using other cables.  This is the second cable of this type to quit working, the fancy outer sheath is all for show. Very poor durability. I won't order this brand again.
5.0 out of 5 stars;GOOD;Good
3.0 out of 5 stars;not working;the charger is not working. doesn’t charge at all.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging compatible;Not fast charging cord. The cord I brought at the dollar tree charged faster then this cord. The length is great but thats about it.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Cable doesn'e work after 2 weeks;I bought this for my father to use in his hospital room. It stopped charging yesterday. I tried different charging plugs also. Buyer beware.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Possible fire hazard;After only 5 months moderate usage it nearly caught fire.Charged overnight in the same spot I usually do. Nothing on top of or under phone no nearby heat sources and it was a cool night. In the 50s with the thermostat at ~69 degreesGot hot enough to burn my finger enougn to be sensitive hours later and it was smoking a little. The outlet and my phone were operating normally. Thankfully the charging port on my phone and battery seem to have sustained no meaningful damage. Phone is a 2 year old Galaxy S10lite. Never gets more then faintly warm charging normally.The cord is a nice length but cannot recommend this due to the safety hazard and not supporting fast charging well. If you absolutely must purchase this only use attended in a cool room far from any heat sources on a flat surface ideally with the charger port having slightly off the side to maximize heat venting from the phone/port.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good;Length is just right
3.0 out of 5 stars;Was great until it stopped charging right;The length, charging power are all great, it feels durable but a week in I noticed it stopped charging right, had to move it into a certain position for it to charge again, basically doesn't work anymore, someone I know has a similar or the same one and it's lasted him forever tho
3.0 out of 5 stars;Doesnt connect well.;When plugged into my phone its very lose and wiggles around. Prevent my phone from fast charging. Recommend a different cable than this one.
5.0 out of 5 stars;It reaches;It is long
5.0 out of 5 stars;Best Cord Ever!;"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I love that fact that it's thick and durable. It charges really fast! Fits nicely in my phone. The 10' length let's me plugged in most anyway."
3.0 out of 5 stars;Misleading description -These are NOT fast charging;Not at all as described - These are NOT fast charging
4.0 out of 5 stars;It is once again easy to charge our tablet;Does do just what it says it will do.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Enjoy it while it lasts;Because if it was like mine, that’s about a month. Try again, tech users.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Okay;The fit isn’t tight enough for my phone and you have to try and twist or bend the cord to make it charge the phone.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Decent USB C  cable;Does not allow rapid charge but does charge faster than conventional cords of its type
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great product;Great product
2.0 out of 5 stars;Breaks Easy;I've gone through several of these. They are nice and long. If you just plug in your phone and set it down these are fine but if you use your device like I do, they break quickly.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Broken and stopped working after 4 months;Not durable. It has been in one place and gently handled but still the end came apart and it doesn't charge anymore. Skip this purchase. Bad news.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Only 1 of my 2 cords work;Charges fast but sadly I paid for two and only one of them work.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great Product !!;For A Gift works Great !!!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Will Not Last;The charger worked well for a couple months but then slowed its charger and eventually stopped charging completely.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Love it.  Thanks;Love
5.0 out of 5 stars;attractive and functional;I did not realize this cord would be so long and I love that I can plug it in and have full use of my item all over the room!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Bought two;I bought two one works great the other on the other hand does not
2.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped working after a month;I absolutely love the length of these chords, but after a month they completely stopped working on my phone. Both of them!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Will not connect to my phone correctly or something!;I purchased in January bc my other cable was starting to act up and wanted to have one on hand. We'll fast forward to March and I've only used this cable a couple of weeks and it won't hook up to my phone probably to charge correctly and this cable is the only cable I have issues with so I know it is the cable. Have another brand on the way.
4.0 out of 5 stars;No need to buy multiple cords;Liked the fact that I did not have to buy multiple cords as I only needed the one.  10 ft is a bit long but worth the trade off
5.0 out of 5 stars;Charger replacement...;It fits in my tablet perfectly and charges good. I'm glad that I found a cord to charge it with since I lost the charger that came with it in the first place. It was also a good and affordable price. Thanks...
5.0 out of 5 stars;great charger;love this charger
3.0 out of 5 stars;Why I only have it three stars ......;"It's a very good charger that gives off great charge and great cord length (even though I could use a longer one) but I purchased two and one of the cords didn't work, as if it was already used and they gave me a defective one. Still haven't heard back from  ""company"" about my purchase or how to get another one???? Other then that, it's a reasonable priced charger."
3.0 out of 5 stars;Its not very fast;I dont know if its because I just got it, or if it needs to adjust to being used, but it takes a long time to charge my phone. It is very long, which is good, but thats kinda useless if it takes forever to charge.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good at first, then kind of average.;At first, this charged super fast! Now, it'll sometimes unplug from my phone by itself and I have to reconnect it, and doesn't charge fast anymore. My first one barely lasted a couple of months. My second one has lasted four, but I'm not too optimistic about it going too much longer.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice;Unlike the length but it charges slowly
3.0 out of 5 stars;It has the length but won't last.;The cord is long enough to have plugged from wall to bed. But recently the cord is behaving like it has a shortage in the wire. The cord is never bent or tangled it just sits in one spot. I only had the cord a couple of months. Now I have to replace it.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works in Galaxy 8s and lg Stylo 6.cell;I like itWork with Galaxy 8s and lg Stylo 6Charging perfect
2.0 out of 5 stars;Fast charging is the first to go;I bought this hoping that the positive reviews would match the product, they don't. It was fine at first, but within 10 days the fast charging feature decided to just stop working. I am a Healthcare worker so this feature is important because I can't just sit somewhere and let my phone charge the standard way. Based on the other reviews, I should expect this product to die within the next month or so, and I don't have much free time to do a return. Very disappointed and not sure what to do next.Edit: it has been one day since the original review, and after reading others, I have since investigated more and found out that the cord is not standard charging, it is slow charging. My phone reads it as USB charging, which is the same type as plugging it into a laptop.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Failed after a few months;The plug no longer sits properly in my phone so does not charge. Occasionally it works if I wiggle it around a bit. Very disappointed in the lack of durability.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works Well;Works well. Little hard to plug into my Samsung Galaxy. Doesn't come with a USB /AC adapter to plug into the electrical outlet.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Worked great for the first month;I bought this because I read it was durable and I liked the length. And for the first month, it worked like a charm. But just after its return date, it started to charge so slowly (6+ hours for a full recharge??). Really disappointed with this purchase.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Life changing;Love this 10' cord.my 20 year old son said this long ccord would be life changing. It is! I can move about abit or roll over if in bed without unplugging. It is a bit tough to get it completely plugged into my phone. However, that also means that it doesn't fall out eiasily!r or disconnect if I bump it. My kids both want them now too!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Didn't last;I bought this because I liked the length of the cord and the product had okay reviews. I expected this to last at least a few months, like any other cheap cord I purchase. However, this started to deteriorate after only 2 weeks, only allowing a charge when plugged in at a certain angle in the port, and then the little  silver plastic piece at the end fell off about a week later. It now no longer works at all after a month. I only used this once or twice daily in the same plug so it definitely wasn't wear and tear.
5.0 out of 5 stars;It works;It's works
1.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped working after ONE DAY;I have a cord just like this that works great, so I ordered another for my living room. It worked okay (but didn't fast charge) for one day, and now it charges my phone extremely slowly for 5 seconds before not charging anymore. It behaves like a 2 year old charger thats falling apart, so it can sometimes charge if you hold it at the perfect angle, but the second it moves a fraction of an inch, it stops charging. I threw out the packaging so I can't even return it to get a new one. I definitely wouldn't buy from this seller again.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Endurance and stability!;I bought two of these cables because I use my tablet for both reading and games as well as the internet. The cables that came with my tablet and phone aren't really long enough. The 10 foot length enables me to sit comfortably on my sofa or in bed without having to worry about pulling the cable out. I also like that it is sturdy and will ensure over time.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped working properly;Both cables were working fine, after a few months I would say 4 months they stopped working. Takes 6+ hours to charge, it's suppose to he a fast charging cable
3.0 out of 5 stars;The charger worked really well for a while;Hello, I reviewed this charger on April,28,2021 and it started to give me problems around June 3 so it lasted about a month. Now whenever I try to use it, it has to be at a certain angle. But back when it did work, it worked great! And it used to charge fast.
4.0 out of 5 stars;nothing;good length,easy to use
3.0 out of 5 stars;Great cord;It works really well
5.0 out of 5 stars;Used for about week and works great!;I can't complain. Order came sooner than expected.  The length is perfect! It supports quick charging for my s10.  The price was reasonable.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't  last long;I love the length but is not durable  , I have brought this item several times none have lasted longer than 3 months
3.0 out of 5 stars;Cheaply made;I probably had this cord a few weeks now, and already the aluminum covering that protects the wires already came off. I had to tape it in order for it to stay in place.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Charger;Sturdy
2.0 out of 5 stars;Short life;I bought this charger for use in the hospital since those plugs aren't conveniently placed for the patients and the last thing you want to be worrying about is where your phone is, how to get to it or if there is enough power when sharing photos of your new babies. This charger started out great but over the course of the 2 months I've had it it has stopped charging as quickly and my USB C devices only recognize it intermittently.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Stops charging your phone a week after u get them! 2nd one...never again;Horrible ..
1.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped working after 3 months;It worked well for 3 months. But is broken now.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Very durable;I have a KYOCERA phone and this is not compatible with it. But for a phone where this is compatible it is very sturdy.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Just what I needed;I needed a long phone charger / cable for my work phone when I am on call.This is just what I needed.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charging;"I ordered this for the length, which is great, but find that when I connect I often get a message about ""slow charging"" and ""incompatibility"" estimating 20 hours to fully charge. Last night, I charged all night and woke up to only 65% battery life."
1.0 out of 5 stars;Disappointed (lasted 3 weeks);I went through a lot of reviews to decide on this cord. I have to start by acknowledging that I am somewhat rough with the cords (I plug my phone in at night when I go to bed and watch stuff plus play simple games), but the reviews were good for that. After the first week or so, it started giving me the error that my phone was charging slowly. I don't get my cables for fast charging, but when the error message is constant, I worry about it messing up the battery. It might be worth noting that I never got a fast charge out of this on my phone (although it did work on my headphones, which I leave alone to charge during the day while I am at work).I finally decided to do the review when I woke up to my phone only at 3% since it hadn't charged at all overnight. I am used to buying cords every few months. This cord only lasted 3 weeks. Total waste. I think if you're a person who leaves your electronics alone while charging, it's fine. Otherwise, I don't recommend it at all.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good Charger;This charger works well with my phone!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Let down;Worked wonderfully until a few days ago. Now charges slowly or not at all. I'm so disappointed because I was very happy with it  Return/exchange window is closed, of course. Just ordered a replacement from a different brand. Wish this would have lasted longer than three months.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Quit working;Quit charging my phone. Had to replace it.
4.0 out of 5 stars;durable;long cord is great for charging at home
5.0 out of 5 stars;Sturdy, charges fast and was cheap to buy!;This is a sturdy cord, doesn't bend easily to be broken.  It's really long so you can plug it in to charge and still use it comfortably. It charges as fast as the cord that came with the phone.  Great price!
2.0 out of 5 stars;It quit working effectively after two months.;The cable sat in the same place and was never moved.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Great Length takes longer to charge devices applicable for the C charger;is not a speed charger for Samsung devices
2.0 out of 5 stars;Didn't last!!;Loved the length of this cord. Worked beautifully for one month. That's it!  It just stopped charging.  Its true...you get what you pay for.Now,  I need to buy something else, again!  Very disappointed in this product.Which one last the longest?
5.0 out of 5 stars;"For me its ""Perfect.""";The Length is ideal for my use.  No more sitting or standing near an electrical outlet waiting for my phone to charge while I'm trying to talk. The versatility can be endless.  The cord is made up of a strong material.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Durable but didn’t work long;Was excited about having it and it stopped charging the device in less than a week. Obviously not too happy about that.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Fell short on durability;After about 1 week the metal tip that connects to the phone charging port just fell off and now is unusable. Didn't spend much for them but still money down the drain in my experience.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Seems sturdy;It's a thicker cord than our last braided charging cord. It doesn't bend at the base of the connector so it feels like it will last a lot longer. It's an attractive color and it works. Not much else to say about it.. it's a charging cord and it works. 🤷🏻‍♀️
2.0 out of 5 stars;Galaxy S10+ rejected cord periodically after a few weeks.;After a few weeks, having trouble with Galaxy S10+ accepting cord.  Sometimes it won't charge right away.  So far I've been able to fiddle with it and get a charge.The durability of the cord is great as is the length.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great length!;So for so good with this cord.  It works with my fast charging port so I have no complaints!!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Awesome for 6 months - purchased again;I purchased the same charger about 6 months ago. It's actually a really great charger... for that amount of time. After that, it stopped working unless you wrapped the cord completely around the phone and posed it in strange positions. I like the charger enough to repurchase though!
2.0 out of 5 stars;defective cord;cord doesn't charge properly
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great Purchase.;Works just as described. Very sturdy and fast charge.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Their great;Like them very much
4.0 out of 5 stars;long and sturdy cord;I just needed a replacement and this one was longer than most. It feels extra durable and so far I'm very happy!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Long enough;Its long enough!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Longer ir is less power it has;It was ok
2.0 out of 5 stars;Super SLOW charging;I have a samsung Galaxy S20. This cable does not charge fast at all! At 20% my phone estimated 26 hours before fully charged. Unacceptable and misleading.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Broken;Great charging power but opened the package and the end of the cord was already broken.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Priced just right. Strong and sturdy 10 foot type C cord. Amazing.;This is among the best charging cords I’ve EVER purchased. It’s so strong and sturdy. Started fast charging immediately. Bought Type C, now have to check if they make one for IPhone 7 Plus. Great buy at a great price. Ten foot cord, WOW.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Love it;Love it
3.0 out of 5 stars;Mehh.. good while it lasted.;It served it's purpose for a very brief time and then just quit working.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Muy bueno 👌 gracias!!;Solo gracias 🙂 😊!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped working after a few months;"I loved this cord so much back when I got it a few months ago! I'm not sure what happened though, all of a sudden it isn't working. My phone keeps saying ""check your charger connection."" Maybe I got a faulty one. But when it was working, it was a gem! Have to use my old phone charger now."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good cord;So far so good 10 ft and seems very sturdy. For the price well worth it
4.0 out of 5 stars;Durable cable.;So far connection is great.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good charging power;Charging power is good
3.0 out of 5 stars;Worked great for about a week then quit working.;I loved it till it quit working.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Cable efficiency;Arrived quickly, works well and fair price
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not happy with this product;It just keeps making a noise when it's plugged in and I don't like that. I'm sure it's not supposed to be that way
2.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't last long;I waited to write this review purposefully so I could determine if these would work long term, they did not.  Neither charger works now and both stay in the same location all the time.  They aren't ripped or frayed so definitely durable but no longer charge.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Type C charger;Good quality!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good product;So far so good.
2.0 out of 5 stars;It doesn't seem to stay connected to charge. Other chargers do, so I don't think it's the phone.;The media could not be loaded.
3.0 out of 5 stars;I Love the length of this charger.;I love the length .
1.0 out of 5 stars;Worked for one year, now is junk.;Went dead almost exactly one year after purchase with careful, minimal usage. Amazon says to contact the seller with problems but of course any contact info for this seller is hidden and buried. No way to contact them. Horiible.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Stop working;After a year of use the cable no longer charge any of my phones.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't stay plugged in you have to hold it;Crap explains it all
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good;Does the job. Reasonable price.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't hold up;Upon arrival, one of the 3 chargers I ordered did not do fast charge. 3 months later, another doesn't charge at all. The 3rd one has held up so far, but who knows how long it will last.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice charging cord, always nice to have a longer cord;So far so good,  it charges faster than I expected.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Works great for a few months then stops working;Worked great, the length was great, it did fast charging.  It has unexpectedly stopped working after 4 months. There is no damage to the cord, it was only used to charge the phone nightly.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great quality phone charger;This charger charges my phone from dead to 100% in less than 30 minutes. I'm happy with the charging power but happiest with the length and quality, I take it everywhere.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Great length;Great length but this is not the charger for me.  It tool 6 hours for my phone to charge when it usually charges less than an hour.  Fast charging should not be included in the description at all.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Longer cord and faster charges!;Have a lot more leeway using my phone while it was charging. The manufactured cord is a little on the short side. Charges a lot faster as well. Great product!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Charging;Cable sucked it was loose fitting and would come slowly slide out from being plugged in
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great cable.;Loved it and it never broke at the plug or degraded in charging speed.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Only lasted 3 months and stopped working.;one day it worked, the  next day it didn't.  will reorder and see how long the next one lasts.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Seems strong but time will tell;Ok for what it does
3.0 out of 5 stars;Worked at first, will not charge now;Worked fine for about a couple months and was a fast charger. Now it doesn't work to charge my phone. This is the second one I have purchased because I loved how fast it charges and the long chord. Disappointed and tired of having to repurchase.
2.0 out of 5 stars;If your look for long term charger ? This is not It!! Not At All!!;This item was good from the start it charged real fast and seem to be very sterdy.. after a Few weeks of use it made it harder & harder to get my phone charged  fully ..it charged very very slow..and now takes all day to charge.  This is just down right wrong to make is have to keep buying to get a quicker more sturdy  charge..to have to have your phone on the charger all day just sucks. This charger is just not worth the long hall must less 3 -4 weeks. Than becomes a dud..that works very very slowly. smh. This is not the charger for anyone..js 😡
2.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped Working;"The charger worked fine for about two months and now has to be plugged in and taken out about three times before it actually charges my phone. Every time I plug it in, my phone gives me a pop-up saying ""check your connection"" and won't charge or fast charge until I try plugging it in at least two more times. It's cheap for a reason."
2.0 out of 5 stars;Extremely slow charging;Only worked well for about a week, it now charges extremely slow (5 hours compared to 1 normally) and my phone tells me to check the connection every time. Highly disappointed and would not recommend unless you only need it as a back up and for length.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good cable;It seems to be a good charging cable.  No complaints.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Fast charging worked for about 2 months.;Cable worked great when I first got it. After about 2 months the fast charging stopped working. My galaxy s8 went from charging in 1hr 30 minutes to taking over 5 hours to charge. I've since replaced this cable with one that actually works properly.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Worked good for awhile;I bought 2 cords back February 2021....one of them stopped working. When it worked.  It worked well....for the price it's a steal...just wish it was a little more durable.
2.0 out of 5 stars;NOT AS ADVERTISED;I purchased the cable do to the fact it was advertised as a fast charger....IT IS BY NO MEANS THAT!Yes it works but not fast at all......It has a long cord which is nice, and seems to be made relatively well.I have a new Note 20 ultra 5g...and at 50% it took over 2 hours to charge to 100%This was supposed to be a  spare charger for work .....but this cable just wont do for me.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Extra Long Cord;Just what I ordered.  A durable 10ft cord for my Samsung phone.  My phone went directly into fast charging.  The cord is currently working great!
2.0 out of 5 stars;2 months and done;I bought this is March. It worked great until about a month ago then it started charging super slow.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Quit working after about a week;I’m getting another one hoping for a different outcome, but the first one I bought quit working after less than a week. It’s decently cheap, so I didn’t expect it to last forever. But a bit disappointed so far.
1.0 out of 5 stars;No fast charging after <2 months;Up until the last couple weeks, I loved this cord. Great length, durable cord, and fast charging. However, in the last couple weeks, it's started throwing up this error message, and it no longer fast charges.I tried it with multiple phones, and none of them charge quickly anymore (it used to be -at least- twice as fast). In fact, they barely even manage to charge if I am actively using my phone (though it at least helps reduce the power consumption). And they take several hours for a full charge. I tried multiple wall outlets, and I'm using the fast charging base that came with my phone. All the same result. There are rare, short instances when it fast charges, but that's happened maybe once since this started to become a thing about two weeks ago. And blowing sharply in the end to remove any possible dust or debris doesn't seem to make any difference.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good;Good
2.0 out of 5 stars;Quit after 6 weeks;This cord was great at first. Had it plugged in by my bed and used it at night. Slowly started seeing longer charge times. Now it won't charge at all and of course right outside of the return window. It's not the phone because if I switch chargers it charges fast.
5.0 out of 5 stars;STRONG cord and safe.;Thick cord. Safety bracket for cord input.  Reaches far electrical socket.  I can tell this will last long time. Well worth the money.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped working in less than a year.;Worked great at first. Loved the length. Then it started slowing charge speed then not working at all.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Shortage Already;I only had this charger for a few months and already there is a shortage.  Had to go and buy a new cord from somewhere else.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Great until after the warranty;This is the 2nd cord that I bought.  The first one stopped working about 6 weeks after the warranty. I wasn't that careful with it, so I bought another one. This one I was extremely careful to not to bend or even the phone while in use. However,  this one lasted only 3 months after the warranty.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Is a great cord;Love it!!!In the hospital right now and having a 10 ft cord is awesome as outlets are not very close by.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Extra length;Just what I need to get to the floor charger and be able to move around
2.0 out of 5 stars;Doesnt work x2;I purchased this..it stopped working within weeks.Returned it for another one and the same thing occurred. These SHOULD last for a few yers,not weeks or months!The cable doesnt stay snug into the portal.Very disappointed...twice
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not durable with normal use;Bought in mid-Feb, worked great for a few weeks each before they started shorting out. Length as described, fast charged until they broke. I don't use them roughly, so I guess they're just poorly made.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works fast;Very sturdy
3.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charger;Well I needed a longer cored for my phone. I got it and it was the slowest charger I could. So I went back to my regular cord it was so much more speedy.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Only lasted a few weeks;I loved it when it first arrived. It looks good, worked great and the length was wonderful. Unfortunately after just a couple of weeks it has already started to go bad.  While there is no visible damage, when I use it now it charges very slowly and I get an error message on my phone telling me this is due to cable damage.  I have swapped out the cable with others and it does appear to be the cable. Too bad. I liked it while it lasted.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Bad quality;The length is helpful, but the charger only charges about 50% of the time. It was fine in the beginning, but after a couple months it's just terrible. It constantly disconnects, charges incredibly slowly, and sometimes it doesn't even charge at all. I don't recommend.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Love It!;The length is great and the longest ones I have.  The cord and input are sturdy.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Did what it should;I liked that it was a sturdy, and reliable product. It suited my immediate needs, and I would definitely purchase from this seller again.
4.0 out of 5 stars;X;X
5.0 out of 5 stars;Must have;These are great and I've had for a year and they still work perfectly. I love the different sizes, I keep one at home, one for office and one for car, it's a great deal and worth it so I'm not constantly taking chargers with me everywhere.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great product;Like it a lot.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Durable and fast!!;Very durable and my son is very hard on his chargers. Fast charger unlike other cords I've used.
4.0 out of 5 stars;It works;Works well.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Fast charging;Fast charging
2.0 out of 5 stars;Poor quality? Faulty? Who knows?;Had a 10 ft Belkin that was stolen, that was like 2 years ago, and worked perfectly.Out of the package the fast charging would never work with this cable, using the OME charging block, it will trickle charge my phone, but that's it. I'm way outside of the return window, but I just couldn't be bothered to return it.Reading other reviews, I'm not the only one to have this issue. Usually I'm just too busy to leave reviews, so buy at your own risk.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Already broken;"It has been less than two weeks and this charger is already falling apart. While it's plugged in, the smallest movement of my phone brings up that ""check your charger connection"" notification. My phone has died in the middle of the night before because I plugged this charger in but nudged the phone wrong and the connection broke. And it's not the outlet or my phone that's the issue. Other outlets and other chargers work fine."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Ok;Ok
3.0 out of 5 stars;Amazon;It seems Amazon has been scamming people labeling items as new, when they have clearly been used. This is the second item I’ve purchased from Amazon that’s clearly been used. Very disappointing. Other than that, does what it’s supposed to
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works great;A little longer than I needed,,  but didn’t want 2 six foot chargers
1.0 out of 5 stars;It doesn't charge for me.;I have not had this cord for long. I purchased it in July 2022. Already the first week in August the cord does not charge or it takes 3 or 4 time as long as it normally should take to charge! Usually my replacement charging cords lasts 10 months to a year or longer. From here on out, I will purchase my charging cords directly from the manufacturer or the cell phone store. I need to be able to charge my phone whenever I need too.
5.0 out of 5 stars;a cord to replace all cords;the quantity is very good charges your phone very quick
1.0 out of 5 stars;This charger couldn't last a month what a shame;This product was literally sitting inside it's package for 2 weeks because I have extra cables and always order extra when I know one is about to got out. So after finally taking it out of its packaging and using it for 3 weeks or so the charger just stopped charging fast and would say it will take 4 hrs and 30 minutes just from 40% charge to fully charge. Worst purchase I made when trusting that this braided cable was actually better than most other chargers. I have had chargers stop working on me before for both iOS and android but this one didn't even last a month. This chargers on Amazon are starting to become the same as the ones 7 Eleven and Bartell Drugs and Walgreens sell on their shelves for twice the price. I honestly recommend that anyone that doesn't have wireless charging should invest in that and save you the headache of wasted money, time, energy. This sellers need to stop selling this junk cables to people and stop calling it fast charging or lighting fast charge.
4.0 out of 5 stars;very long cord;very good. long cord and very robust
1.0 out of 5 stars;Fall Out I Cannot Recommend;I don't exactly know why this keeps falling out of the C fitting on my Samsung cell phone, but not one other cord has ever fallen out. This just repeatedly falls out. It might be that the cord is too heavy. But I rarely give a DO NOT Recommend rating but I am forced to give this a poor review. I am sorry.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Was good until it wasn't.;At first it was a good chord. Loved the length and the ability to move around with it. Thats why it's not getting a 1-star rating.HOWEVER, the wire now has a short right at the base of the part that plugs into my phone, and if I move the chord or my phone ever so slightly, it stops charging. I'll sometimes wake up in the morning and my phone battery is on 20%. Very frustrating considering this charger is supposed to be durable. I can also see fibers from the chord fraying as well. Hope the company can make this right and maybe send a replacement.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not working;I got it right before Christmas now end of march so 3 months and its not charging. i have to pull it up and at an angle to work. plus it takes hours and hours to even move 20%. its already bad in 3 months!
2.0 out of 5 stars;What the actual F***;So I purchased this cord in May and it worked perfectly. A month later, it just randomly stopped working...it was in perfect condition, not even one kink or frayed fiber. I messaged and they sent me another cord. Well I've been using that for about a month and guess what...this one stopped working. I've had my Anker cord for 2 years now and it is perfectly fine. I have no idea why this cord only is lasting me a month and then dying. Good luck to everyone else.
5.0 out of 5 stars;I love them;The cord length is perfect
1.0 out of 5 stars;The length was great, cord didn't work long;Fast delivery, the length is great, the cord worked for a month then it wouldn't charge anymore. I didn't think it would last long so I kinda expected it from a cheap.I was hoping I would be wrong about it not lasting wrong😞
2.0 out of 5 stars;Won't charge completely.;Nice long cord does no good,  if it won't charge completely.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Wish i could return this;Love the length but seriosuly have only had this a little over  a month and now it wont charge my phone. Im so annoyed. Cive barely used it.  Only used constant the last 4 days for my hospital stay.  And its not working properly any more.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Does not correctly fit Port;I really wanted to like this cuz I love the look I love the length however I got a USBC and it keeps falling out of my phone there's not a solid contact into my phone port
3.0 out of 5 stars;Charging;It worked great for 2 weeks then all of a sudden I get a error on the phone telling me to use the correct charger and now its a slow charge. Im not sure what happend all of a sudden.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't charge my phone right & the silver thing moves the adapter part;Disliked
2.0 out of 5 stars;Begins to lose charging capability quickly;I actually had to replace this cord recently because after a few months, I would start getting an error message on my phone saying to check the connection because it's charging slowly. Now it's happening again and I haven't even had the replacement for a full month. Meanwhile, other charge cords that fit my phone work without issue so I know it's not anything with my phone port. Avoid this brand at all costs.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Only lasts 6 months;When I first got this charger on June 11th it was great. It has been 6 months and the charger started to charge weird about a week or two ago. I plugged my phone in at 3 am today it was at 15% and when I woke up at 11 am my phone was at 9% I have had the charger on for about 20 minutes now and it is at 36% however, I will likely have to buy a new charger soon. I bought this charger hoping it would last, but the original charger for my Galaxy S9 lasted for almost a year whereas this one lasted hardly over 3 months.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Great for a few months;"Worked well for a few months and then almost completely stopped charging my LG phone. If im watching any videos the battery literally depletes faster than its being charged. Now it only ""charges"" if I keep the cord in a super particular position. Time to shop for a new charger, ugh."
4.0 out of 5 stars;I like the charger very much;I like it its long enough
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great charging cable;I'm a repeat customer. My kittens had discovered our stock Samsung chargers and have been killing them. These seem to dissuade them from chewing and the extra length is nice!
4.0 out of 5 stars;charger;So far this has been the one that lasted the longest. Only had a few months but after a few months with others, it seems this one is more durable. Will let you know in another few months if it still works.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Short-lived excellence;I have loved this cable because it was long enough to reach from the outlet, didn't get kinked, and charged quickly. So when it started acting finicky a couple weeks ago I was ready to reorder another....certain that this one was a couple years old. Sadly, I was mistaken...I bought it a mere 5 months ago!When it worked it was great, but shortlived.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Waste of money;Worked well in the beginning but then just intermittently it at all. Would have returned but spent three weeks in hospital and time was out
2.0 out of 5 stars;Lasts a few months and then it's a problem. P;Charging power diminished after 5 months. Same exact timing as previous one. Gret. Then.. .Sucks.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good value;It charges great
2.0 out of 5 stars;Stop working after a few months.;Failed at the connector to the phone
2.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't last long, don't buy;I bought this cable at the end of January, and not even a month into using it I got a slow charging warning on my phone. Don't know if that's a defect or if it's common but I wouldn't recommend this for anyone looking for a longer length cable.
4.0 out of 5 stars;A great buy!;A great product!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Takes Way Too Long;This charger takes overnight to charge my Samsung Galaxy X9 phone.  With my in car charger, the same phone only takes 40 minutes to fully charge!!  My old  (lost) wall outlet charger took 1.25 hours to fully charge this phone.  This charger is totally unsatisfactory.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Charging;It doesn't charge as fast as it should. It takes about 3 hours for our phone(s) to completely charge.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Inconsistent Charging after 2 months;About 2 months into having this charger the cord is messing up. It causes disturbances in the consistency of charging.  Charger cord goes off and on back and forth. Nice that it is 10 feet. Disappointed that it has stopped working properly so quickly.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Charger would not stay in my phone;Charger would not stay in my phone
5.0 out of 5 stars;Met all expectations;I like the length, charging power and the cord is well made which means good durability and no buyers remorse.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not Very Durable;I don't know if I was too rough with it or what but this charger didn't last very long before it stopped charging effectively. I had it for a month maybe two before it quit quick charging then it stopped charging altogether unless I moved the cable around a bit. However, it did manage to quickly charge my phone when it still worked so that deserves a star I suppose. Overall not a very great product. 3/10 wouldn't recommend.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Charges slower after a few days;When I first bought this it worked fine, but after a few days it charges slower and slower. My phone used to charge from 0 to 100% in 2 hours but now it takes 3 or more hours.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great;It's very durable and is great. Better than my shorter cable, since it was about to be broken soon! Thank you!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Demasido lento;Carga muy lento, tarda muchas horas para cargar un aparato. La verdad no vale la pena.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Start out great but has already stop working after 1 month.;Liked the length but it stopped charging after a month.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Cable;It is a charging cable. No clue if it will be durable.
2.0 out of 5 stars;"Lengthy but not a viable ""fast charger"" cable";Wire is sturdy and long, but stopped fast-charging within a couple weeks. Then the little metal/plastic piece that acts as a guard fell off. Would not recommend buying... Just fork out the extra money to get the official fast charger from your local phone store, because it's worth the investment.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Nice long charge cable;Fast shipping,  appears to be built good, nice and long
2.0 out of 5 stars;Works for maybe a few days;I loved this cord when I first started using it, then a day or so later the covering started to come off and it became super finicky with charging. this is after a week of having it and it doesn't charge at all anymore unless it's in a super exact position (which isn't easy to maintain). so basically, doesn't work and it's a nuisance.don't buy.
4.0 out of 5 stars;I would highly recommend;Very nice an sturdy
2.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't Fast Charge;Bought this cable in June. Starting in November it would only slow charge my device every so often while every other cord in my house would fast charge. It's January and it will only slow charge my Note9. Waste of money. Hasn't even been a year and I'm looking for a cord to replace it with.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not worth your money;I revived my order on Sunday and decided to put this cord to use immediately. I was at 25% and charged it all night just to wake up to my phone being at 37%.Again, I tried the following night (yesterday) and it did the same thing.Waste of money, a charger that can’t charge.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Fast charger;Works great
5.0 out of 5 stars;Game changer;Now I just need to order 5 more!  It is so nice not to have to arrange furniture around a charging device.  Makes charging and using at the same time simple
2.0 out of 5 stars;They work, but..;The plugs are long on the end and just don't fit in certain places, such as a dash cam or my phone because of the very small phone cover I use.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Did not last very long;I expected to use this cord much longer than a month. Waste of money
2.0 out of 5 stars;Worked well for 3 months before it stopped charging;It did the job for 3 months that before it stopped charging my phone. Id recommend buying a different one
2.0 out of 5 stars;Only lasted 3 months before loose;Looked so sturdy. Ordered in September and by late December it is already loose in my devices.  It needs to be propped up at just the right angle to charge efficiently.  When your devices say about 70% charged but it will take more than 8 hours to charge there is something loose in the charger.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Finicky;The charger doesn't fit well and constantly quits charging. The length and the cord build are perfect but it's not a good charger if it can't charge. I let it sit on the charger an entire night and it only charges to 25-30%.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn’t charge well;The cord length is great, but it just does not charge well. Bought this for my sons Amazon fire kids tablet and it seems to be loose in the charging port. Only charges when it’s plugged in just right and even then, will do a spotty charge. I do not recommend
2.0 out of 5 stars;Great at the start, didn't last.;I broke my other charger so I bought this. It worked amazingly when I first got it, but after a few days, it wouldn't stay in my phone and lost its charging power.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charge;I've had issues with the cord since day one. Besides from the slow charging I like how long the cord is.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Customer service is great;4months in and it has stopped working..Update: customer service reached out and sent a replacement
2.0 out of 5 stars;Cable broke at connector;Used this cable at my bed side night stand only. Plugged my phone in nightly. After about 4 months of use, the cable failed at the point where the cable entered the connector.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Didn't last long.;I have had this cable for little more than a month and it has stopped working. It will still charge occasionally,  but I have had to switch back to my old cable for charging now. It's a real bummer since I really like the extra length this cable provided.
5.0 out of 5 stars;This is something you need!;All I can say is this is a great!!!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Durability is terrible.;Very frustrated with this cord. I bought it to replace a cord I had for almost 3 years. I've had this one for less then 2 months (bought December 27th) and it's already failing like my old one. That's just unacceptable.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Stop working after 2 months;I thought since it was threaded it would last longer.  I'm not rough on my charging cords, I don't even move them around but keep them specifically left plugged in where I need them.  This one was nice to use because of its length but unfortunately I can no longer use it after couple months if even that.  Oh well.  I'll try a different brand next time.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Slow to charge;The charger itself is the perfect length, but it takes nearly all night to fully charge my LG Velvet phone with it. Great buy if that works for you, not so much if you need a quick charge.
3.0 out of 5 stars;ot fade me. it's working good so far just got it back in April 2021. I like it.;it charges very fast and it's good for when you are in your bed and want to watch a movie.
1.0 out of 5 stars;questionable quality;after a few months of use the cable is completed dead, used to charged an iPad while sitting at a desk and somehow the cable just stopped working. Still looks new, with no bending and it is completed dead. Do not recommend due to durability issues.
2.0 out of 5 stars;It didn't last a month;I bought this for light use to charge my phone next to my bed. It didn't last a month before the wires inside of it snapped or something because it stopped working without being bent at the right angles and then eventually that didn't even work.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good;Good product
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not New;I purchased the product in what I thought was new condition, but the product arrive opened. I didn't want to risk trying it on my device.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Short lived;Worked great for about two weeks, then stopped charging effectively. My phone estimates charging time to 100% and after two weeks it started saying it would take 5 to 7 HOURS to get to 100%. Durable cord, but charging function is sorely lacking. Would not recommend.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good quality;So far, so good.  Bought one from another seller in August and it just stopped working.  This one is solid and strong and length is great to drag close to you from an outlet.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Fits well and fast charging.;Quality product.  Fits well and charges fast as advertised.  The cord is very pliable, not stiff like most braided cords.  I would definitely purchase again and recommend this product.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Very Poor Connection;The connection end to the phone falls right out. You can't move the phone at all.  Kinda defeats the whole purpose
2.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped fast charging after 6 weeks;Recieved on Jan 6. Worked great for the first 6 weeks. I liked the length of the cable. But it stopped being able to fast charge on Feb 19. It now takes 5-6 hours to charge my phone.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good strong cable but did not work for what I ordered it for my S7 Samsung;It did not fit my S7 Samsung phone like it said it would it's a rather than return it I gave it to my wife
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nothing fancy but a decent Cable.;Seems to do what you think it'd do. Cables work as intended. Nothing fancy but if you want a cheap decent cable it'll suffice well enough.
3.0 out of 5 stars;nice at first but...;broke pretty fast. wouldnt waste too much on this again :')
5.0 out of 5 stars;The best cable I have!!;It's a really nice long cable and the charging power is great as your original type c cables. I really love this!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Broke in 2 weeks;This broke in like 2 weeks. I had to jiggle it every time to try and get it to work. I'll plug it in at night and I'd wake up and my phone was dead.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works;It works great
1.0 out of 5 stars;Broke in less then a month of use.;Cables started to come undone not even a month in. Think its like 2 weeks of use. Not durable and long lasting but the cable is indeed long. Only pro while using it was the long cable. The speed of charging was kinda moderate. It wasnt fast at all but it did the job.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Didn't Last;Cord is very long.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good charging cable;I just received it a few days ago - it's just the cable, no plug. Does the fast charge, good length, good price.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Out of the Box, Did Not Work for iPhone X, iPhone 11 Pro;I could understand if the cord didn't work for one of our family's phones — maybe the phone had a bad port, but it didn't work for any of our phones. We have since replace the cord with one from another manufacturer that works fine.
2.0 out of 5 stars;broken after 1 month;Used it for a bit more than 1 month and its not working anymore. i plug it, and it does not charge the phone everytime.Never moved it, it has been at the same spot on the same plug for the whole time, but there is a cable issue.look for an other brand.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Great fast charger and very long durable cord.;Becomes malfunctioning after few uses. Now it is no longer a fast charger.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Price;Everything is perfect,  I given 3 start because is cheaper somewhere else.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charging;I needed a longer charging cord but didn't realize that the longer the cord, I assume, the slower the charge.  This cord is very slow.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great purchase;The length and durability is perfect especially when me toddler wants to watch her dying tablet everywhere but near an outlet. It also came in handy during a road trip.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great strength fast charger.;Durable well made charger. Fast charging well built much better then most others I have gotten.
3.0 out of 5 stars;This is not a fast charging cord;Good cord. Very long which I needed. But it's advertised as fast charging. It is not. It takes twice as long to charge.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Didn't Last 3 months. Same as the 1st time.;Took a second chance on this cord in case the first one I'd tried was an exception. I like the long cord. This one lasted a little over 90 days.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Can’t expect much for the price;I know it’s a bit cheaper of a charger but mine already seems to be shorting out. Guess that’s what I get for trying to cheaper. I was using it to charge a baby monitor though so not really used alot but only had for a few days. Probably will just spring and spend the money next time
5.0 out of 5 stars;Charges great! Love the length of the cord!;Great product! Loved the length, and it charges fast
1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't charge my phone;The charger fits into my phone and everything but it charges it at 1/10 the speed that it would take regularly. It will say 10 hours until full with the phone being at 40% when with my other cords plugged into the same block will say 2 or 3 hours from 0% and I will be able to go on it which I absolutely cannot do with this cord as it will drain my battery if I go on it at all while charging. 0/10 would not recommend to anyone because it practically does not work.
5.0 out of 5 stars;It works great;It works great
2.0 out of 5 stars;The cord got can't transfer data;So I had to get a different cord to transfer my to my pc.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Great for less than a month;It was great and worked well....never moved it from its place and less than 30 days in, it shorted and never charged correctly again.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped working after about 3 days;I originally bought this charger for my iPad Pro 2020 because the charger that comes with it is so short and I’d like to use my iPad while it is still charging sometimes. The first couple days, if I was on the iPad while charging, it would DRAIN the battery down until it died while on the charger. Also, even when I would get off of it and try to just let it charge without using it, it took longer to charge than using the original charger it came with. Finally after a few days it just gave up completely. It could have not worked because it’s a phone charger and iPads require more power? Either way, Wouldn’t recommend or buy again.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't work With Plug Adaptor;Maybe I didn't read or understand the product description, but it won't work with the standard USB Electric plug adaptor. That's the device that allows a charger with a USB port to plug into an outlet. At first I thought it wasn't working, until I plugged it directly to the USB jack on my laptop. That's where it works.It's not worth me sending it back. I'll use it as needed while I'm on my laptop until I'll go to a actual store and get the long cord charger I need for my LG Stylo6.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Love the lenght;Love the longer length. Have no problems and it charges quickly.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Waste of money - doesn't last!;"I purchased this charging cable thinking it would be nice to have a nice long 10ft. cord so it I would be able to use my phone in my bed while charging because I couldn't do that with the shorter cord that I already had. I also bought this particular product because it looked great and was a great value at under $8.00 on sale. Unfortunately, this charging cable lasted a little over a week before it stopped working altogether and wouldn't charge my phone anymore. At the price I paid, it's not worth the trouble of going through the return process - I'd spend more money on gas driving to a store/return location. The bottom line is ""You get what you pay for"" so I lost a little money and will now spend more on a higher quality item (and I will make sure it is NOT made in China like this one)!"
5.0 out of 5 stars;I love it!!!;This works perfect for my needs especially the length!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Easily Breakable;The Cord was not durable n broke in 2 weeks.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Cable stopped working after 3 weeks;The cable worked for 3 weeks then it stopped charging my Samsung 10se Phone and my Samsung Tablet. Loved the length of the cable. Very disappointed cable stopped working.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Worked for about a week or two;No longer working, and it's only been a month. Horrible quality, do not recommend. Loved the length, but it hardly works.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Good charger breaks quick;Good charger but it stopped working after only a month
3.0 out of 5 stars;Pretty Good. 8/10.;Definelty long enough for what i needed. Charges fast, relatively sturdy, but if you spend more you get better. Simple economics.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Extended Rope Cord;I love the rope cord. It is sometimes hard to find these in the stores near me. The length of the cord is great! Great quality for a great price.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Be warned;The length was good but it stopped working after two months.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect for office, car or home use;I like that it's a long cord and doesn't kink when you wrap it up.
3.0 out of 5 stars;It broke;So I had to reorder it
4.0 out of 5 stars;thanks;Thanks
3.0 out of 5 stars;Great, but only worked for a few months for me;I ordered this is May, it has been working GREAT and I'm careful with how I use it. Last night it was not charging my phone, and of course I am out of the return time frame.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good;Good
3.0 out of 5 stars;Mmm;It makes my wall part of the charge hot
2.0 out of 5 stars;Poor quality. Broken after 1 month of use.;The tip that goes into the phone has already broken. This product is low quality and built poorly.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great charger, great price;It's great and sturdy.Chargers pretty quickly. Great charger. Great price
3.0 out of 5 stars;Charging;Stopped fast charging after a month
1.0 out of 5 stars;slow charging;slowest charging ever possible. buy only for the length not for charging.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Did not last long;Stopped connecting on the USB C side after a few months of limited use.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Samsung charger;This charger charges really fast. Which I love. It is long and colors are pretty cool. I have no complaints.
2.0 out of 5 stars;unreliable quality;have 4 of these and one just wont charge.  Switched out the wall plug and phones various times and its definitely the cable that is bad
4.0 out of 5 stars;It works;Great product,  lengthy cord allows me to use my phone easily while it charges
5.0 out of 5 stars;Sturdy and Stylish;Cord is heavier, stiffer than most.  Doesn’t bend at connection points so seems likely to break.  Industrial look.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't stay charging;This does not stay in the phone it keeps falling out
1.0 out of 5 stars;Slowest charger in history;This is the slowest charging cable ever … do not buy!!!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Worked for 3 weeks then stopped charging;When I first got them, they were working fine, but after about 20 plus charges, it stop fast charging. Sometimes the device doesn't even recognize the charger. Clearly this was not durable or it was a manufacturing defect.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Loved it so much, I bought a second one.;Super fast charging cord and great durability and awesome flexibility!  Loved it so much, I bought a second one.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Both Cords Stopped Working Within the First Month;One of the cords never worked, the second one stopped working around the 1 month mark. Perhaps I just happened to get a pair of lemons based upon the many five-star reviews, but I won't be purchasing products from this brand in the future.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Didnt work.;edit: added back some stars for excellent customer service!Didnt charge out of the package for the Samsung galaxy s8 I purchased it for. Will be returning.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Charger;The insert part was too loose
3.0 out of 5 stars;Too long;Cord length is too long....
3.0 out of 5 stars;Connection Issues - Not a fan;Quite a few issues with connection and staying connected. Continuous Syncing and desynching. Not a fan.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Wanted to love;I was so excited to receive this item in the mail. The charger is so thick, I thought no way I can get a shortage in this. It wasn’t until just 3 days later it didn’t work for me any longer.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Won't Work Long;After just 2 weeks it doesn't work anymore.  It worked the way its supposed to at first, then went to in and out charging and now nothing.  I've owned it exactly 17 days.
5.0 out of 5 stars;type C Charger 10 ft, USB C;nice long charging cord.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good cable so far;So far it is working good it is a little bigger then I thought when I ordered but that might be a good thing
2.0 out of 5 stars;Initially worked great, 5 months later, not so much;I originally was very happy with this purchase. But about 4 to 5 months after I purchased it, it will not fast charge my phone any more. I thought it might be an issue with my phone, but other chargers work just fine. So now it takes 6 hours to charge my phone which is not ideal.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Dont keep it's charged;Yes hi I used my 10 foot cord too charge my cell phone for 2 weeks and then it stopped charging my phone so I threw it away and I'm buying one from Walmart
1.0 out of 5 stars;Faulty;Bought this cord in the beginning of August and less than a month later it has stopped not only fast charging but charging general.. the cord length is as desired but as far as everything else goes I would not recommend this cord
2.0 out of 5 stars;Lasted 3 months;Super long. Worked as it should but only for 3 months. Adult used for occasional charging.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not a great buy;It's easy to get little breaka in cord and it's didn't last very long
1.0 out of 5 stars;Garbage!;It waited until I was literally 4 days out of my return window and it stopped working smh It started shorting about 2 weeks ago but I thought it was user error. Now it completely doesn't work on anything so it's definitely the cord. That's ridiculous smh
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not a speedy recharge cord;the cords are study and durable, but it takes 4x as long to recharge with these cords as it does with the other cored that I bought.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great replacement or addition for travel;Cable is really long, so easy to tuck out of the way. Charges my Pixel 4XL quickly. Super value. Verizon similar cable was a lot more $$.
2.0 out of 5 stars;My cable just start heating up extraordinarily.;My cable just start heating up extraordinarily. It's wire has low durability. Now, right in month, return window is just closed. I lost my 12 bucks.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't stay in;It won't stay in. Tried with and without phone case. Just keeps falling out of place
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works perfectly;I was for a longer charge cable for my Samsung Galaxy S9 because the one that comes with the phone was too short and the Samsung Fast Charger Wall Plug won't work with any USB cable. This cable is not only long enough but works with the Wall Plug. Looking forward to buying another one soon.
1.0 out of 5 stars;It worked right up to when return window closed.;it worked good for about 3 weeks. It just stopped working won’t charge any Device. On the tablet it says moisture is being detected but it’s never been wet. I wouldn’t buy it again. The length was great but if it won’t charge anything then the length doesn’t matter.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not very reliable;I bought 2. One works fine still. The other seems to not be working anymore. Only had them maybe a month. Very disappointing.
4.0 out of 5 stars;It works;Well this is the only cable I purchased that makes this kind of bell sound while plugged in. Any ideas?
3.0 out of 5 stars;Dont buy it;It just work for 1 week so dont buy it
2.0 out of 5 stars;charges slowly;Doesn't charge either phones very well. Takes forever and often disconnects.
1.0 out of 5 stars;SAVE YOUR MONEY;So I bought this about a week ago and was working perfectly than justa. Week later I can't even really charge  when my cable is straight I have to twist my cable to even get it to charge and even with that it still doesn't charge fast. After a couple more weeks of use it wont charge at all. I want a FULL REFUND this was the worst purchase ever and it suscks. i loved the length but the charger wont upoerate unless with a extreme force to pull iy away from me or push it towards me.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect;Just what I was looking for
2.0 out of 5 stars;Broke quickly unreliable charging;Poor quality broke unreliable charging
3.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charge;Like the length but barely charges over night
2.0 out of 5 stars;Disappointed;Only have the cord for couple days and it's hardly charging now and slow
2.0 out of 5 stars;Don’t cheap out;The charger worked fine for the first few days but it stopped working completely on my laptop and iPad after such a short period of time.
1.0 out of 5 stars;It has to keep being unplugged for real charge time.;Have to keep unplugging and unplugging because the charger says 22 hrs. And I have to keep unplugging it until it gives me the sound. But love the length.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works as described;This is exactly what I was looking for.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good;It’s a really nice cable for the price I would recommend
3.0 out of 5 stars;However it does the job.;It doesn't alliw for a super charge. It's more of a trickle charge.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great tough little guy;Useful
2.0 out of 5 stars;Falling apart after a month;Doesn't fast charge even when using a fast charge block. Both ends are coming off, I have to carefully and gently plug it into my phone and not use my phone while it's charging or it stops working. Get what you pay for I guess.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Nice Long  and Sturdy Charging Cable;I've only used it for 10 mins, but it works great on my iPad.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Its okay just got a bad one;Stopped working
2.0 out of 5 stars;Cheap product does not work well;Don't work well
1.0 out of 5 stars;Can't use.;The USB C end connector is too short and won't stay plugged in to my tablet.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Lasted 2 weeks;Chord actually too long
5.0 out of 5 stars;Awesome;Love it
2.0 out of 5 stars;Quit charging after 4 months of use!;Paid extra for durability, what a waste.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great cable, sturdy;20180810: I bought this for my son to use in the car to charge his Nintendo Switch. It has done great, and holds up well. The cord is long, and well built. It is a little stiffer than other cords, but it performs well and the Switch stays charged.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good but becareful;This charger chord did it's job until it started smoking this morning on Thanksgiving leaving me with no phone charger.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Save your money;While the extent of the cord is really good, it doesn't take much before it's broken and you have to spend another sum for replacement chargers. I would not recommend buying this unless you're wanting the charger for a brief period.
5.0 out of 5 stars;What charger end goes to your phone;Love the 10 ft. Cable. The cord that come with the phone isn't long enough to charge and use your phone at the same time. This gives me plenty of cord to use my phone while charging.  Very sturdy.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not so great;So far so good. Had it forabout 3 weeks.Update: didn't last very long.  Stopped charging
1.0 out of 5 stars;Top broke off after two months;It worked fine but one day it just stopped charging.
2.0 out of 5 stars;It didn't last very long;After 1 week, it stopped working for me!
3.0 out of 5 stars;definitely worth the price;"it worked well for a couple weeks. Then started getting ""loose"" when it was inside of the charging port."
1.0 out of 5 stars;Lasted less than 1 year;Unfortunately this cord is not durable despite the appearance. Lasted less than one year. Piece next to the phone plug came loose and slips. Have to place the cord in the phone exactly right to charge. Cuts in and out, which is extremely annoying when trying to plug in while driving to use navigation. Going in the garbage.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Exactly what I needed;Exactly what we needed
5.0 out of 5 stars;charging cord;Sturdy cord
5.0 out of 5 stars;Excellent;My phone
3.0 out of 5 stars;works for the most part;It is a nice charger but doesn't always work right away
1.0 out of 5 stars;Will not work after 3 months;Originally was perfect good length good charge.  End of December kept getting alerts when xharging to check charging connection.  Got a new box still same message, changed outlets same message.  Finally I changed to my original chord from 4 years ago and everything is fine.  Soon as I change back to the new chord same message.  Cannot believe it only lasted 3 months but I suppose I didn't pay much for it.  Also this is only used at the most 3 times a week since it is at my office.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Quality;Very nice
5.0 out of 5 stars;Durable cord;The cord works great. It's very sturdy, I use it in my truck.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Phone cord;Did not work with my equipment.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good;Good
2.0 out of 5 stars;Can't keep a charge;Worked great for 2 or 3 weeks but now it struggles to keep a charge if I move my phone a certain way. I'm constantly on my phone while it's charging and now I cannot use it in order to keep a charge, extremely frustrating.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Strong cord;Very nice !! Love how I can play games and hold phone where it hurts 🤣
3.0 out of 5 stars;Maybe it's just my phone but...;This is not a fast-charging cord. The length is great for added versatility but my LG V40 doesn't benefit at all from a faster charge.
5.0 out of 5 stars;JUST WHAT I WANTED. ARRIVED FAST>;THANK YOU I LOVE THIS ITEM.
5.0 out of 5 stars;good;works as expected
2.0 out of 5 stars;lasted about 2 months;I was using this for my Samsung tablet. The end became frayed and loose after 2 months and stopped charging my tabley. Would not but again

5.0 out of 5 stars;Sturdy cord....nice long length;Nice and long....I can charge my phone from across the room

5.0 out of 5 stars;Excelente;Súper largo, calidad muy buena
5.0 out of 5 stars;Bargain find, price, quality,  and length;awsome long cable.  Fast charging, solid connection to ports, strong well made cord, great price
3.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charger;It is a slow charger..not recommended
2.0 out of 5 stars;Lasted 4 weeks;Loved the length of the cord but unfortunately lasted only little over 1 month with daily charging of my galaxy phone. Now when I try to use it says to check connection and it will not charge. Will try different brand
1.0 out of 5 stars;I got two and both stoped working after a few months;I thought my phone was the problem but I got also the same charger for my wife and hers also stopped working after a few months. Not worth it.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Doesnt charge super fast;It charges normally not really fast.
5.0 out of 5 stars;works great, plenty of length when you need it;4' cables don't do it for me. I need something I can move around with. The Deegotech cable does it for me! Strong, sturdy, and plenty flexible. You should get it.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Good charger if you have all day to wait because it's not a fast charger like advertised;I purchased this charged because it's advertised as a fast charge cord but it's not...right now my phone is at 73% and it's going to take 42mins to charge it to 100... that's NOT fast but it is sturdy and super long. I gave it 2 stars because it is very sturdy but it doesn't charge fast like it's advertised to do.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Defective cord!!!;All the review that stated this cord only works for a month or two is absolutely correct! You only will get 10 weeks max out of usage. I ordered a replacement and it worked the same amount of time. They are all defective.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Don't expect it to last long;Bought 3 of these, all 3 no longer charge unless held at certain angles. Lasted 2 months.
4.0 out of 5 stars;It's still new just got the a week ago but it has wroth the price.;Quilty cord I might have chosen a cord a little longer than I need but happy with it.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Poor quality. You get what you pay for.;This charging power cord didn't work well. We used it a total of 8 times, and neither cords works anymore. Poor quality.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Junk;Wouldn't work brand new - one so had to return both
5.0 out of 5 stars;The charger cord worked out perfectly;I liked i could use with my tablet and phone.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Sadly disappointed;Got this cord as a replacement for a thinner one that was used in the bedroom and starting to kink in several places.  Because it is kept in the bedroom, it isn't used that frequently, once a week maybe twice.  For good measure, we'll call it twice a week.  Anyway, went to use it last night and it will no longer connect with my phone.  The wiring in the housing that connects to the phone is loose and unless held in a specific position, won't work.  Checked to see if it might be the phone and it's not. Every other cord I've tried works just fine, including the janky one that is all kinked (yes, the one this one was supposed to replace).  I highly suggest looking for a better cord.
1.0 out of 5 stars;THIS CORD LOOKS FANTASTIC..CHARGES HORRIBLY!;Upon looks...this is a top notch product...HOWEVER...I cannot handle charge time changing from fast charge to 38 hours! (Yes..thats the record) I goto bed 10 p.m ..wake up 530 a.m. with half charged. There is nothing wrong with my port..phone or outlet. When I first plug this in..charge time perfect but it changes..causes alerts on my phone... If this cord would charge in 5 hours..I could handle slow charge while sleeping ..I literally cannot depend  on this so I threw it away!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Fast charge to slow charge;I wanted to love this, but the fast charge didn't even last long. I can't be waiting 6+ hours for my phone to charge. The length is great and if you constantly have your phone charging, this will work.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Worked great for 2 weeks and then stopped transmitting data.;Worked great for 2 weeks and then stopped transmitting data.It suddenly stopped working, I set it up from my computer didn't move it much, it works for charging but it's useless for data transfer after 2 weeks.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Durable and worth the price.;It's a great product. Very durable and the 10 foot reach is awesome.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped working within two months;This cable stopped working within 2 months of getting it.
5.0 out of 5 stars;works as advertised;very nice cable  that seems like it will last a long time
2.0 out of 5 stars;6 months.;I purchased this charger in Oct 2020. It's now April 2021 and it is not longer working. It won't stay in the port. I have other chargers that are still staying in the port so I know the port is not the problem. 6 months. Not great. It did charge fast in those 6 months.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Poor fit;The cord does not fit tightly in my phone and therefore does not charge properly!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Beware. Not Durable;This product only lasted six weeks. There appears to be a break in the line because it completely stopped charging. I contacted the seller. it was outside of Amazon's 30 day return policy and never heard anything back.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Didn't last;Plastic piece on charging end is loose and slides around. Have to wiggle cord to get it to work
1.0 out of 5 stars;Beware, loose connections or broken wires.;I have only used this cord 4-6 times in a couple months of buying it.  I bought it for a backup or to use when I needed the extra length.  Anyway, after just a few uses it is now intermittent.  I can see from some other reviews about a fire hazard, I believe that is probably the next step in this one if I continue trying to use it.
1.0 out of 5 stars;It's only been a short while and already it's not wanting to charge my phone.;I only got this cord a couple months ago, at the most, and already it is not wanting to charge my phone. I do not get on my phone while it is charging, it sits on my night stand and the cord is not getting bent in all kinds of ways. It was a good price and the cord is really long. The durability is not good at all
3.0 out of 5 stars;This chord is long and thick :);The length is great and is made well.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Find products but advertised wrong and didn't fit my phone;Nothing is wrong with this item except for the fact that it's advertised as USB - C and it's not  So it does not fit my Samsung Galaxy note 10 plus come if it was a USB- C it would fit.
5.0 out of 5 stars;I got what I paid for.;It works. It does what its supposed to do. I am happy with it
3.0 out of 5 stars;Ok;Daily usage, it's ok
2.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't fast charge at all;I like that the cable is long enough but my galaxy a50 takes longer than 3 hours to fully charge with this cable. Even with multiple wall plug-ins and outlets, it never charges fast.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Cable wire;Like always it quit working where
5.0 out of 5 stars;The length is great.;Work perfectly for my phone and ps5 controllers.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Excellent choice;Cord length
2.0 out of 5 stars;Waste of Money;This is the second time I have bought this charger and both times they stopped working, but this time I bought this charger about 2 weeks ago and it's already not working anymore. I will return them.
4.0 out of 5 stars;It charges;It charges
1.0 out of 5 stars;No Go;I so wanted to love this charger!  I am in the hospital, waiting for a liver, and my phone is my lifeline. It charged my Galaxy S9 twice. Now it is randomly off and on, never charging the phone fully. The cord is fantastic and it feels well-made. My husband has the identical phone and this charger will not charge that phone either.  :(
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not recommended to purchase a long cord, as they do not last to charge phones.;Does not last of usage. Wouldn't recommend to purchase this charger. Short cords are a better use and last longer.
2.0 out of 5 stars;"Not ""Fast"" charging";Its not a fast charging cord. I usually let my device get down to about 18-19% before I charge it and this cord says it will have my device at 100% in over 2 hours. My other fast charger charges in no more than 90 minutes.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Disconnected too easily;It charged, which is great of course. But it slipped out so easily. Even the slightest movement would disconnect it which was frustrating.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Didn't last long;Liked the length was not as durable as I thought it should be didn't last long. Stopped charging after a month
2.0 out of 5 stars;Charger plug became loose after 1 month,  doesn't stay connected to phone and charge;Usb c became loose on cord and doesn't charge phone well after 1 month of use
5.0 out of 5 stars;Nurse Joy 205 ☺;Great product ❤👌
1.0 out of 5 stars;Charging cable;The cables don't even charge my phone it kills my battery and if I do change it I have to leave it on charging for all day
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great product and great length of the cord;Love it and love how long it is .
2.0 out of 5 stars;Received a returned item?;The cable feels sturdy and seems to be working fine (for now) BUT the item I received came in an unsealed bag. The top seal was already torn open which I assume this was a returned item. This worries me if there is something wrong with how the cable functions especially I’m using this as cable for data storage.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Worth it;Durable and good length
5.0 out of 5 stars;Looks good;Can't speak for long term durability
4.0 out of 5 stars;weiner;I like them. They seem to be pretty good.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good product;I just got this cable.But so far so good
2.0 out of 5 stars;Only received one.;Did not receive the two pack. Only received one.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Short Lifespan;Only used for short period of time and it doesnt work anymore. The length was great and the chord still looks brand new (I guess b/c it is). There is no visible reason why it should not work, but it does not charge my phone. Complete rip off, unless you like to buy brand new chord every other month or so.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Love it;Perfect.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charging;With this specific charger my phone almost takes forever for full charge. Dont know if that happens because I got a bad one or the cable is too long for fast charging.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped Working;Worked great for about a month, however it wouldn't connect to my phone anymore. Tried my husband's phone and it did the same thing. Used another charger and that worked, so it's the charger that's not working. Kinda disappointed.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Its fine;It works as a backup charger but it is not fast charging. I have a s9 plus and use the stock charger with this cable. Does not fast charge.
3.0 out of 5 stars;It’s not the best;Not the fastest but gets the job done
5.0 out of 5 stars;Fast shipping;Used for my kids tablet
1.0 out of 5 stars;Falls right out;Falls right out.....too loose. Waste of money
2.0 out of 5 stars;It barely works.;"Almost always get a ""check your charger connection"" notification and then the phone won't charge"
3.0 out of 5 stars;Well made but does NOT fast charge LG thinQ;This product arrived on time, seems sturdy enough, decent materials but does not do what it's supposed to do.  It's supposed to be a fast charger being a type C charger.  It does not work as a quick charger on my phone LG thinQ.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Average charging cable;Works fine but is a standard product nothing special.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Super fast charging;I love the product it is super fast charging and I like the length of it
2.0 out of 5 stars;Disappointed;I bought this for my Oculus and it is next to useless for it.
5.0 out of 5 stars;great cable;Very well made. Really fast charging. 2nd one I purchased. Great product
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great buy;Love it
1.0 out of 5 stars;doesn't last long;I've had this for a less then a month and rarely use it but it already disconnects frequently.hence low stars.honestly disappointed
5.0 out of 5 stars;No kinking!;The cord has not kinked where the cord meets the hardware (as usually happens with cables). I am very happy with this purchase!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Work well;Love the length
5.0 out of 5 stars;That it's fast and very good;Charging my phone
2.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charging after 4 months;I've only had it for 4 months and it gets used about 4 days a week. Slow charging, takes forever. If I'm on my phone while it's charging it loses battery.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Strength?;Didn’t really charge the iPad.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Nice;Was everything I was expecting
5.0 out of 5 stars;great cord;Does exactly what I needed it to do. Works good.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Trash;I didn't even have it for a week and it broke
1.0 out of 5 stars;What I order works!;Only used this two times and the end that fits in tablet fell off inside the computer. It was on my grandsons tablet and he is a little upset.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Short circuit?;I bought this charger on the 27th of October 2021. It's the 2nd now and I'm experiencing short circuit. There's no frays or anything but it won't charge at certain times.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Better ones out there;The cord does not stay in the phone itself.  Even if I leave the phone alone it finds it’s way out.  These were my back up and I realized after return policy or I would have returned.
5.0 out of 5 stars;zN/A;
3.0 out of 5 stars;Iffy;Works with my phone but not my girlfriend's. Not sure why. We have the same phone.
5.0 out of 5 stars;good;ordered one from ebay and it didn't work this one does
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great purchase;Perfect for me.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Don't waste your money;I bought this cord and it stopped charging after only 2 days. They offered a replacement with the return of the first cord. I wasn't able to return the first one due to my work hours and location. Our post office isn't manned on weekends which is my days off... the second cord stopped working after 2 weeks... now I've paid for 2 cords and neither of them work... total waste of time and money!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Worth every penny;Very good product
3.0 out of 5 stars;Cheap for a reason;You get what you pay for. Chord doesn't always fast charge. Length is good.
4.0 out of 5 stars;good timing;good product
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not very well built.;"Cable stop working within a day or two from when I received it and it's really not worth the time and effort to send it back. I'm not too bothered by this because you can only expect so much from a six-dollar cable.  What does bother me though is, the hype in the description of this product. If what I got is a typical representation of what is being shipped out to customers then words like ""durability"" and ""sturdiness"" are a bit misleading to say the least.  My advice is if you're looking for an ""OK""cable at a rock bottom price then this may be what you're looking for."
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good Bang for the buck;It  Allow me to fast charge My phone Moving data Is pretty fast
1.0 out of 5 stars;Only in a pinch;This is not a fast charger. In fact it doesn't keep up with demand of you use the phone while charging.  Takes several hours to fully charge.  I've been using this for only a couple of weeks and it's already fraying at the phone connection end
2.0 out of 5 stars;Slow Charging;I dislike this item that I needed to charge my phone it took forever to charge my phone now I will need to make a new purchase.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Excellent;Nice charging cable, works great.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Chargers;2 of the chargers didn’t work.  It wouldn’t charge my I pad or my daughters Mac.  Rest worked fine as far as I know of right now
2.0 out of 5 stars;Do not work with Pixel 6 Pro;My old Aukey cable does but the 4 of these that I bought do not work, even on first use so it's not that they are damaged.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Ok;After some time of use the cable has to be shifted in the right place for it to charge.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great cord;Great quality charging cord!
5.0 out of 5 stars;It's a cable that operates exactly as a cable should.;It works
2.0 out of 5 stars;Unfortunately, it didn't last;It stopped working within a week if getting it. I have two other cables that I paid half the price for and they're still working.
5.0 out of 5 stars;strong, sturdy cord;Not sure why Samsung thought they had to change the USB for the G9's but this is a very sturdy cord. I'm satisfied with using it for the majority of my charging.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Cable broke in less than four months;I bought two of these cables, used them occasionally in fixed positions. One of the two has failed in less than four months.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped working after 2 weeks;Love the length, but the wire stopped working after two weeks. The wire also isn't recognized by your phone as a fast charging one as advertised.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not that good!;I think the length of the cord causes it not charge like it should. You have to keep making sure that it's plugged in (even though it is)... that little message keeps showing up to remind you to plug it in & most important, it takes ages to charge your phone
1.0 out of 5 stars;Did not charge my phone.;It charges very slowly.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Fast;Charges fast
5.0 out of 5 stars;Extra long phone charging cord;Great length and great quality. Love the color
2.0 out of 5 stars;Very limited usefulness to this charger cable;I have found that after only a few months of using this charging cable - and without subjecting it to any kind of stress or abuse whatsoever - that the cable is becoming more and more unreliable almost by the day.  It is now regularly failing to deliver a charge.  Either it never begins charging the phone at all when connected (which normally causes the phone to beep and to display a charging icon - or it simply stops charging while connected.  This unreliability is not only frustrating, it's costly.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped fast charging;After a few weeks, the cord stopped fast charging my phone.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Stop working suddenly;Bought this not too long ago and now it doesn't work
5.0 out of 5 stars;Did l receive and like me products;like it, my samsung galaxy plus 9 cell phone
4.0 out of 5 stars;👍👍👍;It's ok depends on charger box
1.0 out of 5 stars;Stops working after a few weeks;"Made the mistake of buying this charger cord two times. The first one lasted a couple of months before it stopped working. The 2nd one only lasted like 3 weeks before it became useless. The phone will recognize the charger but will display ""check your charger connection"" and will take like 8 hours to charge, if it even works at all. I won't make the mistake of buying this brand again."
1.0 out of 5 stars;Didn't even hold up a month;What I really didn't like is having to leave all day with my phone almost dead that was left on the cord all night. The connector wore down in less than a month. My other 10ft (different brand) has been going strong for 2 years!
3.0 out of 5 stars;I can only use it for note 9 not for S8;it says it can be used for galaxy S8 but it doesn't work ... just for note 9
1.0 out of 5 stars;Works... Not for long;Thus charger works only for a couple months then slowly quits on you. Takes absolutely forever to charge the phone ang glitches and thinks I'm pulling it out and putting it back in repeatedly.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Will buy one for myself.;Bought this for a friend. She loves it.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Poor quality;I've had this charger less than 1 mo. & It has just stopped charging.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not satisfied;HFirst got and it would connect to my phone each time. Now it takes seversy attempts to get it connected properly
1.0 out of 5 stars;Garbage charger;"This charger is awful, I've never seen a ""slow charging"" mode before this product, my old and broken charger works better."
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great cable.;Long sturdy and great quality.
2.0 out of 5 stars;This cord doesn't charge fast at all..;Doesn't charge fast takes 5 hours to charge
1.0 out of 5 stars;Kept saying to check charger connection 😑;This is my second time buying it this year and the first one lasted longer. I have bought that one September 19th 2021 and today we are the 26th. I thought it was my phone but this is supposed to be a fast charging cord and It would literally take 3 hours for my phone to be full. One time I left my phone in charge all night and still woke up to find my phone at 70%. This is the worst. Very bad
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works great!;My charging chords always seemed to break, but this one is so durable!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Okay;I really like this charger, it's really long and durable but it randomly stop working. I was very disappointed because I love the length and durability on this
1.0 out of 5 stars;Worked for about a week 😔;Doesn't last long .it's cheap and I wouldn't recommend it .better off buying a different one
1.0 out of 5 stars;NOT GOOD;Broke after a week...
2.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't work long;It no longer works.  Won't charge my phone anymore
1.0 out of 5 stars;Do NOT purchase from this brand;It worked great, while it worked. This chord has no durability. I used it just to plug my phone in at night. Not harsh on it, no tugging, no weird angles, NOTHING, and it stopped working immediately after the return window closed. (Literally, the next day.) This brand is a scam and I strongly suggest you look anywhere else for a charging cable.
1.0 out of 5 stars;First time having a charging cable spark;At about the 9 month mark, my device had trouble charging and I kept having to reposition the cable to get it to work. And then it sparked and smoked while I was charging and using the device. Got lucky and only the cable was damaged. I've had other cables that stopped working, but never like this.If it starts to show issues, throw it away or return it. This cable can become a fire hazard.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not happy with charger;Not charging after two months. Goes in and out with charge.
2.0 out of 5 stars;2 day use :/;Pretty disappointed with my purchase unfortunately the cable didn't charge my phone or anything else I'd connect to it
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great product.;Working great with my new Samsung S9. Fast charge.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Poor design and or manufacturing;The device connection end is fragile and has too much slop, or, in other words, it is poorly designed and poorly made. It has fully failed to be able to connect to any of my 3 devices after part time use in less than 60 days.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Just what I needed.;Item received as expected
3.0 out of 5 stars;Disappointed;They stopped working right within 2 week dont waste your money on it
5.0 out of 5 stars;works!;fits all my android phones
3.0 out of 5 stars;Does not last long;I have gone through two of these.  The phone stops charging because the plug either does not stay connected or is no good
5.0 out of 5 stars;convenient;Using for a hospital admission, length is great!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Bad connection port;This cord is super durable and ling- but it doesn't hold the connection to charge tge phone. Spend the extra few dollars for something better- this won't work.Worse is its more trouble to the consumer to return the item for a replacement than to just buy a better one.Flop.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not to bad;It's ok
1.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped Working After 5 Months;I've only had this 5 months and it doesn't work anymore.  The piece that it plugs into, which plugs into the wall, still works with other cords, so it's definitely the cord.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Very satisfied!;So far so good. It's very good quality and stays plugged in. It's very sturdy. I'm very satisfied!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Charging concern.;Love the length, but hate that it stopped fast charging after a few days.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Works great until it doesn’t;This charger worked great for about a month. Then it suddenly only worked on some of my devices (Headphones instead of tablet)  After about two weeks of that, it decided to stop working altogether. A month later, my husband was looking for a charger to charge his portable battery and grabbed this one, it was working again, for four or five days that is.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Already broken..;I bought this July 10th. I loved the reinforced cable and the length,  but unfortunately it won't charge my phone as of yesterday.  Terribly disappointed.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Fast Shipping;Great item that works great with my phone.  Very fast shipping.  Will be sure to check this seller out again if I ever need another!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not so durable;Frayed really quickly at the end where the phone e plugs in.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works well!;I like the cord.  It's long and works well.  No issues!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Like;I like the length of the cable
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good quality;Its strong
4.0 out of 5 stars;No problems yet.;Good product.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Does not charge fast or even moderate;Very Very slow to charge. If you have 8 hours to charge than it will work or if you just need to keep a charge.
2.0 out of 5 stars;stopped working after two months;The cord was great while it lasted. It stopped working after two months.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Lasted 6 weeks;Tip fell off in 6 weeks
1.0 out of 5 stars;This cord is no good.;The only thing good about this cord is the length. It is incapable of fast charging. It slow charges my phone. Every time my phone moves it stops charging. I have to move the cord around to get it to start back slow charging. The quality of charge from this cord is terrible
1.0 out of 5 stars;Breaks within 2 months;I've had this charger for approximately 2 months now and it is very inconsistent with the charging. I have to maneuver the cord in a very particular way for it to actually charge. Then I can't move my phone because then it will stop.The speed of the charging is fine, when it works. But you can't really say a charger is useful when the durability is low.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Didn't Last Long;it worked fine at first but I only had this cable 4 months before it started slow charging my devices.  REALLY slow charging.  Now I have to buy a new cable because after plugging in my phone over night I still don't have a full battery.  Other cables seem to work fine on the same devices.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Two uses;It broke the second time it was used. We stored it in a carrying case so I'm pretty bummed that we had to replace it already.
5.0 out of 5 stars;exelente;muy bueno fuerte y resistente con buen largo de cable
5.0 out of 5 stars;Worth the money spent.;Really nice. So far so good.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Lasted 3 months;Worked perfect until today.  Won't charge any devices, no connection at all.  No visible signs of damage just caput, now its junk.  It is really long and braided so I may use it as a jump rope.  If that doesn't work I can maybe put a hook on it and fish with it.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Waste of money;The charger doesn’t work, it never charged my phone!!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Disappointed;Just bought this about 3 days ago and it has a shortage ... I have to play with cord to charge very disappointing
1.0 out of 5 stars;They stop working after 2 1/2 months;Cord length is good, but the cord stop charging after 2 1/2 months
5.0 out of 5 stars;Length and flexibilty;The length is great!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Worth;Useful so far. Worth to have it for frequent recharge.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Charging great;I love it
1.0 out of 5 stars;Did not last 3 months;Bought this cable March 21st, 2021. Very fast charging, sturdy. Initially very happy with it. But earlier this week, June 15, 2021 the charge connection won't stay connected. I wake up to find my phone with little or no charge. If I jiggle the connection at the base of the phone, I can sometimes get it to connect and charge. But I have to be extremely careful moving it, because just the smallest movement breaks the charge connection.... So disappointed. Don't know what to try next... 😞
2.0 out of 5 stars;Great looking but…;The length and the durability are perfect but charging power NOT take too long to change my father LG or my my iPad. My iPad recognize as usb
5.0 out of 5 stars;Value and durability;I like how durable this charger cord is

5.0 out of 5 stars;Can't go wrong with this cable;Great length, great price and feels durable. Very satisfied customer.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Lol absolutely worthless!!!! Do not buy!!!;This cord worked great for the first month or so. Now I can hardly charge my phone with it. I am constantly plugging and fiddling with it in the hopes that it will connect and charge my phone. At this point I have to call it what it is. Garbage. What a waste of money, time and resources.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Exactly as advertised. Excellent product!;Sturdy construction, length is a plus. Thank you!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Product as advertised;Good quality product, will buy again.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Looks good though;For some reason it only charges on slow mode I've used thinner cheaper cords in same plug and they charge rapidly. And I've had like a week and it's already tearing at ends I haven't even used it that much.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Does not charge well. Takes 10 hours to get a full charge.;Cord was long. This was the only positive thing about  the cord. Wished it would have charged phone faster.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Great length but issues already;I’m noticing the connectors when charging are getting hotter to the touch.  I’m throwing in the trash cause I’m not risking a fire.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Well made product;Great product. Would buy again.
2.0 out of 5 stars;It failed at two months;2 months great, then started getting messages that the connection wasn't great when plugging in. All connections were solid, tried it in several different plugs. Charging THEN BEGAN TO TAKE EVEN LONGER- and eventually took FOREVER!  Discontinuing use because it doesn't charge now.  Buying a new charger.
2.0 out of 5 stars;It's not a rapid charger;Not rapid charger
2.0 out of 5 stars;SLOOOOOOOW;DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS CHARGER. Other than being durable (I've stepped on it several times and run it over with my printer cart wheel), it's GARBAGE. One of the slowest chargers I've ever owned.
1.0 out of 5 stars;I wish I listened to reviews;It fast charged once. And now won't fast charge. While my old charger, plugged into the same outlet will fast charge. Crap product.  I wish I listened to the bad reviews. I bet the good reviews are fake. 😡
5.0 out of 5 stars;Pretty awesome;Really great material.
2.0 out of 5 stars;POS;pos. flickers on and off. when it is on, super slow charging. the only good thing about it is that it is long. but if it doesn't charge...who cares how long it is. I hate this thing.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped working after a few days of use;Bought end of May, stayed in hospital bag until June 16th. Used June 16th through July 4th until metal piece fell off making the charger useless.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Excellent cable for home;Needed the extra length and strength.
5.0 out of 5 stars;The best;Perfect
5.0 out of 5 stars;wow fast shipping;Fast shipping! Great product
5.0 out of 5 stars;It works;Great cord....it do what it suppose to do......CHARGE
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good so far!;Just started using it this week. So far working great!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Top rated product;Cable is very useful the way I wanted, length of cable gives me access across the room and best product I've always wanted.
1.0 out of 5 stars;It lasted under 2 weeks.I;I loved the speed and the length. It was great. For about 2 weeks. Then it just stopped working. Well sometimes it worked and other times it wouldn't. I need a cord that works when I need it
1.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped working in less than a month;I normally don't write reviews but this charger just quit on me today. There's no fraying, no excessive bending it was working 20 minutes prior and then it just stopped. I tried other bases and outlets and it still didn't work. I'm honestly super disappointed. It was my only charger so I have to go buy another one tomorrow, I'm using a friend's tonight.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Do not purchase;Havnt had these chargers long and BOTH have stopped working. Worked good only few months. Hve tried it on several different things and they dont charge anything at this point. #refundplease
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not worth it;Started fraying at the end that connected to the phone and now has a limited connection. My phone says it's going to take 36 hours to charge plugged in as it currently is. The only good thing is the length. Love having 10 feet of cord. Go find another one that is more durable.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not In It For The Long Haul;It's been a month and a half since I ordered the cord and not only does it no longer fast charge, but now it will only charge if the cord is hanging a certain way. Very frustrating, but I guess you get what you pay for. I would stay away from this item.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Fast charging does not work with my OnePlus 7T;Fast charging does not work, contrary to some reviews I read. Returning immediately

2.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't work after 4 months;This is not a quality charger, I received it September 30th and I threw it out earlier this week because it stopped charging my phone. Spend a few extra dollars and get something more worthwhile.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Fast Charging;fast shipping and the product is excellent.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Fast charging  & durable  cable;Fast charging.  Long strong cable.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect;Just what I was looking for.
1.0 out of 5 stars;My charger won’t work in any plug. Lost out on money 🙄;Cord hasn’t worked since I got it. I keep trying other charging butts and nothing. Don’t waste your money.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Charges fast;Love the cord so far, works amazingly.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped working in two weeks;At about one week into owning this cable my phone kept telling me to check the charger connection and it would go back to fast charging when I wiggled it a bit. Now it's just not working at all. The cable also gets really hot at the phone end of the charger.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Low power;Low power unfortunately
5.0 out of 5 stars;How long the USB-C connector will last when being used with a fast charger;Cable is as pictured very heavy duty. Only time and use will tell how the USB-C connector terminals hold up to fast charging.
3.0 out of 5 stars;10' c cable. Good for the money;Good 10' c cable.His products are fine however they badger you continuously for reviews, even after reviewing his site.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Horrible quality;These were delivered to me on July 24th and already dead
2.0 out of 5 stars;Lame;Stopped charging in under 2 months
1.0 out of 5 stars;Failed quickly;Quit working after 1 month
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice;Ok for the money
5.0 out of 5 stars;excellent quality;Exactly what I wanted
1.0 out of 5 stars;Don't waste your money;This is a very long phone charger. It looks great and durable but it does not charge. I had my phone on the charger for an hour in it. Never charged over 1%
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great buy;Love it!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Good for only a few months;I've only had it for a few days but it looks like it will last. So far happy with my purchase.Update: It only lasts a few months and then it will stop charging even though the battery notification will state that it is charging. Not happy, especially now when it takes forever to get anything shipped.It went from a five to a two.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped working after a month;This is clearly cheaply made. It took less than a month for it to stop fast charging...I swapped out another cable for it to make sure the issue was with the cable and not my phone.Also its waaaaay too long. Not something you can carry out. Which would still be okay if it worked.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Bad Product;These cords do not work at all. I plug them into my phone and it either won't charge or does it very slowly. Do not buy this.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Quit working at 1 month mark;So I bought this on December 1st. Worked good up until now (December 28th) charger only works when you fidget it at just the right spot. If it wasn't for that, this would be an easy 5 star review. Love the length and it's fast charge compatible. The durability needs improvement. It's plugged in now and nothing.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Burned out;The cord was the right length but it got hot 🔥 and burned out!!😣😣😣
2.0 out of 5 stars;please make sure to ask questions if its really good.;Does not charge fast like it says it did. It's been charging for 28 minutes and it haven't went up yet  its charges slow.
1.0 out of 5 stars;The charger cable barely can even charge my pixel 2xl;I liked that it held up but I don't like the way that you have to push the cord in a certain way and it charged my phone super duper slow at 80 mah which is super super super duper duper duper duper slow and it was charging my phone but the battery was going down while it was charging my pixel 2xl
2.0 out of 5 stars;I got this for my computer and it did nothing.;Did not charge my laptop- which was why I bought it.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Didn't last a Year;Thought this would be a durable charger that would last.  Didn't last a year.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not Fast;These still take almost 2 hrs to charge my phone.
1.0 out of 5 stars;It works for a while;I had this cable for a few months now and reached the point where it is nearly impossible for me to charge my phone.  sometimes it disconnects if you move it even a little but most of the time my phone says to check the charger connection from testing other chargers it was the cord that has a problem
1.0 out of 5 stars;Its okay for a ten footer;It worked great in the beginning, but about 3 weeks in the fast charging stopped working. Another 2 weeks and the casing for the plug-in came off the end.  It still works but takes forever to fully charge my phone.  Takes about 6 hours vs the normal 2 hours.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Lasted 5 months;Worked fine 4 mos. Then charged less and less regularly. Now not at all.  Loose wire in head?

2.0 out of 5 stars;Not sturdy or dutable;I bought thi cable 3 montns ago and already has false contacts I tried it on several devices with same results. Looks like a wire in thr conector broke.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not a good fit;Had this for a little over a month. It now says it charges slowly and it won't stay connected in the port.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works great;Very sturdy and long
1.0 out of 5 stars;I am disappointed that after less than 6 weeks use the charging time has doubled.;After less than 6 weeks use this device is taking twice as long to charge my phone and tablet. I'm not happy with this purchase at all.**Update: barely 2 months later this charger no longer works. Don't waste your money
2.0 out of 5 stars;Defective;I ordered two of these.  One works the other does not plug in properly and would not make contact with the iPad.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Amazing cord to bring to the hospital but...;I got this cord when I knew I would be in the hospital having a baby. The length was absolutely amazing, but the consistency of the charge failed miserably. It doesn't even work anymore, and I've only used it for a month.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Good, but only for a couple months;Worked great but after just a few months it no longer has fast charge. Now it takes about 8 hrs to charge my phone.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Broke right after the return date expired;Lasted only a month, buy somewhere else

2.0 out of 5 stars;Not worth it!;Not worth it! Bought it 2 months ago an it no longer fast charges! Will say it need 20+ hours to fully charge from low battery!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped working in less than 2 weeks.;Loved it at first, charged quickly less than 2 weeks of owning it even though it's not exposed or damaged in anyway went from fast charging to barely detectable on my S21, switched chargers to a different charging cord and it worked. Terrible quality.
1.0 out of 5 stars;SO slow - buy the Apple one instead;This charger takes HOURS to charge my Macbook Pro. It was on 20%, plugged into this cord and not being used, and only got up to 50% in THREE HOURS. A total waste of money. I am buying an authentic apple cord next time, I suggest you do as well.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Total waste of money!!;Well it lasted about 2 weeks!I think that says it all!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Had a shorter life span than my dogs chew toys.;"It worked great for a week, max. Then I started getting ""Check charger connection"" messages. It would either take insanely long to charge or it wouldn't charge at all, even if it was fully connected to the phone. Like I said, my dogs chew toys lasted longer."
1.0 out of 5 stars;2 month lifetime;"After two months it's already failing so hard. It makes the ""charger is not connected properly"" pop up even tho it's perfectly conected."

2.0 out of 5 stars;Only lasted 4 months;Bought this in June and it worked great.  All of a sudden it stopped charging my phone.  I know it is the cord because I used other charging cords and they work
1.0 out of 5 stars;Yeah it did not work;I thought i had bought a really nice charger. it is metallic and it does not seem to break. I used it for 2 days and my cellphone stopped recognizing it. then i realized it came from china. very cheap product.

2.0 out of 5 stars;Works Great! For 1 week -_-;"Product worked amazingly and charged my android extremely fast! For less than a week...now it takes hours for a full charge and my phone alerts me that it is ""slow-charging"" due to an error with the cord. Would not recommend"
1.0 out of 5 stars;Stops working after 2 weeks;This charger is trash. So bad. I purchased it maybe 2 weeks ago and it seems to have such bad shorts in the wires or w/e. All I know is, it's no longer working and I'm so annoyed cuz I wasted my money 😤 😒 😑 🙄
1.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charge;Always charges slowly, not normal speed let alone fast. Annoying.
1.0 out of 5 stars;NeverLast;This is the 3rd cord I've ordered. They charge great the first day. Then my phone no longer recognizes the cord and charging slows or it stops charging all together. Other cords I have work so I know it is not my phone or plug.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Barely charge;Dont waste your money!  These cords barely charge!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not worth it;Usb c plug was defective after 2 weeks of use. Thought it was my phone port. Went and bought a charger at best buy. It plugged in and fit perfectly. Don't waste your money
1.0 out of 5 stars;Started having problems in a week;Worked perfectly at first but within a week phone kept saying check connection, check connection but all my other cords work so therefore this cord is the problem. Can't believe it stopped working in less than 7 days what a rip off
1.0 out of 5 stars;Failed in 3 Weeks;USB C end of the cable no longer consistently stays connected to phone. Has led to phone not charging over night several times in just 3 weeks. Other USB C cables still work reliably and consistently with the same phone.
2.0 out of 5 stars;not great;sucks at charging my phone :( it says it will take 32 hours to fully charge my phone
5.0 out of 5 stars;Long ass cable;Didn't realize exactly how long this cable is.  Very handy.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Garbage!;Only lasted 6 months then broke.  Annoying that it is so long.  Not worth the price.  I can't even return it now.  Garbage!  Pure garbage! Sad!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Do not buy this.;I gave this cord 2 separate opportunities to work. I bought one and it broke and stopped charging. I returned it, exchanged it for a nee one,  and it broke again (not charging).  It is literally stationary behind my bed to charge my phone at night.  I would like my money back.  You obviously sell faulty equipment.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Terrible;cable quite working after a few months
2.0 out of 5 stars;Surprised....;Didn't like that it did not come with a wall plug, so I can't use it

1.0 out of 5 stars;Not safe for MacBook Pro;This kept making my laptop shut down during use and not turn on. So once I took it out my laptop and inserted the original cord, I no longer had the issues of my laptop turning off during usage while charged. RETURNING ASAP!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Didn't work;Did not work
1.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped working within 2 months of use.  Poorly constructed. Pretty disappointed.;"The cord stopped charging properly shortly after I bought it.  A piece is loose.

1.0 out of 5 stars;Trash. Utter trash. Returned 3 different cables and bought a different brand. Will never charge.;I bought 1 and it didn't charge after a day. I ordered a replacement, the replacement didn't charge. Opened the 2nd one that came with it and it didn't charge. Swapped plugs, swapped devices, and it is 100% the cable.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Cable;I like the braided cords because they hold up well. Thanks so much for prompt delivery
1.0 out of 5 stars;Does not work;Absolute crud. It's only been several months and the product no longer works at all. In fact the last time I tried it the phone was at 69%. Charged it for about 40 mins with no apps running and not using it and it went DOWN 3%! Used my original charger and done in the same time frame. Was great with the length but if it won't charge what good is it? DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR YOUR MONEY!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't charge well!;This charger doesn't work well. The length of the cord is nice but the charging power is horrible.

1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't charge;Love the length.  However when plugged into the fast charger adapter the phone continues to loose battery WHEN PLUGGED IN! This happens both when phone is off and in use. Returning item, not worth it, finding a different product!

2.0 out of 5 stars;Don't buy;Not worth the money it stop working
1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't fit snugly;I loved the idea of this- a long cord to use for my phone charger. Unfortunately, it didn't work for me. The male part of the plug is too loose. It wasn't snug enough to fit on the female piece so the charger failed to hold a charge. Disappointing and doesn't seem worth the hassle of returning it. I'd just recommend not buying it in the first place.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Heavy duty, sturdy! It broke the charging port on my Motorola G7 Power. To sturdy?;I had intentions to use the type c charging cord for charging my Motorola G7 Power. The braded wire makes it where the cord isn't flimsy. It was made to well. To strong. I'm going to have to buy a new phone or replace the charging port.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Love it;Thank you love it. Nice if it was in Pink LOL
1.0 out of 5 stars;Fully Incompatible with Apple products;I have a 10ft USB type-A to USB type-C cable. Nice build and materials, but the cable doesn't charge either iPad Pro or iPad Air 4th gen (2020). I'm connecting it to a USB 3.2 Gen 2 port that other shorter USB type-A to USB type-C cables work on charging iPad Pro/Air 4th gen.UPDATE: Received a replacement and still doesn't charge at all iPads. It's not that it doesn't charge fast, it doesn't charge iPads at all.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't work. Ordered 2- neither worked at all.;Either I had horrible luck, or this is just a bad product. Ordered one- it didn't work. As part of my return, I exchanged the bad one for a new one. The new one didn't work either.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't work;Does not charge 2 different Samsungs it reports to work in. Plugs in - does nothing. My phone is on 19% as I type this so you don't buy it too. It's a p.o.s. for sure.

2.0 out of 5 stars;Not great;Slow charge

1.0 out of 5 stars;Lasted less than a month;At first this cord worked awesome. Like any charger cord should. Then, it started dramatically slowing down. At this point, I can have it plugged in all night and wake up to 45%. Really not good. Don't waste your money or time.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Received used cord;1st one lasted almost a year, was great. Just received a new & it's used. Thumbs down

1.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped Working After 1 Month;Initially, this charger worked great. It was fast charging and provided enough length that I didn't feel tied to an outlet.  However, I purchased this charger on January 16, and now on February 17, it does not charge my phone. I keep getting an error message to check the chargers connection. My phone was rapidly losing battery while plugger in to this charger. Huge disappointment.

1.0 out of 5 stars;Looks ARE deceiving!;I don't transport my charger. It stays on my night stand and at the end of the day, I charge my phone overnight.

1.0 out of 5 stars;Stoped fast charging w/ light use over 6 months;We ordered 2 of these worked great at first but with light use 6 months later it will not fast charge anymore using stock samsung fast charging wall plug
1.0 out of 5 stars;It is not reinforced on the connectors as advertised.;Not as pictured.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Keep plugging it back in;Not sure if it is just me but the cord falls out of the port on the phone. The length is decent along and the material of the cord and power supply seems to be just fine. My issue is when the charger is plugged in it just falls out randomly while not being touched which is a tad annoying. Sometimes I wake up and my alarm didn't go off because my phone is dead from the cord falling out when it should have been fully charged. I have already moved along and bought a new one.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Just what was needed.;Good cord.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Charges yes, rapid not really;While it charges my Kindle, it's quite slow.  However, I did get a second cord in my package and we'll see if it works better.
5.0 out of 5 stars;love the look;perfect length and style.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't maintain connection;If it's not sitting JUST SO in the phone, it doesn't charge.  Kinda useless.  Th length is nice but if it's not charging, what's even the point?
1.0 out of 5 stars;Don't Bother;These cords suck. They don't even last a month before they just stop charging. Do yourselves a favor and get a different cord.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Do not last for long;Two out of three already have a short in them and do not charge.  Waste of money
1.0 out of 5 stars;BROKE FIRST TIME;Only used this cord once, went to use it again and discovered the USB end had broke.Very disappointed because I liked it.Had it less then 2 days befor it broke.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Dissatisfied;Doesn't work 😕 anymore.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Junk;Never charged at all. Thought I was charging phone for next day. How would you like to go all day with no phone?
1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't charge my phone anymore;Doesnt work went  out and broke no longer charges my phone
1.0 out of 5 stars;Didn't last long;Super disappointed with this product! It's supposed to be a fast charging cable but after 2 months of usage, it went from fast charging to super slow charging!The picture I provided shows that I'm at 86% but it takes 51 minutes to charge to full! On other occasions if my phone is lower than 30 percent, it'll even show that itll take 5-12hrs to charge to full! I can't even use my phone sometimes while ite charging because the percentage will go down WHILE its charging depending on what I'm doing. What a waste of money. Now in stuck buying another one.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Breaks in under 2 months of light use.;I received a cable and it stopped working almost immediately so I contacted Amazon to send me a replacement. I figured it was a fluke. This one broke after a few weeks and I've just found out that they charged me full price for the replacement of their trash product. So now I've paid twice and still can't charge my phone. Don't waste your time or money.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn’t like my MacBook;It doesn’t like to charge my Mac unless it’s closed. I continue to lose charge when I am working on my Mac. But it charges when I close it.

5.0 out of 5 stars;Nice charger!;This is a great charger! It actually kinda clicks in so it doesn't get pulled out if you're moving it around while charging. The cord is durable and long!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not an O.E.M. cord.;Tried to charge my note 20 ultra overnight and only 44 percent in the morning.  Don't waste your money.

4.0 out of 5 stars;Slow;Pretty slow charger
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good stuff!!;Good job…
1.0 out of 5 stars;Didn't last a minth;I used it on the side of my bed so I could charge my phone at night and still have access to it without having to use a really short core but it didn't even last a month doesn't charge anymore
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great charging at a great price;This is a pretty quality cable I would recommend it to anyone looking for a replacement or longer cable.

5.0 out of 5 stars;Very happy;Nice charging cord
5.0 out of 5 stars;Both cables are great & meet my needs and very happy;Both cables are great & meet my needs and very happy

5.0 out of 5 stars;good bet;as advertised
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great quality;Great quality charging cord. No complaints.
1.0 out of 5 stars;I need to CHARGE  my PHONE!;It worked for just 32 days, and it was very slow. It just can't charge my Samsung Galaxy Note 9.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Both cables stopped working 1 month each;"I have gotten cables before that have lasted for half a year and longer but these didn't last at all. These ""charge your phone"" but doesn't charge them at all. The symbol appears but they ain't charging nothing. And I tried using my laptop to charge my phone and it doesn't charge either. soooo I would recommend these if you are in a pinch but not for the long run."
5.0 out of 5 stars;It was just what I wanted;Very handy because of the long length.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not happy;The charger piece fell out
1.0 out of 5 stars;Don't last long;Had to replace them already they do not last long..
4.0 out of 5 stars;A good product;I liked the product it works well.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice length, Could be more durable.;So I'm writing this review after owning this charger for 3 months. The length is perfect and that was my biggest interest, my use for it made for minimal interaction and mostly included plugging and unplugging a mounted device. As of this review I'm having connectivity issues. The cable still works, but you have to find the right spot. This is alright for now because I use it for mounted devices, but had this been for my more hands on devices I'd be more irritated. I expect the cable to stop working overall in the next few months. Better than it catching on fire or smoking, but I'd hoped for at least a years use before needing a replacement. Luckily the price wasn't bad. Can't recommend, but it wasn't bad in prime condition. 10/10 on the delivery though.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Garbage. Used like a week. Cord now wont charge;Not worth the money
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good for 4 months;I was really excited with this cord when I first purchased it. It worked great from October until now (February) the cord is now draining my battery as I charge it. I do have two cats that enjoy chewing cords and although I see signs of chewing, the cords have not been exposed, etc. Great charger for 4 months and cheap, so I get what you pay for!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Excellent length;It lasted on two months. Otherwise it works great. Excellent length but didnt last long at all.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Work great, perfect length;Great length, quick charge
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works great long cord length fast charging;Great for the price, love how fast it charged.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Like;Like
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging as advertised;I plugged in my phone at 8pm checked at 2am and was only on 42%.  I purchased on from the tjmax for the same price and it fully charged in one hour.  Don't buy this
5.0 out of 5 stars;Phone charger;Fast delivery and just in time. I broke my charging cord. Thanks.
4.0 out of 5 stars;It worked fine 1st couple days, now it's on and off when it wants to work properly;Length is good. Durable but the charging is sporadic. Not too satisfied with it's charging capability.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Excellent charging.;Works well in combination with a fast charging adapter. The length fits my needs
1.0 out of 5 stars;False advertising;This is not made for a note 10 as it is described in the status. False information.Update: now this works for my note 8 and other c cable devices and not made for note 10 because the ends are different and I was looking for a note 10 charging cable. Note 10 uses c to c cable.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Fast. Great length;Sturdy, fast, flexibility to move around
5.0 out of 5 stars;Durará toda la vida;Excelente, durará toda la vida
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good item;I really iked how sturdy it looks and feels
5.0 out of 5 stars;My mom love it;Buy it you won’t regret it
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great cable.;I needed a longer cable to charge my phone, perfect. Heavier duty than normal cables.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Defective charger;Terrible. I've never had a defective charger until this one. My phone keeps shutting down for to zero battery life WHILE it's plugged in and supposedly charging. I did check to confirm it was plugged in adequately.  Ridiculous.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great quality;returning one because I really dont need two and didnt realize I had put 2 in cart
5.0 out of 5 stars;very fast;High quality
3.0 out of 5 stars;Lasted only 8 months;I really liked this product, especially it's length. However, it did not last a year. I previously purchased the 5 ft model. It did not work as long as expected either. Hate that Samsung changed to this plug on the S20, omitting the headphone jack. But the inferior chargers make it worse and even more expensive.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good charger;Very good charger for under 15 bucks. Especially for a Type-C
3.0 out of 5 stars;Defective;Charger didn't work long enough
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great;Great
5.0 out of 5 stars;Won't tangle;Fast charging doesn't tangle bright color to find easy
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not sure.;It was OK the first day the following day wouldn't charge keep saying something was wrong with the charger. Check your charger.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good product;I needed an extra charging cord to have for traveling, at the office, and for the living room. This cord work great for what I need it for. Its very durable because of the material used and the length is perfect. I am never worried about not having enough length with this cord. I can have my phone plugged into it and not feel like I am tugging on the cord.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great charger, no turbo charge;While it does not have turbo charge, it is a good charger with enough length to reach to another room.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good Long Cord;It works well.... the covering thread separated from the base of the plug nearest the phone plug-in area.  It still works, and it is 10 feet long, which is what I needed.
5.0 out of 5 stars;It works better for home use and recharges super fast;This works so much better than the plastic/rubber cord that came with my phone. It does not tangle, it has  more secure and sturdy metal connections and recharges much faster than the original one. The only drawback is that since the cord is wrapped it will not be as easy as the more flimsy ones that are not covered, to wind up for packing. I use this one for home and the thinner one for travel...problem solved.8/4/2021: After reading some of the reviews about possibly causing possible overheating and possible fire while charging, I will keep an eye on my phone while charging and not charge it overnight or when I am away from it.
5.0 out of 5 stars;This cord rocks;It is perfect
2.0 out of 5 stars;Lasted a few months. No longer charges.;It charged on the slower side when it was brand new. Now it doesn't charge at all and the gray piece just beyond the charger head, actually slid off completely. So it is falling apart. I haven't gotten a new charger yet (I just keep forgetting until I go to bed at night, but there's others around), but I will not be repurchasing.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Could have used much shorter cable;Charging
5.0 out of 5 stars;Type C charger just perfect;I needed a long cable for charging my phone and this one is perfect.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Didn't fit my phone;I searched for a S9 galaxy charger but when I received the cord that rad advertised to work with my phone.  To my surprise it was to small.  I have to use it on the charger pad.
5.0 out of 5 stars;A gift;Worked good for my disabled sister
4.0 out of 5 stars;Not a high performance cable!;22.5 hrs to fully charge is not high performance.
5.0 out of 5 stars;It was better than I expected.;It is really long and made of high quality material.
1.0 out of 5 stars;No Longevity, Cheap Materials;Worked amazing for about 2 1/2 weeks. I was so happy with my purchase. But then the charger slowly started having problems which led to constant warnings of a slow connection. I tried a new base, different outlets, and even a computer. Same result every time. The cord looks sturdy and built to last yet mine is already fraying and I take very good care of my charger as I work in healthcare and need to have a charged phone. Sad that I have to now order a new one from someone else. I hope others have better experience than I did, just keep this review in mind.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Disappointed;I purchased this item in preparation for a hospital stay and was very disappointed that it would not charge my phone properly and almost damaged my phone. Disappointed and hoping to be able to return.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped working after 2 months;Not good
2.0 out of 5 stars;Disappointed;Had this charger for 2 months. Worked fine to begin with but broke pretty fast.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good product;Cable good quality
5.0 out of 5 stars;Excellent;Good price
4.0 out of 5 stars;Long boy;Seems heavy duty enough. It does fast charge with Samsung brick.
4.0 out of 5 stars;like it so far.;Sturdy and fast charging.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good 👍;Good 👍
2.0 out of 5 stars;Broke after 60 days;This was a wonderful charging cable while it lasted. It. Broke after about 58 days, so I can't replace it.
5.0 out of 5 stars;FAST CHARGING LOVE IT;My second to buy love it, charges twice as fast, long charging cord, can use it, and charge at same time
5.0 out of 5 stars;6 inches;I was really looking for a 9.5 foot cable but just like this cable I always appreciate an extra 6 inches
1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn’t work;Didn’t work from day one
5.0 out of 5 stars;Slow;It charges slowly but get the job done
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great length;Nice and long.  Great value for money.  Received timely as promised.  Seems durable haven't had much time with it yet.  I would recommend it to anyone.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Amazing charging cable;This is a great charging cable very strong and a long cord so if your away from a outlet that's not close it's no problem with this
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging;Not fast charging
2.0 out of 5 stars;Just stopped working one day.;It worked for awhile and then one day it just completely stopped working.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Nice a long;Length was what we were good for but extra covering on cable was great
5.0 out of 5 stars;A friend;It’s made of good quality
3.0 out of 5 stars;Basic/ not fast;I thought the “fast charging” in the title would be similar to a lightning cable, but unfortunately it is not. It isn’t even fast. My device was charging at slow/normal capacity with it. It would even pop up and say so. I do like the sturdiness of the cable and the length. So it works as a basic cable. Nothing fast about it though.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works as described;Length makes charging convenient.  Amazing how fast it charges.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Efficiency;Love the length
2.0 out of 5 stars;Does not fast charge;At first, the cables worked well and my phone stated it was fast charging. However, soon the one I was using most started saying cable charging instead. I had to replug it a few times to get fast charging so I tolerated it. But now it never says fast charging even when I replug it. Sometimes itll say I have to check the charging connection. The second one I barely used so i knew it worked and sometimes I would use it when I needed my phone to charge quickly. However, my phone now says I need to check the connection with it too. It broke faster than the one I was regularly using. I wouldn't recommend these. The only good thing is the length but thats no use if my phone won't charge.

2.0 out of 5 stars;Cable Smoking;I purchased cable in July 2020. I was using the cable on my tablet and got message for possible bad cable. A couple of days ago, the cable started smoking. I would not purchase this brand again

5.0 out of 5 stars;Tough and durable;This charging cord was better than expected. My puppy tried to chew on it any it made no difference. I love how sturdy it is. It charges fast too
2.0 out of 5 stars;poor quality;it broke as i put the port in my phone i had to get a pair of pliers to pull that little thing out of my phone wasted my money on this and i neeeded to get another one

2.0 out of 5 stars;Disappointed;Does not rapid charge with my pixel 5 and has to be at the correct angle to charge
4.0 out of 5 stars;Usb-c cord;I use this cord for my cellphone.  I didn't realize how long the cord would be til I got it home. But it is very sturdy.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good buy;Perfect length, it really does fast charge, the braid is smooth and doesn’t tangle or hard bend
4.0 out of 5 stars;So far so good!;So far these chords are great. They fixed my Android Auto problem! I can't speak for durability because I just got them, but they seem pretty sturdy. The only bummer is that I wanted the 3 ft. and apparently I ordered the 6 ft. which reaches almost to my trunk. Other than that I'm really happy so far!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Very Good Cable but...;The cable is great but, it dont fit good with the phone, if you charge the cell and dont move it, the cable is greate for you, however if you use the cell while them is charging the cable unplug sometimes.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Very good cables and excellent customer service;Good durable cables of good length.I had one cable eventually give out on me and the seller easily replaced it under warranty. It arrived 2 days after I contacted them. That is exceptional customer service.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Love the longer legnth!;length! Have been buying 3 ft cables forever, always too short to use when charging. Decided to get longer cables this time and they work great. I have only had them a few weeks, I cant say how durable yet.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Seems good.;Too soon to tell on function. It works and looks nice. It's a cable.
4.0 out of 5 stars;These work just fine.;I bought these because my wife is very hard on them. I cringe every time I see her plugging it in, and especially when she Jenks it out of her tablet. OUCH. I complain and her answer is, I'M TAKING IT EASY ON THEM. Ans I think, yea right.
4.0 out of 5 stars;They work!;I've ordered several cables lately from different brands and they either didn't work or they only charged too slow to even have my phone powered on. So, I went back to the brand and seller I've used for years! Thanks for keeping the quality and price even through this economy!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works.  Good price;So far so good
4.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging;Love the length and the strength of the cord. However, it is not really fast charging. I have other cables that are fast charging and this one adds an additional hour for the same charge. Disappointed but still a decent cord.
5.0 out of 5 stars;As described;As described
4.0 out of 5 stars;You need em;get little cords, too short is the problem. They work great , just wont reach the back seat
5.0 out of 5 stars;High Quality;Nothing lasts forever, but this cord lasts longer than any other that I have used. Only had to replace it because I leave one at work and it really gets abused. The others I have are still working.
4.0 out of 5 stars;I like the charger, it not too long,not too short,it charges the phone but not fast.;I really like the phone charger,I keep one at home and one in my car. I like that 2  chargers came in the pack...good value for the price.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Husband happy;Bought 2 different chargers for my husband , he liked this one cause the other one took too long to charge
4.0 out of 5 stars;great product, easy install;Nothing really to say it works as expected, nice design and well put together

5.0 out of 5 stars;Best for my Samsung Note 9;After trying numerous times to find a durable, fast charging cord for my Samsung Note 9 I found this! Thank You! Fast charging! Perfect fit! Durable! Ordering again!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Durable, made to last;Replaced a worn cable and looks good too
4.0 out of 5 stars;Calidad.;Por su precio  el cable se ve genial y carga muy bien.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Thick cord seems sturdy. Doesn't seem to charge fast, like it said.;Doesn't charge fast but compared to the dozens of cords that I have had where the wires show after a month or two, these cords seem like they will be sturdy.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Happy;Work great. Con. cord wrapped gets caught on things easy
5.0 out of 5 stars;Solid cables;Don't know how to expand on this review, as I don't have enough tech knowledge to break it down, so:They work. Have enough speed for my Quick Charger. I've yet to test the speed with a reader, but my devices recognize how fast it is.Braided cord is sturdy, and the rubber buildup at the ends helps keep them from kinking.The USB-C port seems strong. I've yanked it hard by accident a couple times, when I was pretending my phone was a nunchuck, and it didn't bend.Looks like a race car with that sleek red and black coloring baby, yeah.What else can I really say? It's an inexpensive charging cord that works.I guess it's strong enough to be used as a garrote wire if you're so inclined.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Charges my Samsung S8;Used at work and does what it is supposed to do!  No complaints!!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Just what I needed thank you;Works very well
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works great!;Great cable durable. 4th set I've ordered. Family loves them
5.0 out of 5 stars;Stylish rugged braided cables;I bought the USB C for my Android. I like them so much I'm going to get some for my Apple products. I like the different colors, I use the different colored cables to keep them organized for different charging duties.
5.0 out of 5 stars;A decent charger cord, no complaints so far;A decent charger cord, it's durable and reliable
4.0 out of 5 stars;Muy bueno y durable;Duración de uso una años o más
4.0 out of 5 stars;Usb cord;Fast charging but too short for my preference.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Met all the claims in the ad.;We bought these for the cord length and flexibility.  Working well.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Second time happy;I bought a second pair and happy with both the purchases. Excellent cable - long lasting durable and fast. Definite yes!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Best USB-C Cord on Amazon;2x purchasing this cord set. I still have one cord left from the set I purchased almost 3yrs ago and it's my car charger.  The other was a house charger but I think it gave out because the kids keep yanking and twisting the cord around.All around great product and very well made.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good Charging speed. Recommended;It looks to be good quality. I am getting good charging speed on my phone using these cables.
5.0 out of 5 stars;It's a great way to charge my phone. It charges it way faster than my old one!;I love it!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Wonderful Product!;This is my second purchase. My first one was about 2 years ago and those are still going strong!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Disappoint it did not have the plug in part, but it is great that it's long and fast!;I liked the length, durability and quickness of the charge. Didn't realize it had no plug in part for the wall socket. Fortunately, I had a spare.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Excellent;Excellent
5.0 out of 5 stars;Long lasting, charge fast, durae;I bought this back in April 2021 and I came back September 2022 to leave a review on how good this thing is. I gave the second wire it came with to my cousin and honestly I still don't need that second wire. This thing is fkn durable..I am not a gentle person. My family calls me bear. I'm clumsy and don't do things with grace. I have tugged on this, tripped on it, scrunched and stuffed it in a bag, etc and this thing still charges mf fast, AND there's no rips anywhere. It still charges as good as the day it was delivered and the length is honestly perfect for most situations. Not too little that ur tugging but not too long that it's everywhere. Best fkn wire dude hands down. If u were looking before, look no further. Little red wires my beloved
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good power cords.;I really like these charging cords. They are fast and come in various lengths.  The only problem I have is the bumb out. It interferes with my ability to charge my phone in the case. Some of the cables have the bump out and some of them do not. If you are looking for charging cables and have a waterproof/dustproof case make sure you pay attention to the structure of the charging cable.
3.0 out of 5 stars;IDK;I wouldn't say these are fast charging.  My fast charging cord with the same specs charges my s22 ultra in 1 hour 18 minutes from 1 percent. These cord take 2.5 hours.  They work just not how I expected them
3.0 out of 5 stars;Questionable durability;Bought this product because of the reviews.  The description stated the most durable cable due to its construction.  Yet, the cabling broke and stuck me in the finger on both cords!I come from an era when manufacturing was in the USA and products were built to last - not anymore!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Does NOT fast charge Galaxy s21+;I bought this cable almost a year ago (January 2022) and it finally stopped working on November 3rd 2022. It did fast charge and no matter how low my battery was (I rarely go below 32%)  it always took between 35-55 minutes for a full charge. I would even use it while charging and it still fast charged it. So I  immediately repurchased this same cable.This is NOT the same cable except by appearance only. The fastest it will charge is 1h and 15 minutes. Even at 88%, it still takes over an hour and if I use my phone while charging, it's like it stops charging as the battery never increases. I thought maybe it was my power block as I've been using the same block that came with my old s10+ phone. I used 3 different Samsung blocks, including the brand new s21+ block, and it didn't change a thing. When I went back to the product description, it specifically leaves out the s21/21+ so maybe other models will work. But it does not on this.
4.0 out of 5 stars;The product is ok but missing elasticity;Too long and it is not elastic
3.0 out of 5 stars;Stiff;The cables work fine but they are very stiff and retain the bent shape they came in.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good product;Like
3.0 out of 5 stars;Very good quality;"Excellent quality,  good length,  nice appearance.  They don't seem to be ""fast charging"" as advertised."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Is not fast charging;I ordered this cable to replace the one that came with my Samsung Galaxy Book because it said it is fast charging. It is not!! My laptop can be plugged up for hours and still only charge half way. This laptop is less than 6 mths old.
4.0 out of 5 stars;It performs as advertised.  Easy to use and gives a quick change.;The length is just right, a recharges quickly.
4.0 out of 5 stars;UPDATE: Worst chargers ever;UPDATE: Seller contacted me promptly after leaving the review here. They sent out new chargers without asking for me to return the defective ones. While the chargers still won't work on the Google Pixel we have, every other device fast charges as it's supposed to. The incompatibility with the Pixel is a bummer, but overall they did a great job correcting the issue.These chargers are terrible. While they are long, they don't charge well at all. I had my phone plugged in over night, and it only charged from 23% to 26% over the course of 6 hours. I switched to a different charger and I was at full battery within 2 hours. I won't be purchasing again.
3.0 out of 5 stars;As expected;Does what I expect.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Solid cables.  Fast charging;Got these as extras soSo could have charging available in multiple rooms.  They are perfect length to move around with and charge very fast.  The braided cords are heavy duty and feel solid.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Worked;Works
3.0 out of 5 stars;3 stars;I give this 3 stars only because my regular samsung charger would say fast charging on my phone but this charger doesn't an I don't think it's a fast charger from what I noticed there no indication of fast charging
3.0 out of 5 stars;Don’t work it’s iJoy headphones;Theses do not work with iJoy headphones
3.0 out of 5 stars;S8+ not so hot;I bought these for my sending S8+. It takes 18 hours to charge for about 50 battery. Oh well. Guess I'll try something else.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Decent enough;It’s what I need for now, had it less than a month and it’s starting to wear and eventually catch fire like the last pair.
4.0 out of 5 stars;High amp charging at 6ft at a great price!;I actually bought these hoping the long length would reduce the changing speed for my phone. It pretty much worked.  We have some high amp chargers with short cords that make the phones hard to use while charging (probably not good for the phone either). These seem to have fixed almost all those issues. The length is ridiculously long for my use, but the cables feel very well made. When these charging cables fail, the problem always seems to be at the C-end charging port, so I'll be adding extra shrink wrap to firm that up and hopefully these will last longer than the phone.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Lasted a little over a year;The cables lasted a little over a year before they started suffering connectivity issues at the USB C side.
4.0 out of 5 stars;One has failed already;Length and color are great. Durability, not so much... One has failed. It won't charge my phone or tablet anymore.
3.0 out of 5 stars;They're decent, but the cord is kinda stiff;The cord is wrapped in a stiff material, so it is not flexible! I dont think they're too good to use in cars because it seems like the car doesn't recognize the cord or something, but that could be my vehicle.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great USB C charger;Very practical, allows me to charge my phone quickly and from a distance outlet.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Solid cables;These are solid cables.  They're not the best, but they're not the worst.I've used them for a while now, and they still work.  The durability is alright.  They braiding starts getting frayed pretty quickly, and the chord cluster inside of it starts to bend in weird ways, but they still work.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Lasts forever. Bought a year ago;These charger cables are 10/10. I bought these 11/23/21 and its now 11/6/22 and I haven't even had to pull out the second cable yet. I use it every single day, including moving it between rooms/work etc. Really amazing and worth the price.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Well made, but will not charge as fast as original;pros - appears very well constructed, and should last.  low pricecons - the main reason I purchased these was to replace the original charging cord for my OnePlus android phone.  However, it charges approximately 1/3 as fast as the original cord.If you want a durable cord and are not concerned with speed of charging, it would be a good choice. If you want fast-charging like you have with your original equipment, not so much.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good Quality and as described;Great cables. work great.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Works with Samsung 22 but not Google Pixel3;Works with Samsung 22, but Google Pixel3 just registers it was plugged in but doesn't charge. I'll get something else.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Just what I needed for my car usb ports;Needed the cables for my new car so people could have enough cord and charge their device while in the car
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great;Fast charging and durable
4.0 out of 5 stars;Buen producto;La llegada del del producto fue antes del tiempo programado, tiene excelente apariencia exterior, lo que hace creer que la calidad es optima (según tejido de refuerzo), su longitud es muy buena para la mayoría de aplicaciones (hogar, carro, etc).
4.0 out of 5 stars;The most durable cords I found so far.;Good packaging. Although all USB charging/power/communication cords have a life expectancy, I found this product to be as good as it gets. The cord typically wears down at the neck where it enters the device connector. This happens more quickly if you are using your device and charging at the same time. This product has a rubber collar around the cord that prevents wear.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Have not had long enough to review;Great looking cable. Appears to be solidly built. Have not had it used long enough to give a thorough review
5.0 out of 5 stars;Just what I was looking for.;Accurate to the product description. Also has a strap for each cord to wrap it up.
3.0 out of 5 stars;One fast charges and the other one doesn't;I like the length of the charging cord and the one that works perfectly. Disappointed that one didn't fast charge. I can't speak for the durability as I haven't had them that long. Will update review later.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Its ok;I like the length of the cord, but it falls out of my phone easy. Even after cleaning out connector on the phone. It would awesome it would stay in good.
3.0 out of 5 stars;GOOD QUALITY/NOT COMPATIBLE WITH EVERYTHING!;Not compatible with everything! I hate that part because the cord definitely didn't work for what I ordered them for.Seems to be pretty durable!
3.0 out of 5 stars;ok;Does not seem any faster than original plug,guess i was expecting to much as samsung plug says fast charging on it
4.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't charge fast but dependable;The cord you use is only as good as the adapter output you use. Don't expect this to be fast charging by itself. What it does have is a great length and the texture of the cord is a draw. It's not flimsy like the standard issue chargers you get from your phone purchase. It's a good cord but fast charging by itself is a pretty big stretch. But it's affordable and good for everyday use.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Just bought the cord and charger. It works. Amazon should ask after 30 days,not right away!;Works as should. But should ask for reveiw after 30 days.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Garbage-Editrd 6/16/22;"Update: The seller had great communication and replaced the cords. When I did not receive the replacement, for whatever reason, they replaced it again. They closed the loop by making sure I received the item and was able to test that it worked. We will see how long they last, but I'm satisfied with the resolution!3 months old, and it stopped ""fast charging."" Tried multiple phones and it says ""slow charging"" on the phone. Sure we got a 2 pack, but the cord shouldn't be garbage after only 3 months. Very unhappy!"
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not a fast charger;Was specifically looking for a fast charger and this isn't it.To compare, my old fast charger got my phone from 16% to 43% in about 5-10 minutes. This charger got me from 13% to 16% in that time.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good, but not very long lasting;The length was great but after a couple months I noticed the charging took a lot longer than normal. I had to mind how the cord was laid out because if it was a little curved near the plug, it wouldn’t charge as well. But it was great for the time I had it, and worth what I paid for!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nothing Fast About These;"These are not ""fast charge"" cords. I was very disappointed when my phone notified me that my phone was slow charging. It was true. It took an hour and a half to fully charge from 60 to 100%. These cords are only good for overnight charging. I went back to using my shorter cord.UPDATE: This company obviously cares. They sent me 2 better cords. I will be most happy to buy their products in the future."
3.0 out of 5 stars;Charger cord;Should charge faster
3.0 out of 5 stars;Durable;Nice looking, durable cord and connectors. Great price...and a cord wrapper.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Lasted about a year. Not terrible.;When buying chargers, there are two things I look for. Fast charge, and lifespan. I bought these May 2021, and they made it to May 2022 before giving issues. Doesn't charge unless you plug it in a few times. One of them stops charging unless you hold the charger a certain way, most likely due to the position the phone is held while charging. Got a horizontal charger specifically for that reason. Good charger, decent lifespan.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Met expectations;I got what I expected
4.0 out of 5 stars;Okay purchase;Doesn't seem to charge as fast as others I've had.
4.0 out of 5 stars;NOT FAST CHARGING... IT IS LONG AND OVERALL FINE;SO IT'S DEFINITELY NOT FAST CHARGE CABLE - IT TAKES FOREVER TO CHARGE MY ONE PLUS SMARTPHONE.... BUT  ON THE PLUS SIDE, IT SEEMS DURABLE AND IS INDEED LONG.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Love these.;These were a great buy.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good quality C Cable but...;Like the company for chargers but this cable isn't fast charging its very slow. Thought because of it being a 3.1 C charging cable it would be better but no its slower than a 2.0.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Second time buying these! Great length!;My house is short on outlets, so I have to be creative plugging things in.  These are a big help.  They don't charge quite as fast as other
3.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charge;Does not charge fast.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Okay chargers;They are okay chargers. They didn't work with the fast blocks I ordered for them, but I think they were faulty blocks
4.0 out of 5 stars;Not for Apple;I should have known these wouldn't work on my Apple products but I saw and bought on impulse. Not for me.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good quality, like the length.;Seems like a good quality cord. My only complaint would be they are not very pliable, little more stiff than I like.
4.0 out of 5 stars;USB A to C charging cord;The description is right on point.  Works great!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Seems to work well;This is a durable cable (so far).  It's almost too thick.  It's flexible enough but I have a cord minder on the bedside and it's a tight fit.  I'll probably get something to replace this that fits the cord minder better and use this cord for other things.Of course, this is not the cord's fault.  It seems to work well enough.  Charges my new iPad just fine.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Love it;Love these cables. Used for charging a variety of gadgets and they always work and support fast charging depending on the device. the length comes in handy for traveling when oitlets arent ideally placed. One star off for them breaking faster than higher quality cables but for the price, no complaints!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good charger or the price;Overall I like the charger. If I’m actively using my ipad, it takes a very long time to charge. I use this charger mainly when I have my ipad plugged in at night when not in use.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Not bad;Only have had these cables a few weeks. Use one mainly to screen mirror android to pc. No complaints as of now. Length is decent and quality is actually superb. They are thick with that mesh/cloth covering. Each cord has a Velcro strap to bind it up and place in a drawer or bag.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Charges fast than old cords. Arrived quickly;To new to say 5 star so only did 4 so far they charge fast than any I've tried. They arrived very fast.
5.0 out of 5 stars;okay;alll good
3.0 out of 5 stars;Heads up, one cord is fast charging the other one is not.;Good quality cords and what I was looking for. But only one cord charges fast.1 hour for my phone to charge from 0 too 100%The other cord says it will take 8 hours from 30% to 100%.For the price tho it's better than gas station chargers.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't fast charge;It's nice to have a 6ft cord length with durable build, but the speed is significantly lower than what they claim.
5.0 out of 5 stars;It's a USB cable with a sheath on the outside that you can get in different colors.;Tired of cheap USB cables that fall apart? Get these. They come in nice colors. It's a USB cable. It's not exciting, and it shouldn't be. I usually order pink to keep people from stealing them.
5.0 out of 5 stars;These cords work perfectly;I use these cords at work so they get abused quite a bit and they're just as good as the day I got them. Very sturdy with great charging.
4.0 out of 5 stars;They last.;I keep buying these cables because they are good. I use them the most in my car and I've had the first pair that I bought from them for almost two years now and they're still good. I bought another set and got them for the other car and then a shorter backup pair. I really like these cables. They're tough. As long as they keep making them like this, I'll continue buying them.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Only one issue;The only problem with the cable is that it does not snap into the into the charging port. It does not connect well and falls out from minimal movement becuase of this. It would not connect well to my Samsung galaxy but otherwise works.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Best brand cable;You will be happy that you ordered USB-C to USB A Cable 3.1A Fast Charging [2-Pack 6.6ft], JSAUX USB Type C Charger Cord Compatible with Samsung Galaxy S10 S9 S8 S20 Plus A51 A12 A11, Note 10 9 8, PS5 Controller USB C Charger-Red for your cable needs.  And I love the red color.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Fast Charging;My phone stays charged longer and quicker
3.0 out of 5 stars;Cord stopped working after a short while.;Charging speed is ok, quality seemed good. Lasted a good bit before the cable stopped working. Didn't tangle easily which is nice.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Faster charging than factory cables;Faster charging than factory cables
4.0 out of 5 stars;Long enough to use.;These are pretty stiff but they are long enough to reach from a wall socket to a convenient desktop when needed.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect fit, sturdy, very well made indeed.;Perfect fit, sturdy, very well made indeed.The ends were firmly bonded to cord, making the perfect cords for my needs. Highly recommended.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect!;Second purchase of these cords from this vendor for additional devices! They are just GREAT!!!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Amazing! I'll always buy these!;Disclaimer: I receive no compensation for my review. This is all me, and I bought these myself.Tldr: buy these charging cords. They're awesome and last forever.These charging cables are absolutely incredible! I bought a set of two back in 2018. one for me and my SO, and they have literally lasted this long! Well, I did end up using both myself because he got a case for his phone that wouldn't work with them, but it still took two years before both cables died- about a year each. Which is honestly even better- one set of two cables will last two years!The only downside is the actual c-plug side- it won't fit with some specific phone cases, but it always fit my phone cases I had so I never cared. But wow! These cords are awesome- I have a cat and try as he might he can't bite through them at all! And they look so nice too!They definitely work with quick-charge as well. to be honest that's the only thing that wears out on them. The cord itself and the connectors are so sturdy that the only piece that finally fails is the actual c-plug itself, and that's after a year of pretty rough use! Even after that, it still charges for a while, just not the quick-charge.
3.0 out of 5 stars;It’s ok;It’s supposed to be a fast charger but I have to keep messing with it cause a message pops up on my tablet saying I need to check to make sure the cord is completely plugged in.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Charges Great!;First the length is perfect. Charges very well and especially fond of how durable it is.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Facil comprarli pir Amazon;Se ajustó a mi telefono y necesidades
5.0 out of 5 stars;Solid well made cable.;I'm sure these cables will last a long time as they are high quality and well made. Every usb cable I've had that broke was because the neck area very near the actual connector broke. These cables have a reinforced neck so it shouldn't break easily. My only complaint is the cables are very stiff and not super flexible which makes using my phone while plugged in awkward sometimes. So super durable but not super flexible like cheaper cables.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charging speed;Sturdy cord, long for me to be on the bed while charging it. However, really slow speed. Had to get a different brand.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great fast replacement;Works great
5.0 out of 5 stars;Thick wire , should last a long time. Good price.;Thick wire , should last a long time. Good price.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good Quality Construction;When I need cables for charging or data transfer I always buy ones from this manufacturer. I recommend there products, excellent quality.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Strong wire;Working well and the length is good enough
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfecto!;"Heavy Duty braided cable with rubber strain relief reinforcement. Unlike other (previously purchased) cables, these are built ""like a tank"" and even include velcro cable ties (not cheapo wire ties of other brands). So, what's not to like??? Perfection at a very reasonable price! 👍👍"
5.0 out of 5 stars;Best cable's i've used;Quick charges anything i hook up to it - cell phones, laptops, console controllers. it's great.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect for Pokemon Go;As a pokemon go player this is what I needed for my phone, they are still lasting months later which is a godsend.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not really fast charging...;Bought it because it said it was fast charging. Good quality.  But no different than any other regular cable I had and certainly not fast like a genuine fast charging Samsung cable.  Returned them.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good cords;Good selection of sizes and colors. They don't last forever, but will do the job for 2 to 3 years.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Happy with this purchase;Charges fast
3.0 out of 5 stars;Seems sturdy;Good length - not too short or too long when using on a desk.  Only time will tell if the connections hold up to daily bouts of charging for the Galaxy tablet
3.0 out of 5 stars;1 not working and 1 working;I bought this on Amazon about 1 year ago and 1 of them is working and 1 of them is not.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Heavy Duty well made charging cable.;It's the perfect length. I like the fact that I don't have to get out my charging cable and an extension cord.
4.0 out of 5 stars;REALLY LIKE SO FAR;I have only been using this JSAUX USB C charging cable for around 2 months & it works extremely well! You can get it in multiple colors & lengths also! The lengths you can get it in are 3 foot, 6 foot, & 10 foot! These cables are going to last a WHOLE LOT LONGER then your standard phone charging cable!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Two thumbs up;These are great.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Wish all my USB cables felt this sturdy;Bought a second set because I liked the first so well. The construction feels way more durable than the typical USB cable.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice charging cord.;Nice
4.0 out of 5 stars;It works very good;Great products to buy works very well
5.0 out of 5 stars;Attractive, functional, sturdy.;Item is as described and fits the purpose very well, not anticipating any issues as the materials used are strong and durable. Recommended.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works Great 👍🏾;Just got this set of power cords because the last ones are not working like how they used to. I just finished using this with my portable charger at work and it worked great! Charged my phone from 50% to 100% in an hour. With my last cord it used to take like 2 hours to charge.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Nothing lasts forever;These were great. Everything has its limits. Dogs chew, cord gets caught and breaks, get messed up on ends, etc. But they worked great.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Not so great using while plugged in;Seems to work well, but I'm going to order cables that are 90° angles to replace all of the others.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great product;Hard time finding quality cords for our cell phones, but these have been great.
2.0 out of 5 stars;It's NOT fast charging....disappointed.;"It's an ok cord and good for the price since there are 2, but the only reason I bought it was because it claimed to be fast charging. If a cord is ""Fast Charging"",  ""Fast charging"" will appear on the device as it is charging. (my phone in particular) This one doesn't show up. Also, it seems to charge a bit slower than my regular cord. I'll probably keep just to have for an extra, but now I know I just need to buy one from the apple store."
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good deal;Good price  fast shipping
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works just fine;Good length, sturdy connection. Works great so far
4.0 out of 5 stars;So far so good.;Let's be honest...it's a charging cord. You can 1 at $store. But, I like the length and additional support at the ends. Longevity is the key and I haven't had it very long currently.  The cord seems durable and I have high hopes for extended usage.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Sturdy cable;The cable seems to be strong and well-made. I can't speak to the durability of the cable because I've only had them a short time. The cable charges the phone rapidly. I got a medium length cable since the cable that came with my phone was so short that I couldn't lay the phone on the nightstand when it was connected to the charger. Didn't see any drop off time in charging time with the new cable. I would recommend the cable.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great design, length perfect, charging eh;I wish it came with a base that is compatible for the cord. Otherwise depending on the wall base you use it will charge at a pretty average rate.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Works good first;Was working perfect first week by week 2 not charging much . Little to none .
4.0 out of 5 stars;USB Type C - Fast charging;Bought in pink colour for tablets and phones which have Type C USB charging ports.  Cables appeared well-made and the pink tones looked good. All were 10 ft, which is a good overall length. If the full length is not required, you can coil up the unneeded portion. Used one on a car trip to keep tablet charged while playing music and all 4 at destination (for two tablets and 2 phones - all Android.) They worked fine and all fit the charging ports. However, while enroute, the cable did not seek to deliver quite enough power to keep the tablet from slowly losing charge. May have been this one was slightly defective - so I downgraded the charging power. Otherwise, nice size and not too thick or bulky. Good value.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Crapped out;Working fine until it crapped out.  Don't move this cord around.  Has been plugged into a USB port on my PC for charging for a while now.  Started to intermittently charge and and then not charge my phone.  To make sure it wasn't a PC USB port, I tried a couple of other cables and they were fine.  USB C connector appears fine and unharmed.Not buying again.  Way too much out there to choose from.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice cords but began fraying after minimal use;They're ok
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging;The cable works but it's not fast charging
5.0 out of 5 stars;So far exactly what I needed!;"I'm not a power expert by any means. I purchased this to have extra C type cords in my house for charging my Pixel. So far they are charging faster than any other cord I have currently been using, seem durable and the actual part that plugs into the phone is small and slides right into my Pixel with case"" most cords are to think at the end and won't fit through my case""."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Durability;Like d length
4.0 out of 5 stars;They work very well;They work very well
5.0 out of 5 stars;Two years later...;These cords have been wonderful.  Two years later, and they look and work like they're brand new.  They've been shoved unceremoniously in countless bags, been twisted, coiled, bundled, wrapped, kinked, run over with an office chair 20 times a day, and there's not so much as a scratch in the beautiful red plating.  10/10 do recommend!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Durable and fast charging. Very impressed;For the last 5 years ive gone through every charger cable you can imagine for android and iphones. This is literally the best cord ive ever used. Authentic apple cords would break once a month. Belkins both for android and iphone would stop working after a few weeks. I waited a few months to use them before reviewing. I got a 2 pack, 6 ft and i use them at home 24.7 and never leave the house without my charger cords either. They look like i just bought them and im pretty rough. They fast charge on ALMOST any plug in. Ive bought other cables off of amazon too and they would just stop working. Im ordering 2 more today so i can keep these at home and take the shorter ones with me. Must have.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Eventually fails;Works great when it works but it eventually fails. I use it for Android auto in my car and the cable starts to not work correctly after a while. It still charges the phone but it keeps disconnecting Android auto. I would still buy it again, but just keep an extra on hand for when it fails.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great cord to have!!;As a logistics driver:-) the phones we use will loose battery power over 8+ hours shifts and when you realize it’s down, you want power restored quickly  to avoid walking  around with the charger forever.  This cords gives rapid charging
4.0 out of 5 stars;Too stiff;I prefer flexible cables so was disappointed that these are so stiff.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Very durable.;Nice durable cord. Charges my Galaxy phone very quickly. This is the second time I've ordered this exact cord. Lost other cords they didn't wear out.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Worked well for about 6 weeks, then got a little loosey goosey.;I was initially happy with the product. But within weeks you could feel that the connection was getting weaker and would need adjustment to ensure charging.
3.0 out of 5 stars;I bought a pack of two cords.  First one quit working after about three months.;I bought a pack of two cords.  First one quit working after about three months.  I was only using one so now I'm on the second one and we shall see how long this one lasts.
5.0 out of 5 stars;It's very fast charging;It works very well. It charges fast.
5.0 out of 5 stars;As advertised!;Just started using the cord , so can’t comment on the durability, but so far just as advertised!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Love the durability;I use this charger for my deliveries and it’s keeps my delivery phone charged. The durability is great I can bend it and work with it no problem no shortages!!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Mixed batch of cord types! Otherwise decent;Three of the cords I received were USB-C to USB-C not USB-C to USB-A. Therefore I have three cords in this pack that are completely useless to me. Very frustrating when I grabbed a cord from the batch for a business trip, got to my destination, then realized I had no way to charge my phone.In terms of quality these are good cables and I have had no significant issues with them in use. The connection ends do bend easily and will not hold up to abuse use very long. Recommended but check all of your cables upon receipt. Do not wait months to find you have mixed cables like I did.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good for price;Not a bad buy for the price. It works like a normal charger. Rarely heat's up the phone.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Junk;1 cord doesn't work therefore it's no deal.
4.0 out of 5 stars;So far so good;Cord is great so far, but my experience is you have to see how long they last, and I've only had them a short time.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Power n length;I honestly do not feel these cords charge any faster.  I do really enjoy the fact that they do not tangle and they are much longer than our original cords.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not USB 3;When reading the description you could be fooled thinking that these are USB 3, but they are not.  They are 3.1A for charging.  Wish the company would clear that up in its description.  Had to order a real USB C to USB A 3.0 cable, which has blue on the USB side.Cable is probably great for charging, but not for data transfer.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Two years later and mine don't really work;They do charge my phone, but I quickly get a slow charging message. Looking inside, the prongs look slightly different than the one that came with my phone, even though both are USB C chargers.Last phone died due to charging port, with these cables....I am not sure it was due to the cables or not.Just use the cable made for your phone.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Decent value - but don't expect them to last forever;Second set I've owned. I like the braiding on the outside of the cord. I'm pretty abusive with my cables, and the first set lasted about two years. Cheap enough to replace when the connections start failing.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Seems like quality to me;Title sums it up. It's hard to break
4.0 out of 5 stars;Sadly not cat proof;I checked reviews to make sure this would survive my cat and several said it was chew proof.  Sadly, that's not the case. The little butt got through the first one when I forgot to hide the cords one night. Then she got the other when I dozed off after work with my phone charging on my desk. Worked great while it lasted though! But if you have a chewer, just spring for a metal cord.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charging;Slow charge cords.  I plugged them into the same connection as my other cord and right a way my phone told me it was no longer charging at full power
5.0 out of 5 stars;Just what we wanted;No
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works on kindle fire;4/5 stars because these cords won’t charge my daughter laptop but will charge my younger kid’s kindle fire. Weird.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great cord!;It's a cord, not a cable that can get kinked and damage internal wiring
3.0 out of 5 stars;These are not for fast charging.;The headline says it all.
5.0 out of 5 stars;I liked them so much I ordered 2 sets;My old cord was cutting in and out so it was time to replace. I chose this cord based on the number of reviews it had. When I plugged it into my phone I couldn't believe how fast my phone connected to my car. It was instantly. This cord seems to be quite durable and I think it will last a long time since it is braided. I am pretty easy on my cords and don't jerk them in and out. I'm quite pleased with this purchase. Plus I have an extra cord for the future. Highly satisfied!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Average cord ,;It's an average product , that works , but not that fast.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Es demasiado largo ...;Muy buen producto pero no carga rápida.. es demasiado largo... El doble de largó para un cordón ...
4.0 out of 5 stars;Better then $40 cables;These are strong, long, an thick material... does not feel cheap. Only problem is sometimes it makes a humming noise while charging but thts just the current running through and switching the side take it away. Iv had other cables do that as well so no big deal. I do highly recommend these, even better then the $40 ones from bestbuy that I gone through 3 or 4, no issues with this one and you get 2!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Check both cables;I only used one of the cables when they arrived. It was a great length and seemed durable. Yesterday I tried the second cable and it is a little off and will not fit the port on my phone. I'm past the return date so now I'm stuck with a useless cable.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Meet my need for use;To have for vehicle use
5.0 out of 5 stars;Does the Job;Length and Quality
2.0 out of 5 stars;DO NOT BUY THIS FOR EVERYDAY USE;Okay here's the good, the bad, and the ugly of this cord.Upon first inspection it seems very high quality and it feels like it will last, 6 feet is a good length for most things, and it charges my phone fast. That's where the good things end.The good quality is only skin deep, after about 4 months the cable fails (I originally bought 4 of this brand C cable, and 6 micro USB cables. And every one has had the exact same failure) The strain relief is also poor quality, after a month or 2 it broke rendering it useless.I use a USB C cable every day for my phone, I have an outlet right next to my bed and sometimes my dog will catch it and violently rip it from the wall. I use a fancy outlet that has USB ports built in so I get fast charging without paying greedy companies for a fast charger power brick. For occasional use this is an amazing cable, but if you want to use it every day to charge a pair of headphones, phone, tablet etc this cable doesn't live up to expectations.Also while it was plugged into one of my outlets it started smoking horrendously and filled my room with the ungodly stench of an electrical fire, and upon assessing the damage there were no flames (thank god) but the back of the outlet (where the wires attach to it) had blown off.I have no way of knowing whether or not the wiring of the outlet, the outlet itself, or the cable caused the issue but it's something worth keeping an eye on - especially since I saw another review mentioning this cable as a fire hazard.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Usb-A is 2.0 not 3.0;Good charger, very durable, got 1 for my car and 1 for my bedroom. In case anyone is curious, the USB-A port (side that plugs into the wall) is 2.0 not 3.0. Mainly effects data speeds not charging rate. Great charger overall
2.0 out of 5 stars;These are NOT flexible;I purchased these because they were braided cloth.  Wanted a flexible cable.  These are very inflexible, to the point where a 1' to 2' loop going from my dashboard to center console, has to be physically pushed down.  Won't lay flat on its own.  That being said, the cables perform adequately in all other regards.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works great;Got it use it all the time no problem
5.0 out of 5 stars;Very good cords.;Very nice cords.  Great length.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Multiple purchaser;These seemed like a good durable product so I bought two 4' lengths. I liked them so much I bought 4 2'  lengths. I think they are durable
4.0 out of 5 stars;Not for an iPad;I give it four stars as it may work work fine in other applications. However, be advised that it will NOT charge a 5th generation 12.9” iPad Pro. As we aren’t all experts on USB C cables, that should be clearly stated in the description. There was no problem with returning it.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Worth the price;Works fine. After a month it began to disconnect and reconnect several times when plugged in for the first minutes charging. Then it stops disconnecting and keeps charging smoothly.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Fire hazard?;I've had this cord for three months. It worked great. Today it wasn't working and when I checked it, it was starting to burn while connected to phone. Not sure if maybe it wasn't plugged in in the outlet all the way or if somehow cord was damaged, but I'm throwing this cord, the plug, and the other cord of same brand away.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good cables;These cables are great. I like that they come with Velcro straps to hold them together. They charge well and don't seem like they'll break.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charge;Slow charge.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Read this if your cables don't fast charge;"My first impression of these cables was very good. The nylon braid makes them feel very durable, and the leather fastener is a nice touch to keep the cables organized. (It looks much nicer than the bread ties I usually use) When I plugged in my phone (Galaxy S8) I noticed something was off. When I plugged this cable and my phone into the official Samsung charger, I did not get the ""Fast Charging"" message at the bottom of my screen. I tried plugging them into my computer, and my phone did not show up to sync. After some fiddling, I noticed that my phone was able to connect when I held the cable tightly in place. On a whim, I tried sanding down the end of the USB-C end, and that allowed the cable to seat properly into my phone's port. (When doing this, make sure to hold the cable level) This is not something that I should have to do in order to use a cable, but it is a relatively easy fix for a cable that may seem ""broken"""
3.0 out of 5 stars;Way overkill for what I wanted/expected;Pretty well built, but I wanted a couple light, flexible charging cables for various everyday applications. These are actually too robust to close in a car console or similar.
4.0 out of 5 stars;durable;Length of cords are nice
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works as a cable should!;Feels durable.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Value;Works as advertised
5.0 out of 5 stars;only cord on Amazon that charges my LG V60;I bought a used LG V60, and was having horrendous problems getting it to charge, I thought it was my chargers (or maybe a bad phone/battery) , but everything else charged just fine.  The V60 would indicate it was charging, but when I woke up the next morning, it barely moved a percentage point on the battery indicator.  I narrowed it down to the different cords, and this was the only brand that reliably charged the V60.  I don't know why, but I immediately bought a bunch more in different lengths and they all worked just finePhysically, all the cords were same braided cable, but these just worked
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works well;Does a good job.This is the second time we bought this particular one.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Only One in the Pair Worked;First one out the box didn’t even register for charging or connection. Second one worked as advertised. But I payed for two :/
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good value;Reasonable price
5.0 out of 5 stars;easy to use;works great
5.0 out of 5 stars;The color red makes it easy to determine which cord I need;Haven't had it long enough to have any dislikes
3.0 out of 5 stars;Ordered to long and durability is not great;Durability not great a d I ordered to long (my fault) I will try a different company in the future as these have about worn out on the plug-in part and can fall out of the phone now. They look great, but we f they fall out and you wake to no charge... That's a problem.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Both failed in less than 3 years.;My wife and I each used one cable, each with our own charging habits and different phone brands.  Both cables failed to reliably charge after slightly under 3 years.  Oddly, each of our phones would recognize it was plugged in and would say it was charging, but it was either very slow or not at all.  There was no physical damage out looseness in either cable.  It's too bad in this disposable economy 3 years will probably be seen as acceptable. Side note: the braided cable can be a little stiff and does not coil as easily as traditional cables.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Charges great, but will not transfer pictures from phone to computer;Changes great but will not transfer pictures from phone to computer
2.0 out of 5 stars;Broke after a few months.;For something that promised durability, I sure did not get it.I kept this plugged into my power strip right by my bed so it never traveled or anything. Tonight, I go to plug in and there's resistance--it does not want to connect.After removing cable from the charging port, I noticed a small black plastic and metal piece lodged in the well where the connector pins are.I removed careful and now the cable does not charge and triggers possible liquid damage error.Do not buy these.
3.0 out of 5 stars;The cables don't last long;At first these cables work great came in a 3 pack. However I use one in my car daily to connect to my console. Didnt last long before the wire came loose and not longer connects correctly.  This has happened before and this time I thought buyers should be aware
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not what they say;I bought this because it's supposed to be a fast charger. Sometimes it is sometimes my phone says it isn't.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Phone Charger;Item was as described, very good quality.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Won't stay in the charging port;You heard it here first
5.0 out of 5 stars;Excellent Value and Performance;I am highly satisfied so far!! These cords charge just as well as the 6ft cord I bought through Verizon for $25 and I only received 1 6ft cord from Verizon. I have also used these cords to charge my gaming controllers (PS5 & XBOX X) and I am highly satisfied.. These have been a bargain so far, let's see how long they hold up!!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good cable;So far works as advertised . I will be purchasing more in the future and would recommend.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Loose connection;Charger works great when it stays connected. Port is not the best fit into the phone. Comes unplugged/disconnected too easily. Cord length is great. Gives flexibility when using your phone while charging. Just wish the fit was better.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Sturdy and dependable!;Great product, fast charge, at a great price for two. They each come with a velcro tab that lets me shorten the 6ft length at home or keep it long when out or in my car. A+.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Neither cord is fast charging;Each cord reads that it will take 1 hour and 13 minutes to charge my phone from 60% to 100%. I'll be returning them. If you're ok with slow charging cables, they do seem sturdy, the length is fine, and I personally liked the red color to help distinguish these cables from the various others we use.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Long;It does fast charge but a week after it kept connecting then disconnecting on its own. I checked the wall connection and the direct phone connection and it kept doing it. I wasnt sure what was happening. I havent used it since then about a week ago. Thats just one of the cords. The other one i use for my car and it works fine.
5.0 out of 5 stars;BEST CORD EVER!!! ❤️;Only cords I will ever buy! My last one lasted over a year! Would've lasted much longer, but I took a trip to FL, and my friend's cat must've gotten to it 🤣
5.0 out of 5 stars;very good quality.  Ment to last;I have never been disappoint with their produvts made very well, ment to last. The extra lenght comes in handy in th car to reach the back seat.  Would buy again and have done so.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Super fast charging.;Nice long cord, heavy duty cable.
5.0 out of 5 stars;They were fine;They worked great untill they started with a small short in February so they made it about a year under normal use before they started cutting out when charging my phone
5.0 out of 5 stars;Charging cord;This cord was purchased to plug in a computer keyboard. Works perfectly and arrived on time.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Durable;Love the built in Velcro to wrap cord up
3.0 out of 5 stars;Very stiff but looks great;The review requests comment about length ,durability and charging power.  I expect the length to be correct and charging capability to be sufficient. Durability will be determined much later. The cords seem to be robust but are far too stiff for me
3.0 out of 5 stars;Just a cable;It’s just an average cable
3.0 out of 5 stars;Does not work with Android Auto;I bought this specifically to connect my Samsung Galaxy S9+ cellphone to my car via Android Auto and these cables do not work for that. I have used other brands of cables and the original charging cable and they work fine, but I get a pop up notice on my phone when I tried using these brand new cables!!! Dont buy if you need to use them for Android Auto or Apple Car Play - they simply don't work for that connection.  Otherwise,  they charge my cellphone quickly, so it wasn't a total waste of money.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good value;Good value
5.0 out of 5 stars;Best Cords I have found!;These are the best cords!  We use them all over our home, in our vehicles and have purchased them for our family as well.  They are very durable and have lasted very well.  We use the 3' and 6' cords and they are AWESOME!
3.0 out of 5 stars;One did not work;"One cable kept losing contact. The other cable worked fine and I continue to use it daily with no problems. I only needed one cable so I am ""mostly"" satisfied."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Durable;Is most durable cable I've had
4.0 out of 5 stars;Quality product;This product allowed me to charge my equipment in the truck
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect length;Exactly what I needed.  Cord has a durable rubber between the cable and the USB cage.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Use these all the time;Have multiple sets of these for multiple items and swear by them.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good product for the price!;Love the 6ft. length!
2.0 out of 5 stars;So disappointed!;This is the 2nd time I've purchased this item.  First 2 lasted over 2 years.  This latest purchase, 1 cable worked for only 3 weeks and today I'm using the other one.  So far, I'm out of 1/2 my money because I can't return just one.  I will update this review if the other one conks out.  I am so disappointed!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Quality seems high.  It works!;I am using this to charge a high-intensity portable light and seems to have done the job.  Haven't had the opportunity to use it for a while so I cannot comment on its durability.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great Buy!!;Very nice cable!! Heavy and durable, seems like it will last a while!!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Connection issues Note 10+;Works well when connected, but will randomly lose connection and reconnect without being touched or moved. Happens with both cables I received. I have to face my phone down and mute it to avoid annoying notifications and my screen lighting up each time it changes in the middle of the night. The cables function but at the cost of my sanity.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Fast charging cable.;Work great with the 3A charging block.Use to charge Samsung Galaxy phone
5.0 out of 5 stars;Nice;Very well made!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Just the cord;I didn't realize it was literally going to be JUST the cord and not the wall adapter part. Huge bummer. So I have to buy those separately? So annoying.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Enjoying a sturdy USB cable end;I’ve just discovered that my iPad charger also charges the kids phones. Huge, huge problem. Because they’ll be swiping my charger, and I’ll be mad, blah blah blah. Ordered four of these in self defense. I like that the ends don’t look like they’ll bend and break like the apple cords. So far so good!!!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Happy;Happy
2.0 out of 5 stars;Is it me or is it the cord?;I bought a set of these a while back. I went to unplug one of them and end of the cord separated. I thought it was me. I gave it the benefit of the doubt. I bought another set. It did the same thing. Not sturdy at all....They are going back.
4.0 out of 5 stars;so far so good;this charging cable seems sturdier than others I've had. I like the length. The outlet is behind our couch and this length is just right.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Looks great, but super-stiff cable;The cables are attractive, work fine, and are a good value for the money. However, the listing makes it look like they are flexible like any other USB cable. They are not - see the photo. It's not worth sending it back, but if I had known this, I would have kept looking for other options.
3.0 out of 5 stars;It's functional;It's a more than decent cable. Really durable. But it does not charge my Galaxy Note10 as quickly as the standard cable did. It actually takes much longer. Where it would take about  and hour to fully charge from 20%, it now takes more than 3 hours. But it's functional for the most part.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not a fast charger;I purchased the 10 ft charger which is nice amd long enough for what i need it for but it's not a fast charger. It's about 30 minutes slower than a fast charger I already had. I do like the length so I may keep it despite the fact it's not a fast charger as advertised
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good strain reliefs on cable ends;Good strain reliefs on cable ends.  The attached cable tie is a good touch: some kind of tie is necessary to keep long cords from getting twisted.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great charger at great price;I have bought these several times to put where ever I need to charge phones etc.  Works great every time.
5.0 out of 5 stars;They work great;I use the cords to charge my phone and tablet
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging, according to my Samsung.  Of the two. Only one is working now.;Not fast charging.  Too slow for the price.  One of two already not working.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Quick charge didn't last, loose fit after a few months.;I like the long, fabric cord, however the quick charge turns on/off with movement of cord connection.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Excellent So Far;Very pleased with this product so far.  Just started using the cable.  Time will tell.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Length was important;The length
3.0 out of 5 stars;Too soon to review;Try again in December
4.0 out of 5 stars;PRETTY good;I WAS VERY HAPPY
4.0 out of 5 stars;Strong cable;Strong sturdy cable, good connection. Not very flexible though.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great product;This cord fits like a condom! It is well worth the price I paid
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great product, very durable.  Looks good too!;The product is very durable and looks great too.  I purchased one with 12v charger a couple of years ago and still working great.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Excellent build quality for the money very nice upgrade from the factory delivered cord;The build quality of these chords is much higher than I expected for the low cost if I go to my mobile store and get a replacement cable for my phone of the same quality that came with it in the package which is much lower it would cost about $5 each so for the same amount of money I got a significant upgrade and I like the cord length and the little strap of velcro for spooling up your cord to keep it out of your way or store it I will definitely purchase some more of these for other devices I keep a few on hand in case they get animal chewed or lost.
4.0 out of 5 stars;So far,So good.;I've only had it for a couple of days, but so far I'm happy with it. It seems like it is very well built and will last. The length is as advertised. I haven't used it with the phones charger,but just as a USB and it works fine.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Damaged, unseed packaging;The large envelope, as well as 1 other item that I had ordered in addition to this one, arrived unharmed. However, this items packaging (as seen in the pictures) arrived damaged. It was dented, ripped, and there were no seals anywhere. The wires themselves don't seem to be damaged, and work fine after a quick test. But because of the damaged state that it arrived in, it seems that it was previously used, or at least the packaging was opened for some reason.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not the best;These chargers didn't last a month
5.0 out of 5 stars;Well made, good design and reasonable price.;I like the choice of colors and length of cords and the times for charging batteries.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Puppy tough!;I dont usually write reviews honestly but after 6 months of using these I had to come back and say holy crap! We go through charging cords like crazy around here, a lot of the cheap ones from Amazon just break on their own after a few weeks. But the thing that's impressed me the most about these specific cords is they have survived so many puppy attacks! We foster puppies so there's constantly a new puppy finding one of these that got left within their reach somehow and these cords still work perfectly fine! Definitely gonna buy more when we need to.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good quality & nice green color;order arrived quickly & fit my new Galaxy Note 10 Plus. I ordered this cord for the car so I could charge or use for android car play. I also ordered the cords so I could use my old wall chargers. Seem to be good quality so far. I would have liked the option of a short cord for the car & a longer cord for the house.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Solid;Only had them for a few weeks, but I have already gone back to order more to replace the rest of my cords.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not bad but not great;One of the two cords didn't fit firmly enough in the charger USB port,so it couldn't charge anything.  The second cord would charge my cellphone which has a USB C charging port, but it was kind of slow. Still it is working all right to charge overnight.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great cables;These are well made and work great
3.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charger;It's a slow charge compared to the charger that came with my phone but it is fast compared to other gas station or Amazon purchased chargers.I still use it for when I don't need to use my phone while simultaneously charging it.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works great;Works great
4.0 out of 5 stars;Had them for about a month.;So far seem fairly durable, and are fast charging. Going to order more for my kids.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Charge it;Geys the fast charging really going
2.0 out of 5 stars;Great long charging usb-c cable with an issue;Upon arrival, the cable worked great!  It was nice and long to make it easy to charge almost anywhere, and not have to be tightly tethered to a wall outlet that is close to a table or something.  After while, something happened.  I plug my phone in at night with, let's say, 20% battery life.  I wake up 6 or 7 hours late, and my phone is at 23% battery life.  WTF?  Come to find out, the charging cable sort of pushes itself away from the phone slightly (just a hair, to the point where the charging connection isn't being made), and the phone looks like it is charging, but it is not.I thought the  phone case was the issue, so I used a dremel and cut out the case a little bit around the charging port to maybe make room for a slightly bigger cable plug.  Well that did not work.  Problem still happens.  I use this cable at my desk at work, and I use the original charger in my truck, which I have no problems with at all.  The OEM charger charges my phone a lot faster and a lot more reliable, I don't have to worry about this little issue.I have even taken my phone case off, and charged the phone with this cable that way.  It didn't matter, still wanted to do it's little push-off, so I am sort of at a loss for words, because I have no idea what is causing this.  I have to rate this cable 2 stars because the issue is a big deal.  If the phone charging isn't reliable and I have no idea where my battery life is going to be when I wake up, then what's the point of using the cable?I am now looking for a second OEM charger.Not sure what changed, but hopefully JSAUX can help me figure it out!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Product as described/promised...always order this brand for all my devices!;Product as described/promised...always order this brand for all my devices!
5.0 out of 5 stars;As described;No problem. Works as described.
4.0 out of 5 stars;The second one was damaged;One of them was damaged
3.0 out of 5 stars;2 for 1;One did not seem to work, the other was perfect.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great cables.;Great cables that seem to go bad over time. I buy these every year or two and multiple go bad around the same time. Slow charging no matter what adapter I'm using. Switch to a new cord and it works fine. For the price I can definitely justify swapping them out.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Veru durable;I love these cables.  Should have got the 3ft. ones, but that was my fault.  We have two in the car so that my husband and I charge our phones as we drive.  One on my laptop as I am checking my emails and playing.  Yes, I have ordered these before so I have more than two.  Very bendable and durable.  Love them.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Cord length;I loved this product at first than one day it wouldn't charge my phone anymore, so I dont know if I just got a bad one.
3.0 out of 5 stars;These cords are fast, for awhile.;Update:  after 3 months, these cords are not consistently charging the phone.  Instead of under 2 hours, it now estimates up to 30 hours to charge once its connected to the phone, and the phone can even continue to lose charge even after its connected, which never happened 3 months ago.  At times you can jiggle where its connected and get a faster connection, but it may oray not last.  No signs of wear or twisting to look at the cords.First week: Love how sturdy these cords feel. Great length and have velcro attached in the middle to wind them up when they are too long.  They charge my phone very quickly.  It's just been a few weeks, but they aren't bending at the connection part.  Highly recommend.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good replacement for a special cord.;Samsung phones have a different charger cord than any other USB cable. These were a great replacement for the original cord which got broken. Looks like it will last for a long while, and I got 2 of them, just in case. Very reasonably priced.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works beautifully;This cord works very well. I love the long length. It seems to be very strong.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Quality cords;I have now owned these cords for 2 years and it is used daily. My phone charges up so quick! Usually cords get replaced often, but this one is still going strong. It's durable, the 6 foot is a great length for having it charge and still be able to use your phone. Just bought a back up second set today.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Durable and compatible;I have only used the product for about three weeks.  So far, it has served its purpose.  My phone charges just as fast as it did with the original new fast-charger.  Cord is completely adaptable.  It has a sturdy feel to it.  Looks like good construction.  Not easy to get a kink in it.  I'm still not sure if I like the length.  Its great for inside the home, but a bit too long for the car.  Its quite a bit of cord to condense.  Very satisfied, so far.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works fine so far;Works fine for now
5.0 out of 5 stars;Just what I needed.;These cables feel well made and very solid at the connectors.  They are a little stiff but I don't need to put much bend in them.  The connectors fit very securely with no wiggle at all.  Charging time is on pare with the short OEM cable.  I must note that I am charging a Fenix flashlight battery NOT a cell phone.  Would buy again if I need more.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Unhappy;I won’t use these ever again cause it does last the charge it’s sad it lasts maybe a day but with the one it comes with it lasts much longer for days
5.0 out of 5 stars;Yeah... Kids and chargers... Need a ton of them.;Kids still learning to be gentle with the chargers. These have lasted longer than some. Decent price, just wish I didn't have to buy so many.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Not the Best for Nintendo Switch;My first impression is that the cord is very well made and durable. I have no complaints about the quality of the product. However, I need to do more testing. Initially, I plugged this cord into my iPhone charger block and tried to charge my Nintendo Switch. If I’m not using the Switch, it charges just fine. If I’m trying to charge it while using it, however, it does not provide enough charge to do both. Maybe a stronger charger block would help, but overall, I’m impressed with the construction and will continue to use the product!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Awesome USB Cables;High quality cables at a very reasonable price! Highly recommend.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Amazon is impossible to contact;Im trying to verify my info on Amazon verifications page, but every time i upload my DL or bank account photos it gets nowhere and i cant contact amazon to resolve. maybe this will work
4.0 out of 5 stars;Decent - a bit stiff;These are good. charge well. DurableThey are a bit stiff. Most other cables are far more flexible for the same durability.I buy them on occasion for the value - but not where flexibility in usage or stability is a factor.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging.;It's not fast cgarger.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Very worth it.  I will buy more, I'm sure.;You get 2 for 10 bucks.  Quality is good.  Long.  I haven't had one break yet due to wearing or tearing.  I've ordered 3 times, and only one has broke due to me running over it with my desk chair at work.  The problems I had with older non USB C Jack's, where it's like it still plugs in fine but doesnt connect to the phone has yet to happen with these and I'm months into the purchase.  Why 4 stars?  Because they charge 1 dollar more for the blue and 2 dollars more for the grey versus the red being 9.99.  Is the dye more expensive?  Either way, I still bought 1 set of each and I like them all.  But I'm a very monochrome person, and like dark colors, so I go with grey and blue.  And regardless, this is a great deal.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Too stiff;Great item but it’s really stiff and awkward with the length that I purchased
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good value;The tip ends up coming loose or not fitting at the right angle and won't charge after a while. But most of the cables I've bought, I'm able to get several months use before they break. These definitely last longer than other cables I've bought.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Didn't fit Samsung mobile phone...;"I bought these cables as extra cables to put in my checked and carry-on airline bags.  They are a good, workable length and appear well-made.  They do NOT fit a Samsung mobile phone.  The small end, normally plugged into the phone for charging, is too wide.  Rather than bother with sending them back I just threw them in my growing box of ""Misc. Cables"" in the faint hope that they might fit another electronic device I have now or acquire in the future.  Rather disappointed with purchase."
4.0 out of 5 stars;As Expected;I gave an overall review of 4 stars since the product was just received and I have no idea how long it will last. It charges quickly and the length is more than I needed. If the cable last longer than the last one ( different brand) I will buy again.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Buy now, no regrets later;Edited:It is now November of 2022 and the cable is still going strong!!!It's been almost 2 years since I have bought these charging cables and I have not had to use the second charging cord.  That says a lot.  Normally, with other brands, after about 6 months or so, I have to break into the second charging cord because something inevitably happens with the durability or power of the first cord.  These are the best charging cables I have ever used.  You can't beat the price and the lasting power.  Charges my Pixel 3 perfectly!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good quality!;Only small issue is they are quite stiff . Else just fine.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Happy with this delivery;Worked like a charm... Thanks
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good cords;Very durable cords for charging devices.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Worked Really Well for a Couple Years;Worked really well for a couple years but now I'm not sure if it's the cable or my phone that is having charging issues. The cable has to be at the perfect angle to charge my phone and I don't have that issue on any OE cables from my previous google pixel phones.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Great Unless You Don't Need Support;One of the two products I purchased was defective - 4 months past the date to return it.  No support options on the store page, and Amazon has no way to contact them.  Really like the one that works, but disappointed at the inability to get support.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great Value;High speed charging, durable and great price highly recommended
2.0 out of 5 stars;One works.;I've bought these before and needed to replace a worn cord. I used one of the cords in the new pack and it does what I expect.  It charges my phone.I have tried the other cable with 2 different wall adapters and a power bank. I keep getting an alert that there is moisture in my port on the random occasions I get my phone to recognize it. There's no water. It seems to be a dud.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good;They work well so far!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not a Fast Charging Cable;Does not charge fast but it does the job.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Braided cord nice but picks up dirt.;Braided cord is nice just keep it away from dirt.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charge;Didn't notice it was USB type c charger didn't think it would matter. But this charger didn't charge my phone fast like it's supposed to. I recommend you get the type c to c instead of USB.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Very durable charging cables.;The cables are a very nice 6' length, and very sturdy cables.  They have a rubber tip over the connector which flexes with the cable, and keeps the connector from bending.  Also on each cable is an attached Velcro strap if you want to shorten the cable.  Overall so far, no issues.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Received item fast, but disappointed in performance;Very durable and love the length.  Highly disagree on the fast charging.  I have a 6 month old phone. Using this cord is taking 2 hours for a full charge.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good durability for the 3 year old!;It isn’t lightening fast but it works well enough.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Will not charge while using device.;Love the length and it charges fine if device is turned off, but it won’t even maintain battery level if device is being used.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Power Up;Great cable.  Feels like it is well made with no fraying or loose ends.  Works well from either a wall socket, computer USB, or mini charger.  If I have anything to be picky about it is this.  I wish they would offer a slightly shorter version of this cable.  It is nice to have a long one but a shorty would be the icing on the cake!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Pretty color;The color is nice. It works, but is not a fast charging cord. The cord length is nice tho!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Exactly as they look;Product works perfectly
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great cord at a reasonable price;I've been using the cord for about a week now. It charges well and seems to be ruggedly built. The length is plenty long enough for my use. I like the Velcro cord tie wrap that keeps the cord wound up when not in use.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good value. Works well with Galaxy Note 9;These work for charging and for uploading photos from the phone to a computer. Attached Velcro strap was a nice bonus.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Ps5 & OnePlus 9;Charger doesn’t work for ps5 controllers or the OnePlus 9.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Durable and vibrant cables;I like the durability and the vibrancy of these cables. I chose red so it would be easy to find my phone charger amongst all of our other cables. This is nice and long so I don't have to be right next to the outlet. I've only had this for a month or two so I will update later if it doesn't last for long.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Didn't work for my S8;I purchased two sets of these cables to replace the old USB-A cables I had. All I can say is that they didn't work on my S8 I know there are many reviews some that work some that didn't. I purchased the Anker cables and those appear to work just fine, although I did receive a update to my phone after I sent the JSAUX cables back. Not sure if that makes a difference or not. The cables did charge, but slow charging and I didn't want to take the risk of it damaging my phone so I just sent them back. Like I said they didn't work for me not saying they don't work at all. I also tried different plugs, outlets, car chargers with the JSAUX still the same slow charging.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good Quality USB Charger Cable;I have ordered this particular cable twice now. Its quality is better than most USB cables to be used with charging modules (or as a general purpose USB cable). Very sturdy and not suseptable to cable breaking at the cable/connector connection.  Not a bad price either.
3.0 out of 5 stars;One of two bundled cables failed within 12 months;These appear high quality, however, one of the cables failed after less than 12 months with no visible damage/fraying.UPDATE: contacting JSAUX about the cable failure resulted in them sending a brand new set within warranty. Given the warranty support, I'll likely continue to buy their products and chalk the failure up to a QC defect.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Built tough but the fast charge seems to diminish in speed as I continue to use.;Like the length and the build quality.  It does fast charge and quite well put of the box. I've had this charging cable for about a month now and I'm starting to notice the charge time isn't as quick as it was when the cable was brand new. Regardless it's a solid charging cable for the price especially since it comes with 2.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works as expected.;Really well constructed and may be a little too well constructed as the cables are very stiff.  I expect them to hold up great and they are way more visible than black cables.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Best chargers;Glad I went with these chargers. Charge fast and are super durable. I recommend these.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Fabulously good charging cable USB-C;I like the fact that the cables are wrapped. Very strong. And with the fast charging plug my phone charges in less than 2 hours. Great!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Worth the price;So I have to say these are a life saver since I really hate having to take my actual charger from home and not forgetting to bring it back home after i get off work, now I don't have worry about having only one charger or leaving at work and not being able to charge my mobile phone, the cable is a bit longer than expected but that is fine it comes in a pack of two I choose the red color cable since my portable battery charger is red might as well get the cable in red.. These are a must if you have a portable battery charger and don't want to always have to remember to take your charger from home.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Great cable, but only lasted 7 months…;Great cable, but only lasted 7 months…I purchased this teal color, along with two more. The other two are still good, for the time being, this one does not work anymore, after very gentle use (plugged in by nightstand). Buying again, we’ll give it another try.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great;Very good product charges my phone very well. Cable  Is made with a good Braden material  There's two bad things about it:1. It fits loosely in my phone(my other chargers were not like this.2. In the pic I attached you can see it's not a normal port? Idk if I just didnt read the title right but I can only plug it in a specific socket. WeirdOverall 4.7/5
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great but don't bend;Great charging cabe. Right angle connector heps but doesn't prevent bending issues
5.0 out of 5 stars;So far so good;I only recently received this item. I am satisfied with it. It does what it is expected to do.
3.0 out of 5 stars;First there was only one cord and it looked like a rats nest.  It was ot wound up.;Didn't get both cords an it wasn't wound.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not so fast;Seems to be sturdy built but doesn't charge my galaxy a10e any faster than any other charger I have used
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great product;So far, everything has been as described.
5.0 out of 5 stars;5 stars all the way;If you need a type C this is it
3.0 out of 5 stars;Long on cord, slow on charging;Slow charging, long cord which is helpful and durable, just charges too slow.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Does NOT fast charge my Google pixel 4...;I've swapped around chargers and cables and these cables do not work for quick charging with a fast charging adapter I have. All the other cables work with my fast charging adapter these do not...
5.0 out of 5 stars;It's so long I love it 😏😜;It's too long sometimes 😉😜
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great cables;Cables work great
4.0 out of 5 stars;Fast charger works quick delivery. Make sure it's two in package;Works great and will purchase again but I received one cord. Does work and fast charged on 1st try but I returned die to one in package. Will purchase again if refunded.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Finally!!!;Finally, I have found a well made USB cable. Every USB cable I have ever had breaks where the wire attaches to the connector. How hard is it to make a sturdier connection?  Obviously not hard because the company that made this cable did it right. So if you are looking for a good sturdy USB cable look no further. Get this one.Update: I purchased these in May 2018. Of the three two are still going strong but the third one has let me down. The flexible piece that reinforced the section that is attached to the plug has broken and the cable has quit working. They are for the most part still better than the the original cable that came with the phone so I still recommend these. Just be gentle.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Very nice and durable!;Cell and tablet!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Does the job.;This is the second set I've purchased.  They are well made and work as promised.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good and Reasonably Priced;This product is exactly as decribed and works just as written. However the reason for my lower rating was the cord fabric does not seem as durable and has already started to fray/pill like a lower quality fabric. I'm not sure how long these will hold up, but they work great for now.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Lower quality then previous purchases;We loved these cable. This was our 3rd purchase. Unfortunately they aren't holding up like the first 4 cables we received. Shame.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Falsely advertised but still a decent product;Overall I give this product 3 and a half star rating it's durable well put together the length on it is quite nice also a great price considering you got two of them  plus the shipping was quick however I am pretty upset because the product is technically falsely advertised it says the cable is a fast charging cable which to me and what I was looking for was for the cable itself to be the fast-charging item itself and I know these exist because I have one for another mobile device however that's not the case the cables only fast charging if the charging port device that the cable plugs into is a fast charger itself so to me this was unfair and I got a regular cable when I should have got a fast charging cable there's anything this company could do for me to fix what I feel is a mistake and wrong please reach out to me and let me know otherwise this was a great product just re advertise properly and specify that the cable itself is not the item that will fast charge the device thanks
4.0 out of 5 stars;Does It's job right;Not Rating 5 Stars because I'm saving 5 stars for a product that goes above and beyond my expectations. This product is simple it's a USB Type c Charger. My old one was for the Galaxy S9+ and it bent like crazy, For only $16 I recieved 2 of these cables which are long asf and it literally is super durable. The cable is braided and has some sort of guard so the cable won't bend. I charge my phone hanging from the edge of the table and all my chargers have broken cuz of that so hopefully  this doesn't happen to me with these guards on. Honestly would recommend these cables for your phones and other usb c products it has fast charging and is great quality would 100% reccomend.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice and long;Great length and durability. I had it for my Galaxy S8 and it charged well, however, doesn't super charge the newer galaxies for me. The charger also stopped working after about a year and a half, but was worth it while it lasted.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works for my son's new Samsung phone without issues;Bought these for my son and he says they work perfectly with his new Samsung phone.
4.0 out of 5 stars;It charges my phone lol...;I bought this becuz it said fast charger, but it has never charged fast. But, it charges my phone, it's long and it's durable.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good product;Good product
4.0 out of 5 stars;Working out great;Long and sturdy
3.0 out of 5 stars;I ordered too long;The cables are fine.  Do to an error I received 2 meter cables instead the desired 1 meter length.  Amazon compensated me and I re-ordered new cables.  The permit charging and data transmission fine.  But they are bit too stiff for my application.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Durability;You can see for yourself how flexible the cable is. There is an exceptional length of added durability to each end for added strength to prevent breakdown of the wiring and keeps my devices charged and ready to use. Perfect for my Kindle as I read all the time and have had issues with other brands not lasting longer than  a month before replacing.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not shocking;Thos cord is ok.  It charges my phone fine, however there is a right-side-up.  The difference is a charging time that is atleast twice as long if it is upside down.  ALSO it doesnt charge my Macbook no matter which way you plug it in.  I have tried using multiple bricks and using an outlet with built in USB ports. It just wont power the Mackbook.  <sidenote> this review gives stars for cord length, which is subjective.  If i wanted a 3' cord, ordered a 3' cord and recieved a 3' cord, why would i rate that with stars.  If 3' ended up being too short, then thats on me. I just send it back, not give a poor rating for my mistake.  What i think is happening is that they are hoping that you just automatically give it a 5 star for cord length thus boosting the overall product score.
2.0 out of 5 stars;They don't last long.....;I don't think any of these kinds of cables ever last very long.  It's like there's a 'short' in the works.... I'm having to purchase again and it won't be these cables but I'm not confident any of the others are any better.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Started off great...;When I first got this cable, I was so impressed and happy at how lightning quick it charged my phone. It felt sturdy, and reliable. One of the two stopped charging as fast rather quickly, but the price for two and the fact that I still had the second, didn't make me think much of it. Now this one is charging slowly and the window for return is closed. I had high hopes for this product, but my search continues for a fast dependable charging cable. I really did like it, and while they were in working condition, it did what it said.. charge lighting quick.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Will not fast charge Galaxy Note 10 but works with Android Auto;Otherwise works well. Most importantly works well with Android auto
4.0 out of 5 stars;Not a fast charger on S9;Good solid cable. Great length and easy to locate due to red color. I bought it to replace the original cable that came with my Samsung S9 smart phone. My original cable was really  fast charging.  This cable does not charge as fast. It took me several hours to charge my phone.  Just be aware If fast charging is important.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Amazing;These cables are amazing. I have purchased these for everyone I know.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Definitely not fast charge  - save your money;Not sure how long these will last but theyre sleek and bright red. I bought them as theyre suppose to be fast charge but definitely are not and will not repurchase due to this. Would not recommend if looking for a fast charge cord - save your money. Takes over an hour longer to charge my phone to full than my other fast charger
5.0 out of 5 stars;Luv this charger;Luv these chargers.  Great having 2 for convenience.  The flexible protector at phone plug in is great to keep wires from breaking.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good replacement charger;This is a good replacement charger. It works great for my husband's phone overall. However when myself or my son use it sometimes it stops charging as if there is a short in the cord. It acts as a fast charger when paired with the Samsung block.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Quality Charging Cable;This is a good quality charging cable, and I highly recommend it.
3.0 out of 5 stars;They fall out of my cellphone inmediatly!;You have to be vigilant because thebpop out as soon as I connect them to the cellphone. Samsung Galaxy S8.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good for daily use.;Product is great. Love the long length of the cord. Use 1 in my work bag with my battery backups and the other my wife uses at home. Only issue is doesnt charge as fast as it says. But all in all id recommend these.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works great so far;Bought these for a Samsung S20.  Right our of the package they felt durable.  They also came with a neat little cord strap in case you wanted to shorten the length. My concern with buying a non Samsung charger was if it would fast charge.  These fast charge as long as you have the right charging cube.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Didn't Even last 5 Months;Initially it was a very good cable and it seems well built. This is my daily primary cable to charge my phone at night and it's been great... until now.Unfortunately the cable has been finicky lately and won't charge my phone anymore unless I finesse it just right. The moment I brush the cable, it stops charging and I have to angle the cable to make it work again.I have only owned this cable in less than 5 months and it's already going bad.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Can't Ask For Anything More!;Hands down the best cable I have ever purchased! It's sturdy AF, comes with an attached strap so you can always keep it nice a neat(especially when not using all 6 ft), has awesome colors to choose from, and is the fastest cable I've ever used. And all that for around $5! I regret having wasted so much money on garbage cables my entire life... Never again!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Decent charger;Good charger as long as you are not using your phone at the same time, definitely not a super fast charger but gets the job done.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Not consistent but not horrible;The cord itself is fine, but the connector is not secure in my phone. My case is not super bulky but it seems to interfere. The second cord in this set works well, so it may just be slightly inconsistent. I just expect a new cord to not have as much trouble staying plugged in correctly.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great charger;I wasn't sure about how durable it was going to be but I'm surprised its pretty sturdy looking feels really thick and strong last time I bought a charger online it was very flimsy let's hope this one lasts awhile
5.0 out of 5 stars;Reliable and long lasting.;This is the 3rd set of cables I have ordered. Still have all the original sets. Bought these for my inlaws cause they were looking for some longer reliable cables. These cables last even with a little one running around unplugging them and playing with them all the time.
3.0 out of 5 stars;works;works
4.0 out of 5 stars;Won't charge after almost a year;First, I've had this charger for under a year. Before that and before I'd gotten my Samsung Galaxy S8, I'd gotten the regular (non-USB C) charging cable from this company. I absolutely loved the charging capabilities... While they lasted.  Now, my phone won't charge with this cable, only if the phone is off. I'm not sure what happened, but it started out great. Four star rating because of this and the fact that I am majorly bummed.
4.0 out of 5 stars;solid cable, a little too stiff;Nice cable, well-made cable. The dimensions of the plugs seems perfect (which is sometimes an issue with cheaper cables) and high-speed charging works correctly as well.The one thing I'd change is to make it more flexible. Braided cables don't have to be stiff, but this cable is so stiff that it will move the position of my phone after I lay it down if there is much bend in the cable. Perhaps it will become more flexible with time. I've had to be careful that my phone won't fall when resting the phone on a shelf with the cable hanging down to the outlet where it is plugged in.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Charger lasted one year.;Bought a set a year ago and the cord was already messing up to where my phone was saying 7 hours until full charge. Had to replace with a new one.
4.0 out of 5 stars;love it;very highly reccomended
5.0 out of 5 stars;High quality cable;So I'm not gonna hit you with ohms or data transfer speeds..... I'm gonna hit you with durability. This is a very durable feeling cord and the rubber on the ends has definitely been doing its job of keeping the cable from breaking internally or the insulation from cracking at the plug. I tend to be rough on my cables at times and these are holding up wonderfully. I'm actually still on my first cable and the other is just sitting idle on my dresser waiting for me. Charge times seem to be as good as the factory Samsung cables, so really, what more could you ask for? Oh, color is great too! Really nice red.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Not used often, but no issues.;I don’t use these often, just for charging a pair of Bluetooth wireless headphones via the case, but i have had no issues whatsoever. I have the other one to my sister and she has had no issues either using it to charge her USB-C phone.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Worked pretty well except had to pull hard to remove from phone on some of connectors.;Worked pretty well except had to pull hard to release from phone on some connectors.
4.0 out of 5 stars;USB-C CONNECTOR it a bit thick;While these do work on Samsung galaxy with fast charging the USB C connector is a just a tiny bit too thick to fit through me phones protective case. The will work on my wife's phone. We have one fail but I can't rule out physical damage as my daughter is notoriously rough on electronic items. The rest of them are fine
4.0 out of 5 stars;Very good 👍;I like it
1.0 out of 5 stars;Dead after warranty expires.;After 3 years of infrequent use, my phone does not charge and shows an error message with one of these cables. The other one died a year earlier Not buying this brand again or any other brand with short warranties because, obviously, the products are only good during the warranty period.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Very sturdy and fast charging cable.;This 3.0 USB C charging Cable is the perfect length for my nightstand and is very durable. The cable charges very quickly utilizing a Qualcomm 3.0 charging block charging a Samsung Galaxy s20 in just 1hr from 0% to 100% and my battery is a 5000mah. This is the second time I've ordered this cable but the past one is a micro USB. Definitely worth the money.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Quality;The price
5.0 out of 5 stars;Stronger than I thought and they charge faster than normal.;The Motorola phone I got came with a 3-ft cord that was supposed to be lightning speed. This chord charges much faster and is much longer and more durable than the original. Also works great in the Motorola charging block and the USB charging port on my wall.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Was a little disappointed now long it took to change my phone.;To change my phone it took a long time. I like the cord being long. Well made. Just took to long to change.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Seems like a nice cord BUT doesn't charge fast.;We really like the quality of these cords however they do not charge fast at all.  They do seem durable. We have the fast charge turned on in our Galaxy S9's and they both error and say to check the cable but do charge while it shows that message. They show it will take 2+ hours to charge and my batter is at 70%! Not the fast charge I was looking for at all! When we switch to the charge that came with the phones it is an entirely different situation. If it charged fast like it claims, I'd give it more than 5 stars if I could. A fast charge is what I really NEEDED and why I purchased this set of cables. Thank you.
3.0 out of 5 stars;1 year review;I bought this in hopes of durability. At first they were really great strong cords. But about 5 months in the start curling. Now I can only get on side of the connector to actually work. So great product if you are just going to charge it and not use your phone. But using the phone while charging it will curl.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Last forever;I've had these charging cords now for almost 2 years and all still work perfectly!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Product does not meet expectations;I was very dissatisfied with this product. Had 2 of them and both quit working because they broke into right past the connector on the wire. To make this work better the reinforcement needs to be at least a inch long and use a higher durability wire that won't break into. I would not recommend this product and I will never purchase this product again from this supplier.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not really any faster;It doesn't charge any faster than my regular charger but it's super long and I like that.
5.0 out of 5 stars;good price;nice cables, seem to be pretty durable just the right size to keep in truck for charging
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great USB cables for My Car;I got these to keep in my car for all of the kids USB needs - they're perfect for long car trips. The cords haven't been damaged at all with a lot of sustained use. The red cord is easy to see - even in a dark car driving on the highway.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Does not light up;Maybe it was just me, cords are great. Looking at the picture, it makes it look like a blue light is neat the connection point. There is no light. Other than that, great cord
3.0 out of 5 stars;Would be a perfect charging cable if...;This charging cable is super long, charges well, plugs in nicely on both ends, with a great look!It does need some work on it's durability. I am very easy on my cables as I only use it while in bed. After only approximately a month of use, the end near the plug that connects it to the device became positional and required movement of the cable in order to charge the device.Please make the wiring a little tougher and I will give it as many stars as I am able.Thank you,
5.0 out of 5 stars;Nicely made quality cables at a good price;These were purchased for the length only, to replace the sorry 0.5 meter charging cable that came with my phone. Build quality is excellent, the cables are the flexible fabric-covered type, and the connectors seem to be of good quality. The price was good also, actually better than the shorter cables offered by the cable wholesaler we use at work. Only time will tell about durabilty. But so far, I'd recommend these with no reservations.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't work with Pixel Phones or the Anker battery bank I have.;Doesn't keep the connection going between my battery bank and phone. Tested with a pixel 2 XL and my new pixel 6 pro.Not buying this again. Maybe I just need to replace my battery bank with a usb C one so I can utilize USB-PD
2.0 out of 5 stars;Only 1 of the 2 cables work;I Bought a two pack of charging cables and when I received them, only one cable worked. I wasn’t going to bother returning them or writing a review but Amazon sent me an email saying that the cable seller wanted me to write a review and say whether or not I was satisfied.  For what it’s worth, the cables look and feel really nice and well manufactured unlike many of the cheaper charger cables I’ve gone through in the past but alas, I’m beginning to think that all cables are just cheap garbage. Some just look nicer than others. Anyway, I’m not expecting an apology or replacement from the seller but if they do send me a new replacement, I will certainly update this review to reflect it.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Price;Works
5.0 out of 5 stars;Very sturdy;Around USB good support if twisted... Overall very good sturdy quality. Comes with attached velcro strap for easy storage
3.0 out of 5 stars;The price;I like the length.  But I think my Samsung phone relies it's not Samsung cord so it slow down charging
5.0 out of 5 stars;Working great for me;All good
5.0 out of 5 stars;GREAT CHARGERS;Love this charger.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Worked well, for a year;I have several USB-C charging cables for my Samsung Galaxy S20FE. I purchased this cable in a 2-pack and another brand in a 3 pack. Of the 2 in this purchase, one only lasted 1 year. I just broke out the second one today, so time will tell if it lasts longer. The other brand (3 pack), one is in my car, one is at my wife's bedside table, and one is near the couch by my TV so I don't have to keep dragging cables all over the house. This cable was at my bedside table and rarely left that spot. It was not bent in weird, awkward ways. Just lightly used. Truthfully, the one in my car probably suffers the most abuse. But that one works wonderfully. This JSAUX cable just stopped working after a year. Not very impressive.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Great cables;I recommend these cables to anyone. And they shipped fast.  A bit longer than I need. But thats OK.  Good job
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great Charging cables;Great charging capability and long cords love them!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Awesome charger!;This is the only charging cord I've found that my phone thinks is a Samsung charger.  I have a Galaxy 10 and all other cords I've tried my phone gives me a message to use charger supported by my phone...and takes forever to charge. This charger is as fast or faster than the original Samsung charger.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Durability and charging power;Nothing yet
3.0 out of 5 stars;Best charging cord I own;Has taken many beatings so far, stretched out and even performed well amidst a storm
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great value! But can't transfer files;I've been enjoying using these. They're a great length and really durable for my level of use. However, I can't transfer info from my phone to the computer with these. I don't know if that's standard for after market cords, but I do think that's important note.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Na;Na
4.0 out of 5 stars;Work's great;Cable works great and it does what is supposed to do. I rate it 4 starts because the cable get's disconnected easily if you moved around, other then that works great.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Exactly what was described;Very durable
5.0 out of 5 stars;Reasonable;The cord charges fast on one side, the other side is super slow. The cord length is very nice and appreciated. the durability is okay it's able to last a little longer than regular cables, but try not to bend the charger at all, it starts to not work after barely bending on the charger's neck.
3.0 out of 5 stars;After 4-5 months, no longer works for quick charging;I got a 2-pack of these in August 2019. They worked great and appeared fairly heavy duty (doesn't seem to be any chance of these fraying). I got a 2-pack and kept one at home and one at work. By December, the one I use most often at home would no longer work for quick charging. Every time I plugged in my phone, a message would pop up telling me to check my charger connection and that quick charging would not function. It wasn't the case interfering and other cables worked just fine, so I thought maybe I accidentally bent the cord weird or something. So I switched the cables and brought the good one home to use. Within about a month, that one started giving me the same message. I have no idea why, but the quick charging functionality of these does not appear to last. It's fine for overnight charging but I'm buying a different cable next time.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Love the cables! But might be a problem for some with phone cases;"Great cable - very durable and has a ""cable saver"" near each plug section to protect against cable damage due to bending (had that problem with all the original cables). The only thing that might be a problem for some is if you have a case one your phone - the cable is just a hair bigger than most charging cables and might not fit through the charging port. It's not a problem for my lifeproof case but it wont fit in my husband's knockoff case.. might be a dealbreaker for some."
3.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn’t charge faster than the original cable;Maybe I got a dud, but it takes the original charger and cable from Apple from 1 to 100% a lot less time - at least 20 mins longer. I used the original charger with this cable because I needed a longer and durable one. I have the new IPad Pro 2TB if that helps any.
4.0 out of 5 stars;super good charger! durability a little rough though;this charger is super long, and i love that! the charging lower is pretty good (not the best) but i do think the charger material can bend and shift too easily. my whole cord is already bent and squiggly. it hasn’t ripped yet though and it works fine!!!
5.0 out of 5 stars;So far so good;So far so good, will take time to get a real feel for if it is any good.
3.0 out of 5 stars;MAKE SURE YOUR CASE OPENING FOR FEMALE C PORT HAS ENOUGH CLEARANCE - IT COULD BE AN ISSUE;"This looks like a VERY well made product. It's the first ones I ordered from this company having previously only used the AINOPE brand in recent years.HOWEVER, the one caveat I refer to is for the USB C connector to the cellphone, the thickness of the cable end may interfere with getting it into the cellphone female c receptacle depending on the size &thickness of the cellphone case opening for that connection.  I have to jiggle the cable a little to ""nudge"" it in fully since the edge of the case opening for my case very slightly catches the edge of the male c connector assembly.That's the only reason I gave this 3 stars instead of 5."
4.0 out of 5 stars;USB-C charge cable  for use with ONEPLUS 6T phone;"The USB Type C Cable, JSAUX (2-Pack 6.6FT) USB A 2.0 to USB-C Fast Charger Nylon Braided USB C CableDOES work with the ONEPLUS 6T fast charger to charge the phone. There is the tiniest play (wiggle) at the Type C connection, but the charge circuit is complete.I ordered several products through Amazon thinking that all USB-C connections would have universal specifications. The 3.8"" adapter for USB-C to 3.5mm which I ordered from another company (not a JSAUX product) has taught me to order OEM ONEPLUS cables directly from ONEPLUS.  I have experienced problems with the 3.8"" adapter and will return it."
5.0 out of 5 stars;As advertised - very happy with these cables;I now have one device that uses USB-c to charge. I bought these cables so I could use my existing arsenal of USB-A wall chargers and keep different cables at work and when I travel. These cables are of very high quality build and work perfectly. They are longer than I need for home/work charging, but you can obviously roll them up to the desired length. Better to  have the option for a little distance than not to have it.Overall, I have no complaints with this purchase and would highly recommend this product for anyone looking for durable USB-A to USB-c charging cables.
3.0 out of 5 stars;They work.;Bought for use in car. They work.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Only works well for a few months;Absolutely garbage product. Don't buy this. Will not fast charge after a few months.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great Cables While They Lasted;"These were great cables that I used with my Google Pixel 3 for about a year but then they started to require regular ""wiggling"" adjustment  on the usb-c connector side to get them to charge. I know its the cable and not the phone usb-c jack because I have other usb-c cables that don't require this. Too bad this only lasted for a year."
5.0 out of 5 stars;Sweet Moses!;I have never had a charger this amazing! My phone was down to 13% and this just arrived today. I plugged it in and within 15 minutes on my turbo charger block my phone is fully charged! You just found a lifetime customer! I've been through multiple cords on the same charging block and this has never happened! I also bought these cords for my mom for Christmas because she wanted longer cords. She doesn't use a turbo charger, but I know she loves these, so that's another reason why I decided to buy them as well. My last cords all stopped working. This never happened with these for my mom so I knew it would be a good investment!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great charging cord;These are long and durable. The coating made of quality material. These have charged my phone's and tablets in quick turbo time. I have bought several of these cords over the years.  These cords have always been dependable for me.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Durable;I have had this cord for over a year now and haven't noticed any real wear or tear on it. Granted I am not very hard on my charging cords. Even still this cord does as it says and has no problem fast charging on my Galaxy S10.
4.0 out of 5 stars;JSAUX braided cable;The cable came as expected.  It appears very durable. I have not checked if the charge is faster using this cable than the one that came with my tablet, but this cable appears to be more rugged in design.  I purchased the cable for durability and I believe it has that feature..  Fast charging is an added plus.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Worked great for a year;Bought this for my switch lite Dec. 2019 worked fine until now Jan 2021, it has stopped working as well and takes much longer to charge. It basically doesn’t charge if I want to use play while charging, it’s now gotten to where I have to leave it off to have the battery % go up.Stopped charging as efficiently after a year and it’s taking longer, though I’m not sure if this could be a problem with my switch’s battery.The other two issues are the rubber around the usb end broke off into two pieces, and it doesn’t fit snugly into my switch there’s some room to wiggle it side to side.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Bueno;Es de buena calidad y extensión, lo malo es que con mi Huawei p20 pro, no tiene compatible la carga rápida.
5.0 out of 5 stars;love the length;I always like to have a few extra of these laying around.  They are well made and the length is helpful.  I like to buy different colors for each family member.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not durable and doesn't charge well;I got this cord to replace once I'd had for long time that wasn't charging well any longer. In 6 months, it is damaged at the cord base (and it is well cared for as it just sits in the same spot next to my bed) and now charges incredibly slowly. Disappointed
3.0 out of 5 stars;Ok Charger;I liked the length of the cord. It doesn't seem to be fast charging, but it's an ok charger.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Inconsistent;I bought a 2 pack of these charging cords. The one my wife uses works well. The one I use won't charge my phone all the way. Other cords I have in my vehicle and work charge my phone great, so I know it's not the phone.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Cord does it's job well, but....;The shroud around the plug ends is a bit big so it can be a problem for cases with small charge port cutouts. Beware hard case users.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Best Charging Cord!;So glad I bought this product. More than enough length, extremely fast charge (can go from 5% to 100% in 1.5 hours), very durable, and amazing quality. And you get two for what you pay. I have the rose gold color so two cords for $13.99 was definitely worth it. Currently replacing every charing cord in the house with these.
4.0 out of 5 stars;As described;The cord was longer than I expected but turns out I like it that way. It charges similar to my original charger. Will see how durable it is over time
4.0 out of 5 stars;got what I expected when I placed the order;decent product at a reasonable price
4.0 out of 5 stars;Appears to be well made;When I connect it to transfer data to my phone it only works when inserted one way and not flipped the other but I think it might be an issue with my phone.
4.0 out of 5 stars;"Misleading picture; see attachment";Picture is a little misleading. Thought there was some blue mixed in but it’s just black. Still works and does what it’s supposed to.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Fast Charging;Glad I bought this set.  They work well with all my devices and also charge my phone up pretty fast.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Defective construction destroyed the port on my AC adapter;Take a close look at this connector.  Notice the black plastic with the four holes.  That plastic component does not belong there.  I plugged it into my ac adapter port and there was no charging, I could see that the USB connector was not fully inserted so I pressed it again, but still no charge.  When I withdrew it, I could see that the port was mangled.  Sure, I can get my money back but how much do I have to pay to replace my fast-charging ac adapter?  This has never happened to me before.  My advice is to stay away from this vendor/manufacturer and always check your cable connectors for perfection before inserting them into a charging port.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Charge cord;Works well this far, just got a short circuit somewhere in of the two I brought. Good length as well.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Charging time;The cable does not work well in the car, had trouble connecting.inside the home was ok, not that fast, but it worked. Length is very foo.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Degrades over time;I've had these cables for a little over a year or so. Recently, I noticed that they do not seem to charge as fast as they used to. For example, my Galaxy S20 charges up in about 2 hours or so (fast charge) with the factory supplied USB charging cable. When I went to charge up my phone with one of these cables, the estimated charge time was closer to 3 hours. The charging times used to match up for the two, but it's gradually been getting longer. I can't really recommend these cables in light of this, as I've never had any other cables with this issue. They look good and the cost up front is great, but be aware that they will not necessarily work very well the more they are used.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Seems good so far. Fast delivery;Only had for short time, but is a better and faster cable than my last one so far.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't fit correctly in to most devices.;Any slight movement disconnects any of my controllers and phones that use these cables.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Nice cords;I like that I got 2 for this price. They are just long enough for my needs. Not sure how they will hold up, but I've only had them for a couple of weeks.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good enough, great length, slower than expected to charge.;These are a nice length the charging time takes longer than expected to charge.Good for a hospital room.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Fast charging;It charges very fast. I gave it lower stars because it doesn't fit securely I to the phone. When I pick up my phone it slips out and I'm always reconnecting it.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good cable but wrong size;Cable would be perfect if it was the right size, ordered one for my GS-9 phone. Guess I have an early model because the cable is to big for my phone.
4.0 out of 5 stars;fast charger;I really like the long cord.  This allows me to plug in just about anywhere and be able to charge in comfort.  I like the many colors to choose from
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not good enough;These charging cords are pretty and that's about all I can say that's good. They were never fast charging, just average. Now, five months old, they don't charge at all anymore. They can't even help my phone hold a charge when it ISN'T BEING USED!
4.0 out of 5 stars;What I wanted in a cord;What I wanted in an extra cord.  Like the extra support at each end.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Can be a fast charger if you plug into a wall not a computer;Looks as described but if you plug the cord in to a computer to charge its very slow to charge you have to have a charging adapter for it to be a fast charger.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Must buy.;Need to use this with a power brick. My last cord didn't  have the rubber  around the plug and only lasted  2 months.  I have had this type of plug in other sizes for over a year.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Fast charger cord;I love this!! Putting a second order in now...UPDATE:  the second order came EMPTY. So with the return I will return an EMPTY package. The plus side, my return order should be delivered today!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Bent too easily;Product is okay but flimsy.
4.0 out of 5 stars;charging cord;So far the cord has been doing well, seems very sturdy and charges well
3.0 out of 5 stars;Kind of works;When playing games the audio messes up because this wire tends to get loose and its trying to decide which audio source to use. Then i get malfunction warnings and it just stops working. I guess its ok if you just leave the control alone to charge.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Stable at charger base;Me and my daughter like the reinforced black piece at the base of the cord. You can tell it's more stable. We haven't had them long to see any wear. However, my daughter tends to drag hers around and so far when I used it the other day I had no problems. Good buy.
4.0 out of 5 stars;It does the job;Worked as it was supposed to do.
3.0 out of 5 stars;It didn't hook up to the phone securely;Cord dlidn't remain attached to the phone. Cord would work out if the phone was moved much.
1.0 out of 5 stars;NOT A FAST CHARGING CABLE!;After I realize my device is take four times as long to charge, I took a look at the disclaimer and they have umpteen thousand disclaimers about how this cable cannot be used as a quick charge instead of using high quality material they chose to cheap out and sell you dog s***.If you want to waste your money and be disappointed in your purchase by this cable.This is 2022 the substandard Chinese garbage cables have no place in society anymore. I would have paid $15 for these cables if they were actually quick charge cables but they are not they're as slow as it gets.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works great;Length
5.0 out of 5 stars;They Seem Durable;These look like very durable charging cords, not the cheap plastic kind that I have bought in the past. They charge more quickly than the cheap ones too.
4.0 out of 5 stars;REVIEW: USB Type C Cable 3A Fast Charging [2-Pack 6.6ft], JSAUX USB-A to USB-C Charge Braided Cord;This product is as described. The 6-foot-6 length makes it very easy to use my device while it is being charged.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not FAST CAHRGING;Does not fast charge like it states. False advertisement.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Ok but last time there were 3 chargers;Disliked getting 2 chargers when last time I got 3.Chargers seem to work ok..except it takes much longer to charge my phone and ipad than it should
5.0 out of 5 stars;Magnífico;Resulto mejor de lo que esperaba. Carga super rápido, magnifico el largo del cable ya que me permite conectarlo en cualquier parte. Es muy resistente. Lo que me sorprenduo es que vinieron 2 cables en el mismo paquete. No había visto que eran 2. Fabuloso.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Hard to remove from phone;I liked the durability of the product and the cord length I chose.  However, it is very difficult to unplug from my phone.  I am going to have to try another product because I don't want to ruin my phone port from tugging so hard to get it out.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Now fast charging galaxy s9+;This product will not fast charge either of my Samsung s9+ phones. I have used multiple heads that do allot fast charge with the cable provided with phone. Nice cable other than the fact it's not fast charging.Update: after about a week they suddenly started fast charging devices. Raised to 4 stars because that seems strange that it now is working correctly and not from start.
4.0 out of 5 stars;They are kind of stiff, not that flexible.;Charging my phones
3.0 out of 5 stars;Didn't last long;Bought 2..1 has already stopped working. Less than 2 wks
3.0 out of 5 stars;These cables are the wrong size.;Wrong charging end. It’s hard to tell which size the charging end is if you’re not technical.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect;Bought 2 of these and both work perfectly.  They feel durable so I'm confident they'll last a while
2.0 out of 5 stars;Life is 6 months;It's been 6 months and the charger has broken
5.0 out of 5 stars;Nice and long.;Our samsungs come with short little cords and these are nice and long allowing us to sit farther away from an outlet if we need to use the phoone while charging it. The red color makes them easy to distinguish from the many other black charging cables in our home.The cord didn't come with the outlet plug, which didn't matter for us because we just used the one that came with the phone since we put the short cords in our cars and didn't need them there. But we just didn't realize that or read the product description closely enough when we purchased these.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped working after a few years;Worked for a few years then stopped working for my primary phone. It's a cable I just need it to to work. May have used it it in car so it has been exposed to outdoor temperatures at times
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good value for the money!;Loved the durability of the cord so far. Has worked perfectly with my Samsung smart phone. The only problem was originally I wasn't fully inserting the cable into the wall mount and phone wasn't charging!  However that was my mistake and nothing to do with the cable!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Bought this on September 8th 2018 ,I've only used 1 of the 2 pack and it stopped working today;At first this cord worked great, now 1 of the 2 cords stopped working the last few days on and off but stopped. Playing around with it some  does make it work but it's at the point where it's useless so now I'm using the 2nd cord I've never used and it works like new with no problems,for now. This is common with android charging cords except in the beginning but I used Motorola when Android phones were first released and those cords lasted a long time. I love Samsung but the chargers that came with their phones have a history of not lasting long . The (C) version seem to be better but so far no company has manufactured a charging cord that's durable and long lasting, sure most cords wear out but they should last close to a year and Samsung shouldn't be the one's who make a charging cord that lasts longer than any other manufacturer that doesn't make the phone. They are getting better though on the bright side. Somewhat Recommended (just try to take care of them)
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works decent for about 10 months;Love the color and they worked better than a cord from dollar store or cheap one from Walmart. They only lasted about a year though. Then phone would show 100% but as soon as I took it off within 5 minutes I'd be down to 40% or less (using it or not).
5.0 out of 5 stars;High quality cable. Nylon braid is perfect. Cable ends fit snugly.;Cable is made of high quality materials and is better than an any other USB to C cable you will find anywhere. The nylon braid makes the cable easy to handle and the cable ends fit snugly. love the red color. Highly recommend.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good cords;Cords didn't have the blue reinforcements on the ends as shown in the picture.  Still a good cord though.
4.0 out of 5 stars;A solid cable;These cables have a solid feel to them. I like the red color, too. My only concern is the connector. (I am not a techie, so please bear with my description!) The part that connects to my phone is a teeny bit too large. It fits, and it works great, but I am concerned that it will eventually cause problems and cause the connector that came with the phone to be loose. If that makes sense to you, good. If I'm wrong, I apologize! But all in all, this is a solid piece of workmanship!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good charging cord;"Good thing this item had 2 cords cause one of them ""doesn't "" support the fast charging option. I've been hoping the one that works doesn't fail on me. That's the only thing im bumped out bout. I like the length of the cords. If my cord fails me ill request a refund"
3.0 out of 5 stars;I would buy again if needed.;"I only needed the one, but it's always good to have a spare.  Power cord seems to be of high quality and a great length. Both of the cords seem to have a problem ""locking"" in to my phone. I had to take one when it arrived on a trip  I got a little frustrated with it always falling out of my phone when charging. So I grabbed  a pair pliers and pinched the width of the connector just a ever so tiny a bit. Now it works perfectly."
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not worth the money;The two cords didn't make it four months that not even two months per cord. I bought them because they have the ends that are flexible. But it seemed to break down faster so don't waste your money. Bought on June 28 2021 todays date October 10 2021 the second one died today.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Didn't Fit in 2019 Highlander;This is the third set of similar charging cords I have purchased. I really enjoyed the first two.The third set was purchased for use in my new car.  We had great difficulty fitting the cord into the charging plug as it was extremely tight. So tight in fact, that it pulled out the entire charging piece from the vehicle. I changed that cord for another, and it works and fits properly. Perhaps the new one's measurements are slightly off. In any case, I'm using it in the house and it's fine.I thought I had ordered red cords but they came in blue. Doesn't matter.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Long, durable and red 😊;Tge scotch part that is used to pack the cord, is sticky. Sticks to fleece, shirts....Other than that, excellent item for a good price
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good quality cables no faster in my USB port of my car than other cables;I was attracted to the promise of faster charging and the red cord color which coordinates with the red inside my car interior......But I don't feel any faster charging using these cables in my USB port of my carThe cables are in fact durable and they're of good quality.... I just don't feel them charging any faster than any other cable I've used in the car.  Are these faster only when used with an AC outlet plug in the home maybe?  Certainly not faster in my car
4.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't fast charge Pixel devices! Whoops!;Well, I failed to read the product information, and assume that this would fast charge my Pixel 3XL, but google felt the need to use proprietary technology. So, that's my fault. Other than that, these seem like high quality cables. Tough sleeving, rigid rubber at each end to (hopefully) prevent damage.All in all, I don't have an issue with these. i just wish I had spent the time to read the product info!
3.0 out of 5 stars;3 star for one reason;the only reason i'm giving a 3 star is cause one of the cords came in broken . but the one that does work is amazing and it works with my fast charge and thats all i care
5.0 out of 5 stars;Very durable cord!;I really like these cords. They are very durable and lasting
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great charging cable, Normal charging speed not fast;I definitely wouldn't consider it fast charging It charges at normal speed but it's still a very durable and nice charging cord, still pleased with my purchase
4.0 out of 5 stars;A bit too long... which makes it tend to bend.;"Last thing you want to do with a USB cable is bend it. But with the length of this cord, I find that in order to get it out of the way, everyone wants to bend it to their specifications--which will, of course, break the fibers.  I would next time opt for a model that is maybe 18"" shorter."
5.0 out of 5 stars;good;works well
4.0 out of 5 stars;Cable;Charges ok
3.0 out of 5 stars;Cheap;I purchased this charger twice and both times it stopped working after two months
5.0 out of 5 stars;These are great;You get 2 6 foot cords, just the cords, which is fine because I knew that before buying them. I needed a long cord for by the couch and one for the car. They are perfect and charge pretty fast. I recommend.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Be strong, hold together. Please & ty;I'd give these cables 5 stars if I could absolutely prognosticate their longevity.  They seem well put together, charges well but they are nearly brand new, reasonably priced.  Everything I was wanting as long as they don't come apart.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good except fast charge to Chromebook;See review title
5.0 out of 5 stars;Very strong cord I love it.;I really like this cord alot it's tough & very sturdy and it charger my phone and portable devices in my house.  It's terrific the best product I purchased I will be purchasing another cord soon.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great performance and value;My kids wore out their Nintendo Switch power cords, which were not the most robust cords to begin with.  I ordered these from Amazon and they immediately appeared to be of a higher quality, and seem to charge much more quickly.  I believe these will last much longer than the ones that came with the Switch, and the value is exceptional.  Very happy with purchase.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great Cable, Great Price;I expected any cable not sold by Samsung to charge slower. This one is better than the cable my Samsung Galaxy S10e came with. The length allows me to comfortably use my phone while charging and the cable, so far, seems very durable. Also very satisfied with the price.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Seem like quality cables. We'll see. Nice color.;I really like the attached velcro wrap on each cable.Great idea. Seems like a nice cable. Hopefully it lasts a long while. Appears durable. It's long! 6 ft is a long cable. They should make 4 footers! 3 is too short and 6 is too long
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good buy;Braided exterior should be resistant to abrasion (I needed this because I ran over OEM cord with vacuum cleaner, which left bare wires showing), and color (red) is easy to find.  Only drawback is that sometimes, when looking for cord in the dark (after my wife has gone to bed), that I can't find it because I'm standing on it.  But works well, and should last for a long time.  Yes, I would buy this again.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Just what I needed;These work great, I have had no problems with these charging cords. I love the length and it has a velcro loop on it if you like it a bit shorter. The only issue I had was with my phone case popping the charger out of my phone, not with the cable itself. Great chargers
5.0 out of 5 stars;This cord changed EVERYTHING!;This charging cord changed my life! No longer am I reduced to sitting next to the wall with my phone plugged into a super short cord. I can sit on the sofa! I can be out in my yard! I've even been able to use the bathroom, all without losing a moment of charging power. I did not know what freedom truly was, until I started charging with this cord.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Didn't even get six months use per cord;I have owned these for over a year. They come as two. Individual I got about 6 months use. Which is ridiculous!They are both failing to charge now. And I only started using the second one 5 months ago.  Was great as far as the length 6.6ft, and durability /sturdiness of it, it even matches my phone case perfectly which was a nice surprise. Be mindful of what cause you buy. The one I had wasn't tooled big enough for the head of the cord to seat properly. It feels like it enters in there securely and snuggly, but it doesn't. the slightest movement of the phone the cord falls right out depending on the case and how it is made.There's a bit of a snap as it goes into your phone if there is no case.  If you are handling your phone while it's charging you're going to fight with this cord as it will constantly fall out of your phone. I don't know if it's because it might be a little too heavy to stay anchored as you're handling it or what the case may be but I'm finding that I am constantly having to plug my cord into my phone. Which is annoying. Very disappointed.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Disappointed;Does not charge my son's S8 as all, and my S10 is very slow to charge
5.0 out of 5 stars;We liked them so much, we bought 2 more!;We've used these for a couple years and never had any problems.  So when we needed chargers in our vehicles, we bought 2 more.  Very satisfied!  Charges fast, the length is perfect and it's sturdy.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great;Great
4.0 out of 5 stars;Cable Corto para Celular;La distancia es buena para carga como cuando estas en la compu y me gusta el color del cable, son duraderos y carga muy bien. Recomendados
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great cord;The cord is great. Unfortunately I didn't pay close enough attention when ordering as I wanted a cord with the wall plug.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Worth It;So my original phone cord was 2ft in length so I was looking for something longer and durable. So far this cord is perfect! And it came as a 2-pack so I got double the cord. The 6ft length is perfect. It charges really fast, within 1-2 hours for a full charge. And the color is pretty too. Worth it.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Better end design;So far they have worked well. Others I have purchase worked well for a while too and then the end where the cord and Jack connect to each other frayed. These have a protector on the end to prevent that. Hopefully a couple of months down the road they will still be working. But the design seems much better.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Same old same old.;Not great. So tired of having to buy all these cords for devices I own only to have them crap out on me a short time later. It would seem all the geniuses at these tech companies would resolve this ridiculous issue.  I don’t have to buy cords for appliances, televisions, etc. This is just so dumb. So this does what all the other ones do. Works at first then a month or two later it stops working.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great!!!;Very quality cord, the extra rubber helps the durability when using the phone while its charging. Doesn't charge super fast but gets the job done.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Durability AND must be multi colored;I partially ordered it bc it was multi colored which was which was what I wanted was to separate from all the other cords at my house for everybody else and fortunately when I got it it was a plain red cord so it doesn't stand out because we have plenty of red cords around here so would have been nice if they stated that it was not red and blue or change the picture so it looks like the actual cord
4.0 out of 5 stars;Color can be misleading;The color i wanted does not match the color of cord. I chose green but the cord is more of teal. Otherwise, its good so far.
3.0 out of 5 stars;As expected. Good purchase.;These cords are worth the price. I've purchased them before and they are fine. Don't last too long...about 4-6 months...before they start presenting problems.  But still happy with them.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Very good charging cables;I'm giving these cords a 4 out of 5 because of their stiffness.  I was hoping they were a bit more pliable.  They aren't super stiff, but they are not as pliable as I was looking for.  The length is great. they allow my Galaxy S10+ to fast charge. and they feel well made.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great item;The item seems very durable and has a snug fit almost as it clicks into place so far I'm happy with the proand would purchase again.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice cable;Mounted the power supply behind the dash in my truck.plenty of cable,I love the length. Didn't know there were 2 cables in the box. Which was a surprise.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Charging port started smoking on S10;Have used this brand in the past and reordered a longer cord, same brand and make. Charging port on my S10 started smoking after using these 5 times, visible scorch marks and melted plastic on the inside of the charging end. Had to buy a new phone
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great Cables;Works great, very durable
2.0 out of 5 stars;Inconsistent, great at first but, now it is not charging all the time;The connection is solid to my phone, but the cable appears to be giving out. Inconsistent charging and I have to straighten out the cord. it's like the wire inside is breaking.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Okay Cable;Decent quality cable, very stiff and material is rough against the skin (worse between the toes, ask me how I know). Connectors on either end are solid for now with little to no wiggle. I get high speed charging using my Samsung wall wart. Will update as time goes by if necessary.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Super product;This is the best phone charging  cord I have ever purchased... Fantastic.....  And you get two of them.  Just one would have been great but two..  Even better..  Super  fast changing.  ❤️  love everything  about it..  Thank you for a great product
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works well;Works as should. Have purchased before. They seem to last as other cords I have purchased stop charging
5.0 out of 5 stars;Excellent customer service !;I would definitely order these again.  Excellent customer service. I had ordered these cables a few months ago. Unfortunately I failed to check both cords. I recently tried using the 2nd cord and it did not work at all. I contacted their customer service and they kindly and swiftly corrected the issue. Kudos!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great quality!;Really enjoying these so far, especially the length, so I don't have to be married to the wall plug when I use my phone while charging. They fit my LG V20 perfectly, and they work great with my LG fast chargers. Only had them a few days, so time will tell on the durability, but they look and feel really sturdy, and I really like the red and black. I'd pay for one what I paid for this two-pack. the quality seems that good to me. Definitely worth it.
1.0 out of 5 stars;"JSAUX USB ""C"" cable will not stay in my Samsung Galaxy S8";"JSAUX USB ""C"" cable will not stay in my Samsung Galaxy S8.  The quality of this cable is otherwise great.  My problem is that the USB C end falls out of my phone.  It takes very little to disconnect it.  I did have a problem with my phone a while back with charging, and I discovered I had to clean and blow out my Samsung USB C socket.  I now clean it every month or so."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Rugged Cable, Built To Last;Great cable, very rugged and seems like it will last a long time. Perfect length, my only issue is the cable is very stiff, doesnt bend well for using ur device while charging, but that's just a personal complaint. Very good cable!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Quality Cable;Cord cable and ends are very sturdy and comes cleanly packed. Feels and looks higher quality than standard or cheap cables. Recommend pairing these with the fast wall charger block. Will see how they hold up in long run but got a feeling they will last.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Well made stress reliefs but apparently have some issues with manufacturing uniformity;The cables appear to be well made but one of the 2 cables that came in the box will not fast charge my phone.  I tried both cables with all 3 fast chargers I have & one fast charges my phone with each of the 3 fast chargers.  The other cable will not fast charge with any of the 3 fast chargers I have.  So, there is clearly some manufacturing variation that JSAUX needs to work on.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Actually lasts more than a couple months;These charging cables are made very well and seem to be standing up to usual heavy use. Every cable I have ever had falls apart, some after a few weeks some after a few months. These are like new and going strong after 6 months. No bending metal part at the phone, which is always the beginning of the end.
4.0 out of 5 stars;It works;Does what it is supposed to do
5.0 out of 5 stars;They are very durable!;Love these charging cords!! I like to sit in my recliner and play xbox but the wall outlet is a few feet away and my charging cable that came with my phone was not long enough, so I would have to pause my game and get up to check any notifications. Now my phone can sit in my lap while charging, and it dont seem to take nearly as long to completely charge my phone!! Plus I love the red color that I was able to get!!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not a fast charging, wont stay plugged.;I bought 4 of them a while back, we have noticed they take too long to charge when we use them. Unlike other chargers we have with fast charging.Wont stay plugged to our phones.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great Cord;I like all of it's features
1.0 out of 5 stars;Already failing in less than 2 weeks time.;On day 10, one of the two charger cables is barely charging. After leaving my phone on the charger for over 3 hrs, total charge 6% since plugging in. Planning to return.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not all 3 the same;3 to the pack.  1 of them quit working in less than a week . Of the other 2 , mine is still working and charges pretty fast. The one my daughter uses still works but doesn't charge very fast.  But, considering the price,  I would probably buy again.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great for the Price;I purchased this charger for use at work and in the car if need. I have only used it a couple of times. This charges just as quickly as the original charger. The cord length is actually more than I need, which is great because I'd rather have more than not enough. I cannot speak to its durability as of yet, which is why it only received 4-stars in that area. Overall, 5-star product. I will update my review once I've used it longer.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Very strong cord!;Order Came in the mail today and Upon opening the package, I could see how strong and durable this cable is. Its compatible with fast charge for my s9 and the length is a plus! So far so good! Will try to come back for an update.UPDATE 1/1/2020A year and some change later and this crap stopped working. I have to lay my phone in a particular way before its able to charge. It was good while it lasted tho.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great, durable charging cord;I like to keep charging cords in a few places in my house and this three pack was not only a great price - the cords are long enough to allow me to charge anywhere. The braided cord is durable and almost 2 years later are still holding up without any fraying or bend in the cord. This is a good buy!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great for the price;It is rather shallow so it falls out easy
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great product;So far has been very durable and charges my phone extremely quick.  Wouldn't definitely buy again.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Extremely rigid;These cables are extremely rigid compared to other brands.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Above average cables.;10 month update: One cable, the one I used at home has failed. The second one that I use in my car is still working well. I can actually feel that the bad one fits looser into my phone than the good one does. I still really like these, and would probably buy them again.These are sweet cables! The packaging and overall presentation make them nice to give as a gift to a co-worker or casual friend.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Is Only Half Working;I've had this cord for a little over half a year, and while it still charges when it's plugged into the charging box that plugs into a wall outlet, it will no longer charge if it's just plugged into a regular USB port (in your car, or portable chargers). This is highly inconvenient as no one has access to a wall outlet 24/7.
4.0 out of 5 stars;It works;Really is much too long but am keeping.Havent used it yet
5.0 out of 5 stars;I'm replacing all my Mac cords with JSAUX;I'm replacing all my Mac cords with JSAUX. They are much sturdier, and it's easy to get a very long cord. I bought my first JSAUX cord July 10, 2020. Very satisfied.
4.0 out of 5 stars;not Durable,short Life span, then they die;cord died after less than a year of use.Not THAT durable.they stopped working.disappointed!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Best charging cable ever!;Great charger at a great price
4.0 out of 5 stars;Well made, love the reinforcement about an inch long that keeps both ends wires breaking ends;I ordered this product awhile back (9 months?) And have been pleased with it for the most part, but one of the cords spider malfunctioning and not giving a steady charge. I can hear it click click click click when the connection starts and then it stops. The second 1 works perfectly.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Definitely tough, but not toughest.;Second cord, only because the first one wore out at the connector. I can be hard on these, so be aware if you flex alot it may go out.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Pretty good;Definitely one of the better Chargers you can buy off Amazon so far this one lasted longer than 3 months
4.0 out of 5 stars;Cord length;If you are looking for a long charger cord, I recommend this product!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Durable and Lengthy;I wasn’t expecting two. But that’s fine. I love how much longer and thicker this cord is compared to the dinky, tiny one that my wireless headphone set came with. Now charging my headphones won’t be such a pain in the butt.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Ok;These get hot with some of my devices.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Worth the joney;Very durable usb-c charging cable - long enough to reach outlet and still use phone
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great Buy;"I have nothing negative to say about these charging chords.  Plenty of length,  very durable,  and the different colors ensure nobody is walking away with my cord ""by mistake""."
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good, but only a few months later, cord is twisting.;This cord has started to wind and contort in weird ways but still works.I would rate 5 stars but for some reason the cord/coating has seemeed to be twistingWe  gently used this items  to charge our electrinics  and the wear these cords seem to have after only a few months makes me question the true quality.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great cord, may need modification;Great charger. It will not fit correctly to use on devices in some cases. You could either take the case off each time or remove the wrapped red metal edge. I did this with a pair of pliers. Perfect!
4.0 out of 5 stars;why do I need a headline for a review?;Nice long cord, looks durable
5.0 out of 5 stars;Strong, works;They seem to be the toughest of the ones that I have purchased lately. They're not falling apart or failing to work after a few weeks like most of them.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Sturdy cable;Nice looking cable. Appears to be of a good thickness. Should handle rapid charging fine with the proper charging brick. Sturdy. Feels tough enough to handle our needs. Time will tell if it is cat proof. It has so far lasted longer than the last one. Got these to replace one chewed up by our kitten, and another older cable beginning to fray near the connector.Will update this in a few months if they survive.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Excelente carga el teléfono muy rapido.;Me encanto por que carga bien rapido
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not a fast charging cable;This cord charges, but doesn't fast charge. Tested using an outlet that provides fast charging via another cable from the same brand.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Doesnt work consistently;Doesnt work consistently  Not impressed.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good Cables;They fit and charge my wife's S9 and appear to be durable.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't fit through my case;These seem to be nice cables. Fast charging works. I haven't had them long enough to know whether they're durable, but they appear to be. I'm giving them only three stars because the metal strain relief is too fat to fit through my phone case, so I can't charge the phone with the case on. I've gone through many cables, and this is the first time I've had that happen.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Does the job;Works great very long length and it looks like it would last for very long time but sadly it doesnt charge fast enough.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Lies;These cords are not fast chargers at all. I have a Samsung rapid fast charger plug and these cords are far from giving any kind of fast/rapid charge...dont be mistaken
1.0 out of 5 stars;Started on fire - melted my phone's charging port;It's lucky I was by my phone after plugging it in. I smelled something burning, looked around, and saw a plume of smoke coming from my phone's charging port. I pulled the cable out and it was hot to the touch. Now my phone's charging port is melted and I cannot plug it in to charge it ever again.
4.0 out of 5 stars;good purchase;cable does the job efficiently but I have to remove the otterbox cover as it is too short to go in with the cover left in tact.
4.0 out of 5 stars;I like them;I really like them. But since I use it all the time and have the cable in my pocket, I have found they weaken and stop charging my phone from my battery.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Does what you'd expect;Seems relatively durable and gets the job done.
4.0 out of 5 stars;All good  best thing out;Get one that all you need
3.0 out of 5 stars;IDK why but I go through chargers like a hot knife through butter....;This is the umpteenth, out of many replacement charging cables that I've bought from this site for cellphones I've used in the past.And even though I've purchased several for my currently activated model, a ZTE Blade ZMax, this IS however, the first one I got from Amazon for device, not to mention my 1st 'Type-C USB-ported' device, altogether.These are ok. Nothing special.I will say that these like other the cables, fail to 'fast charge' unless I turn off the phone before plugging it into the phone's port.After that I also have to take a fairly long, strong, elastic band to tug back on the base of the C-plug/port, while securing the other end of the band over the top of the phone, for it to continually charge without losing power.Other than that, it's cool.IDK if these cords come with a warranty or not, but if not, oh well.They're cheap enough, I suppose...
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works great;Works great, a little large and busier than I would like.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good for the price;There are very Harvey duty. Charged fine. I like the quality. Im thinking about getting a 10ft one as well
1.0 out of 5 stars;Conector too tight, killed the USB-C port on my phone;"I bought two of these. I put one in my car to connect my new Samsung phone to the car's mapping system. The connector was ""nice and tight"" I thought this was a good thing. Eventually, the USB port died and had to be replaced at my cost. Samsung deemed it was damaged by the user and would not repair it under warranty.The other cable was looser when I connected it to the phone. if I would have known the other being tight was a problem I could have returned it and use the loser one. Hard lesson learned."
2.0 out of 5 stars;Its only good for about 2 or 3 months;After 2 or 3 months it stops working properly. After that it just breaks, dosen't fast charge, needs to unplugged and then re plugged to get it to charge. Don't buy it
4.0 out of 5 stars;Hope you like red!;Good, nice looking, has cord support at the plug.  Most of these charger cords fail because the wires break inside the cord at the plug.These were also inexpensive enough to add to my order and get free shipping.  So cost me about $2 each, good deal.  My decor doesn't support red very well. My only complaint.
5.0 out of 5 stars;a long cord;"I was looking for a long cord to reach from the outlet to my bedside.  The length is exactly what I needed.  It is made from ""tangle"" resistant material which is a big plus."
5.0 out of 5 stars;High Visibility and strong USB-A to USB-C Cable;This cable is great for several reasons. First, the bright red color of the nylon braid really stands out. Second, the quality and durability of the cable reminds me of military-grade wire harnesses found in aircraft. Third, the length of cable easily stretches from the wall outlet to the night stand next to the bed it without causing a trip hazard. Lastly, it comes with a Velcro tie strap to aid in storage or coil any excess cable. I am very satisfied with this product. A+ in my book!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works great in our car;When it was time for an update we bought a couple of Samsung phones.  We bought two stand up fast wireless chargers for around the house...but needed something for the car.  My wife works in IT so access to power is important to her job...and I just like being able to charge on the go when I need to...so I bought these to use in the car.  They seem strong and well made...and do seem to charge very fast.  I'd absolutely recommend them!
2.0 out of 5 stars;worst;for the first month it charges fast then after that it stops charging and I bout this twice and its the same problem
4.0 out of 5 stars;Very great quality;Very durable cords. They are very well made and I love the length. In the car though they dont charge that fast at all haven't tried to charge in my house with them yet I just bought them solely for the car. They seem like they will last a long time.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Very good cables;The cable performs as described.  Cord length allows me to use my phone while it's charging.  The cord is reinforced at its pressure points.  I am very confident that it will continue to be a very satisfying product.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Looks Lovely, Performs poorly;Seemed very nice at first. Looks good, seemed well made. But, not very durable. I received the product February 27th. By April 28th, the contacts in the end of the cable have either bent or worn to the point that the cable has to be held at a slight angle for my phone to charge. The Dollar store cables last almost that long.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good length cord but often getting CONNECTON ERRORS and it will not fast charge like the original;I love how long these cords are compared to the original that came with the phone. However, I keep getting connection errors where the phone won't charge or won't go into the rapid charge with these. I'm not sure whether to keep using them or not. Usually the error message says to check the connection, and it doesn't go into the fast charging. A few times I've had a message about it draining more rapidly than it can charge, so it must be charging very slowly at those times. I see some other reviews mention similar problems with it not connecting fully, but I'm not sure if a solution was found or if they needed a replacement.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Qué cumplió mi expectativa;Todo fue perfecto gracias
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great for charging kids devices in the car during travel;Long cable, reaching from charging port in front seat easily to back seat of my Camry. Charges kids Nitendo Switch while they are still able to play at same time.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Love the length;Love the length of this however no longer than i have had it , it has a short in it where it bends. Ill have to tape it up before it unravels.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Best Cord I have Found!;Great productCharging cordLength and the material that is made from.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Needed the length;I needed a long charger so I can lay in bed with it without movement restrictions. This is perfect.  The kid can also sit in the backseat and charge the phone from the front port since its long enough
3.0 out of 5 stars;Great when it works;i've had this cable for almost 2 months and it was great, although loose fitting when I first got it. I use it in my car to connect to my android auto. About a week ago it started to not always work when I plugged it in. the cable will be completely plugged in the phone yet my car won't register it. now i have the problem that it only works when plugged in with the writing faced down and placed gently in my center console. when it does work it still charges fast and the cable is still in tact it just doesn't fit tight in the charging port for some reason. I know it's not the car or phone because i will use my other charger without issue when this one bothers me enough.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great item bad delivery service;Cables works great but had a issue with delivery service. Usually would end up in my mailbox but I got home and it was sitting on my porch. I had a buddy staying at my place cause I knew a package was coming and they never even knocked. I would have been upset if it gotten stolen. Believe this is more of postal service issue but really irritated me.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Love the length;Had to replace old plastic covered cable.  It wore out in just a few months
4.0 out of 5 stars;Decent;The reason i put 4 stars is because this weird thing when I charge my phone with it it takes about 3 sec to say supercharging idk why is that I don't think it's because the length of the cable other than that it's solid
5.0 out of 5 stars;Amazing;The length  and durability  is great.  And they charge great.
4.0 out of 5 stars;No more frustration;I love the length and fast charging. No frustrations
5.0 out of 5 stars;It charges very fast!!;I was very impressed with its durability as well how fast it charges.  It charges much faster than my previous cord did. I ordered 6 ft cord. I am very happy with it.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Nice long cable that worked great for awhile;I liked the cable design but one of the two cables went bad after about 8 months. It was the one that I use daily. The other one that is occasional use for travel is still working fine.  I have questions about the durability of these cables.  I am pretty hard on my cables but if you are going to make a point about how durable your cables are then you need to deliver.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great value for the money;I use this to charge at home and at work.  I have cords at home, work, at my away place and in the car.  I do like the longer cord since I can sit in bed, use it while in the car and in general not strapped to something. It is pretty sturdy
5.0 out of 5 stars;Does it's job;So far so good woth these charging cables. Not sure if your phone will fast charge with a regular changing block, I wouldn't expect it to. My fast charging block works well with these cords. I suggest using the Velcro that keeps the cord together as much as possible. Less risk of the cord itself getting caught on something, damaged, etc...
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good cord, doesn't fast charge for my phone though.;Awesome length, cord seems durable. Unfortunately, it does not support fast charge for my OnePlus 6T.. does charge, but at a regular (slow) rate. A bit of a disappointment since that's partially why I bought it.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Very good!;Firstly, I really appreciate the length of the cord being that I am always on my phone while I'm in bed so I need a long cord to work with. Secondly, the cord seems well made and durable so far which is a definite plus. It connects to my phone very securely ensuring a solid quick charge. 👍🏽
5.0 out of 5 stars;Still working!;I've had these for over a year. They still work well and aren't getting frazzled or splitting at the top! I love them worth the money!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Damaged box;Seemed to work fine, and it's fast charging. The only thing that bugs me was the box. The box was damaged so I'm not sure if the item was used or not.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good materials, solid product;Great material, use it as an Xbox Series X controller charging cable and it does a great job.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Very nice cable;I like the quality of this cable,  but I guess I should have gotten a shorter one. I have it wound up and tied up, to only be as long as I need.
4.0 out of 5 stars;out standing;very good product.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Makes phone think there is water in the connection! DO NOT BUY THESE!!;I purchased these for a trip, for extras in case I lost the original in all the goings on..  1st time I used one, I thought the connection to the cigarette lighter adaptor was messed up, so I tried another adaptor and had the same issue.. would not charge the phone.  I took them in the hotel room and when I used them, it told me that there was moisture in the connection of the phone.. wrong.. no moisture!  My phone was in my by backpack, nowhere near water!  Kept getting the same message, so I switched to the other one in the package.. same damn thing, would not charge and there was water in the phone.  Did the same thing with my friends phone.... When I got back home, I tried again, one last time using the electric outlet adaptor and had the same results so I know it is the cables.  When I plug in my other cables, no problems whatsoever!! We are back to late to send these back, so I will just pitch them in the trash.  DO NOT BUY THESE CORDS THEY WILL GIVE YOU ERRORS AND NOT CHARGE YOUR PHONES!
2.0 out of 5 stars;One did great,one did not!;One charges. Fine,the other not so much.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Snug f it tit l;Nice tight fit in the socket
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great first impressions.;The quality of the cables seems solid.  USB-C is slightly easier to connect then microUSB.  (Not that microUSB is particularly difficult.)  I have only had it for a couple days so I can't comment on the durability but I suspect it will hold up well.  Each end of the cable has an aluminum shell with a rubber strain relief.  The cables are each braided as depicted in the images and include a Velcro tie wrap for keeping the cable organized when not in use.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great Chord!;Pros: long, cheap, stylish, cool to the touch, and has a velcro clip to store it.Cons: I've had it for about 2months and I can sense that it will probably break at the USB to wire connection (it's getting more and more flimsy as the months go on but the pros far out weight the single CON I found
3.0 out of 5 stars;My last cord charged in half the time.;The cord seems sturdy but it is taking much longer to charge than my old cord - by a full hour.
5.0 out of 5 stars;really nice cable;It's a very nice cable and works very well. Very long and has plenty of reach.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Not the fastest charging, but gets the job done with plenty of durable length.;It's a long a** charging cable. Way better than gas station/convince store junk. It's probably more durable than what you're plugging it into. Ordered some 8 months ago. Liked them enough to order another pair👊
5.0 out of 5 stars;The order was awesome;My expectations were met . The charger was I ordered was perfect. My daughter loved it. I Am so grateful for Amazon.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Broke down in 2 years;They both wore out in 2021
4.0 out of 5 stars;These do the job;Long enough, and appears the build is solid enough to actually last.  Have had for many months and no signs of wear. One in the vehicle, one at the office desk.  They don't get twirled, etc. as the kids tend to do so I cannot attest to that capability, but they are holding up very well for me. Pleased and would buy more.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Awesome;I love this charger. These types help keep my cat from chewing through the wire. My friend is gonna love the red color. I'm giving the second one to them.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great quality cords!;These cables are very good quality. I bought the pink ones to match my pink Samsung Galaxy s20. Perfect color match! I bought the 6 ft length. They are perfect! I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for cell charging cords. Love that they come in fun color choices too.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging! Disappointing!;Edit: they are fast charging but don't stay plugged into my phone. Another charger I have stays in place and these always come un plugged. I had my phone plugged in for the night with an alarm set and the charger just fell out and my phone died. My car charger stays plugged in. Too much of a hassleI received this today after reading reviews. My old charger cords are breaking and not working, so I thought I'd get these. I checked my settings and fast charging is enabled and the charger I had holding on by a wire fast changed my phone. Very disappointed this one does NOT! Trying to decide if I'm going to send them back or not. Good length and durable, just not fast charging which is important to me. Not very happy.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great Cord Length;Bought this to charge up a new Samsung Galaxy phone and really appreciate the long cord length. I like the red color too -- easy to differentiate from other cords.
5.0 out of 5 stars;These are great;These charge your phone quickly and easily. Long cords so there easy to keep close by.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Durable, long cord and charges fast!;Long cord... Received two chargers in each pack we purchased, so my husband and I can both have one by our bedside and one in the loveseat. he also took one to his office.  Charges full and fast! Very durable cord. I bought pink and got hubby red.... Loved the color choices!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice vibrant color.;They seem to be working just as described. Cable feels ok As of right now I  am happy with the product.
5.0 out of 5 stars;The best charger I've ever bought;This is one of the best chargers I've ever bought. It charges fast and it doesn't break easy .its plugged into my laptop and I charge my phone that way. Love it
4.0 out of 5 stars;Deeeeeeeee cent.;Durable, good length. Sometimes my phone pretty much rejects them and it'll lose charge will plugged in and I have to unplug and plug it back in a couple times, but not a huge inconvenience. more durable than the cord Verizon gave me
5.0 out of 5 stars;Durable, resistant to cats and accidents.;I love these wires so much. Our cats are wire biters and even we bend the wires awkwardly at times. The fabric protects from the biting and the protection between the cord and the charging head is wonderful at preventing the wiring from coming out and ultimately not working any more. I don't know why others don't use this wonderful design (besides to be cheap and sell more) but I'll be looking for these cords specifically for all my charging needs.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Looks fine;I can't review yet about durability I just bought it. Tho it seems durable.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Junk.  1 was broken, 1 barely charges.;If you want a cord that looks great and is super long, you’ll like this cord...if looks is all you bought it for. If you want to actually work, this is total junk. I bought a two pack of the red 6 foot cords. One didn’t work out of the box, and the other one charged very slow. Within a week, you have to have it in just the right position to work, and it barely charges. It will basically keep my iPad at the same level while it’s charged in and I’m using it. I have to actually put it on airplane mode and put the iPad away in order for it to gain a charge, and it still takes forever.If I could return these I would, but I forgot, and now I’ve missed the return window. The quality of these type of cords on Amazon used to be good, but it seems like 50% of the cords and other electronic accessories I buy on here now are faulty. And since I’m not very good at remembering to return them in time, I’m just wasting my money.If I get one more faulty electronic accessory, I am buying elsewhere. Amazon really needs to do some thing about the sellers of so much junk. No matter the price, it’s not a good deal if it’s a piece of crap.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Cool red;Charging power depends on the adapter it is plugged into...doesn't it?  So why ask that?I like the color!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Very good at charging and long cours except that it gets twisted easily;Decor gets easily twisted and then it kinks up
2.0 out of 5 stars;Decent Cord but Durability is Questionable (1 year after purchase);I was really impressed with this cord but slowly that impressions changed. At first the cords seemed well constructed and worked well However, fairly quickly the cord became twisted and wavy. Recently, about a year after purchase, the cord started to fail. It no longer charges the phone. Well, it charges but now it says it will take 5-15 hours to charge when it used to take a littleover an hour. The second cord was unused and works fine, so it is good that this was a package deal. The product is decent but not a great as I initially thought.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Excellent cable all around.;Very nice cable seems very durable.  I have had 2 for a while now and I haven't had any problems.The only thing of note is that I have a life case and because the plug, on this cable, is larger than a normal cable it goes in a little hard.  This is not a defect and the cable still works with the life case just plugs in hard.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn’t work with iPad pro;I bought it for the iPad Pro. Since the description doesn’t state iPad compatibility, I’m at fault for assuming. Maybe the iPad is picky, but I had a similar cable from another company that worked fine with the iPad.Does work fine charging the Nintendo switch and pro controller, so not a total loss.
5.0 out of 5 stars;It fit my beats;It works.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Durable;"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I use this to charge my A50.Its durable and lengthy. Love this.I can use my phone in bed while charging.Love the length."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Well Constructed!;These work great! Nice length.
4.0 out of 5 stars;work very well and it long;it's a long solid recharging card.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Well Made-Poor Charging;I have been using these cable for charging a Moto G7 Power and Lenovo Chromebook Duet. These are very well made and the length is exactly what I needed. Problem is that these are not 'fast charging'. Not only do my devices tell me that they are experiencing slow charging, but it takes forever to charge my devices compare to the OEM cable.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good cord for the price;works fine when plugged in to wall. Does not seam to charge as well as factory cable when plugged into my battery back up
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great Cables;Very well made and charges fast. So far so good I'm definitely satisfied with the style and quality and the nice tight connection to the phone.
4.0 out of 5 stars;As described, good purchase;Good price,  perfect length,  good quality.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Nice upgrade to the usual;You wouldn't think there'd be a lot of complicated design in charging cables, but the truth is there are little things that count.  The terminals on this set are solid, with rubber cord guards to help keep you from crimping the cable at the ends.  The woven wrap gives the cables enough stiffness to make them manageable, and the vel^H^H^H hook-and-loop closure keeps things from getting tangled in your briefcase.  Plus, everybody knows that red makes things go faster!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Won't stay connected;I've bought from this seller more than once and been very happy, however this time, the USB C adaptor will not stay plugged into my phone and I bought 4 of them. They all have the same problem. The color doesn't matter. Obviously, they have a new manufacturer that is not up to par.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Very slow charging. Disconnects with the slightest movement;I put one in my car and one at my mom's house. The one in my car good up to the Android auto but disconnects easily if the phone is moved at all. The one at my mom's house sometimes charges at 200mAh, sometimes at 800mAh, but never higher. Unfortunately thereturn window has passed so they will be going in the garbage. Don't waste your money. You get what you pay for.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Excellent & heavy duty cables!👍😁;Excellent heavy duty charging cables! Highly recommend!!👍😁
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great charging cord.;Def some good cords. I would still be using them if my phone's port was not dying. Def recomend these if you like the way they look.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Muy bueno;Carga Rapidalargo para cuando estoy acostado y duradero
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great replacement for my original power cord;It's nice to have a  little more length and reinforced ends.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice;They work.
4.0 out of 5 stars;GOOD;ONLY ISSUE I HAVE IT CHARGES SLOW. USED TO CHARGE MY PHONE
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good Value;Fits Galaxy S10. Don't have to remove the case.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Excellent and priced great;"This thing is great. I could tie up an intruder with it if I had to. Plenty long to stop you from having to hold your phone funny or stand right by an outlet. It's sturdy and well made but is a bit stiff and resistant to twist making it want to kink or loop. Very insignificant ""problem"" in the grand scheme though."
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging;"These cords are not fast charging, even with an adaptive fast charging block. I always get a message pop-up saying ""use fast charging cord"" and ""check cord"". They are not worth it."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Charger;Arrived on time, worked as advertised.
5.0 out of 5 stars;wel;Have had it for a bit, it's been functioning very well and long enough for me to play with my phone in bed, so it's a big plus ^ ^ but I think instead of 2 6 feet ones I should get 1 6 feet and 1 10 feet
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not for ipad pro 12.9;I was wondering why my ipad wasn’t charging up when using this cable.  Then I went back and read the entire ad for the cable and found out that it does say that it does not support it.  You have to go way down in the product page to find it.  My fault, but I wish they would put this up front in the description.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Just what I need.;I  like these a lot. They work good and looks good. The packaging looks cool and edgy. Just wish they were a little longer but that's nothing to complain about. All in all good product.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not durable;My wife used this as a charging cable while she lay in bed using her phone. After a few weeks it started acting up. I chalked it up to lint, and cleared out her port. We've tried every trick in the book and this cable simply keeps getting worse. At this point, when you plug it in, the phone registers a spike of charge, then promptly informs you that it's a bad cable with 30+ hrs to a full charge. Jiggling it sometimes gets it to show  <2hrs to full charge for a split second before completely disconnecting. At this point I suspect either the contacts are bad (though rotating it has no effect), or somewhere in the bend there's a break. In any case, I've never had a cable do this to me before unless it's years old.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good;Fast charging
4.0 out of 5 stars;Any cable allows fast charging, but not the power block.;Made of good quality, probably will last for a while. Turns out it was just my power block that needed to be replaced to enable fast charging, not the cables. Will be returning these asap.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast at all.;Could be my phone why they don't charge fast. Ive tried using several plugs including samsung. 4 hrs to charge is not fast enough in this day and age. Might be better on your phone. Phone is Samsung s8.Update, so i got a new phone and it doesn't charge so fast. But what is fast in todays times!? Good well made product though.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Durable and long-lasting;I've had these for over a year now. Best cables ever. They are durable and work well. No breaks, cracks or splits. No faulty wiring or slowing charge. These are excellent and I highly recommend.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Didn't charge my phone in my truck!;The product is durable and seems to charge my phone fine in a wall outlet, but I had it plugged into my truck usb for over an hour and it only went up 1 percent!I tried an older cable I had in the same truck usb port and it charged fine. So it definitely was an issue with that cable in the truck's usb port.  Odd.  So now I just use the cables in the house.  I have a Samsung Galaxy S9 phone.
1.0 out of 5 stars;each usb is 3ft long.;it's advertised as 2 usb at 6ft but you receive 2 usb at 3ft. each.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Affordable, works;Initially when I used, it kept cycling my cellphone to vibrate indicating charging was initiated (but kept doing this once every second for about 40 sec). Then it worked fine. I changed out my wall adapter and it no longer does this. Both wall adapters are reliable. So it may be sensitive to the specific wall adapter you are using, but now works well for me.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast;Not lightning charging fast, I have a store bought one from Walmart and it takes about 20 min less to fully charge,  but I like the thread cord
5.0 out of 5 stars;Well made.;Works well on my Samsung S20FE.  Made well.  Fast charging in home.  In car does not fast charge.  Happy with purchase.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good though not flexible;Fine cable though very stiff and not malleable
4.0 out of 5 stars;Work ok so far;So far works well
4.0 out of 5 stars;Does the job;I'm always suspect of cables/cords made in China, but this one actually works! My phone is back to fast charging to its normal 1.5hrs instead of the 6hrs that it took on a busted charger cord. I've only had it for a week though -- so unsure on its durability. Fingers crossed.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good charging cords;I was leery about this when I ordered it, but I'm glad I did.  Charging seems to be good.  The length is just what I need.  The plug ends aren't fraying like the others I've had.  Seems to be holding up extremely well.  Would recommend them.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Love them!;I didnt know this was 2 chargers for the money. Love them. I needed a new one for the house and the car and was pleased that 2 came. What a great surprise! Durable and are thicker around the connections! Will order again!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Bought Sept 2022, will no longer charge my cell phone.;Bought Sept 2022, will no longer charge my cell phone. Lasted 3.5 months.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not a 2-pack;Great product but it advertised as a two pack and only one came.
4.0 out of 5 stars;La calidad y duración del producto.;Por el momento satisfecha con el producto.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Pretty ok after a few months...;When I first bought these the were great. Not sure about the strength since the broke within a few months...about 5 months. One cord stop working just didn't want to charging anything and the other was lasted long enough till I got a new set. A bit disappointed but they were great. Only if they were able to handle a bit more.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good Cord Length, Not a Turbo Charger;Cord length is as advertised.  Good quality, appears durable.  Cord is not a turbo charger, however.  My phone charges much slower than the turbo charger that came with the device.  The phone display also does not indicate it is turbo charging when plugged up to this cord versus other known turbo charge cords.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't warp charge OnePlus phones;"I have a OnePlus 7 Pro and needed a new cable. I should have read the reviews first. I was hoping this cable would ""warp"" charge my OnePlus since it's advertised as a ""Fast Charging"" cable but it doesn't. It charges normally, which is fine. I'll keep the set since it's a good price and if I need to fast charge, I'll pull out my OEM cable which I wish was longer."
5.0 out of 5 stars;Awesome Phone Charger Cable;The Quality is exceptional very durable, the extra length of the cord and re-enforcements at the edge of the cable is exactly what I need!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good product to have;Like the cord kenght and durability
5.0 out of 5 stars;QUALITY;GOOD PRODUCT
4.0 out of 5 stars;Plug loose in phone;The connection to a Samsung S20 5G phone is not good as the plug is too loose in the socket of the phone. I have to wiggle and press the plug to make contact. C connection.
4.0 out of 5 stars;USB cables;so far so good
5.0 out of 5 stars;Will buy more.;I love it!!! It's durable and comfortable to use. Long enough to not pull on the wire.I bought 4 and I will get more.
4.0 out of 5 stars;They do the job. Great length, medium longevity;Length is fantastic, really like the braiding. They look good and work pretty decently. They don't last the longest, but at that price, you just replace them.
2.0 out of 5 stars;1 of 2 works;Cords seem well made and sturdy, however only 1 works. 50% reliability is not good.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Not bad;Not bad.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good for price;Needs a power port to go with the cords
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect replacement for your OEM;Always been a fan of the OEM accessories, but these lil' guys right here are the perfect replacement for your damaged charger. Fast charge, pretty design, and durable!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good on all points but one.;I feel the USB- C end is a tad short. It sometimes slip out of my Pixel. The construction is very good and it's very durable. Color coded ones make it easier to find amoung many attached to a multiple charger.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Long cord is key;Love the length
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great value;Can't yet comment on the durability of the cords since I have only had them about a month. But for the price and length I paid for the 2 cords they have gotten the job done so far.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charge;Does not fast charge.
5.0 out of 5 stars;A worthy investment.;It does what it is supposed to do, which is to charge my phone. It meets and exceeds expectations.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Very durable cable with great charging power;These are the best fast charging cables I've ever owned.  They have a very durable, heavy duty design.  The length is perfect for me.  Not to long.Not too short. They definitely charge faster than my previous fast charging cables.  I'll definitely buy them again.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Broke after 3 days of use;
5.0 out of 5 stars;This cable works great on my LG G7 Phone.;I got this cable for my LG G7 phone and it works perfectly with the LG fast charge ac adapter. My LG G7 phone was not listed with the phones this cable fits but the LG G7 has a type C connection. The LG fast charge ac adapters I had for my LG G4 are the same as the one for my G7 and work on my G7 using this cable. The six ft. length is also more convenient then the shorter lg cables.
4.0 out of 5 stars;It works.;It works.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Cables feel like they are well design.;I just received this product, so I am not able to give detail review. What I can tell you that it feels that it was well designed and it will last a long time. I love the the read and black colors. It would be a plus if they offer other colors. As of right now, everything is working.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Fast charging power cable;this cable is very durable, it charges super fast even when the cord is wrapped which is good when you don't want to stretch it out to its full length.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great deal;I'm terrible about resting my phone on the charger when it is plugged in and I'm in bed using it. Other cords get kinked as a result but these have not so far. They also rarely tangle and the velcro strip is great for keeping it rolled up when I'm traveling. One of the cords is a little too tight plugging into my phone, so I'm keeping it in case the current one goes out.
4.0 out of 5 stars;👍👍👍;So far, so good!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great Price for the Length;These are a great price for the length of the cord and the fact that you get two cords. They seem like good quality and shipped quickly.
5.0 out of 5 stars;These are Great;I'm glad I ordered these, I'm not replacing older, more flimsy cords with these.  Great length and smooth hook up and unhook abilities.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great Quick Charge Cable;Not only is it a great Quick Charge cable but it is a very rugged design and the different colors help to manage different charging cables easily.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not a steady connection.;Passed return window otherwise would request a replacement.We use these cords in our car for our phones and it's been only 2 months and it seems like the connection is unstable. When using it for Android auto, sometimes it would disconnect which is stressful when we're in a new location or a few miles from an exit.The only quick resolve is to unplug and replug.One usbc port also doesn't seem to have a tight fit and jiggles when plugged into the phone.Update in Dec 2021: now it just doesn't work. -_-
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great cable, son has broke 2 of the non cables, and hoping these last longer;Heavy duty ends hard to break, long lasting cables, fast charging on devices.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Bought for switch but...;It took a really long time to charge a switch.I gave it to my sister who has a phone and tablet with the same port.She tells me the cables are more durable than any others she has had and the length is great and the charge is really good for her devices.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Ok.;First of all, these do not fast charge a Pixel 2XL or a OnePlus 7Pro. Maybe some other phone models will actually fast charge with these cables but from what I understand it takes a specific type of wire inside to do that.They do seem to be well made and the length is why I purchased them.
3.0 out of 5 stars;One of three tables quit working within two weeks of use. I was very disappointed.;One of three tables quit working within two weeks of use. I’m sorry neither I nor my neighbor could find anything wrong with the cord or either end of the cord. The USB connection was fine. There were no kinks cracks or anything else that said you have messed me up. The product just quit working within two weeks of its first use.One cable has been going strong since I received it. The third cable is still working and it replaced the one that quit. I really hope that it keeps on working.
5.0 out of 5 stars;So far so good!;These cords are excellent right out of the box. This is only the first day that I've had them, but both of them charge extremely well and have very well made connections at first glance. I will keep this review updated if they break or show any defects later on.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great value;I love these cables. I bought other charging cables that were very flimsy and frayed in no time but these are made a lot sturdier with rubber reinforcements at the charging end (I will update this review if it doesn't hold up)  They charge my ZTE Axon 7 reasonably fast, and the price was excellent for a 2 pack. The cord length is great and can be shortened if necessary with a velcro strap. I'd highly recommend.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Better than the originals;This is a very good buy. There are two beautiful red strong and long cables in one package. We leave one at work and use the other at home. There is no more searching for a plug. The cord is long enough to reach any and all. Highly recommended product.
3.0 out of 5 stars;No staying power...;The look and feel of these cables are great.  But what they don't seem to do is stay in the USB C socket on the phone.  I don't have this issue with other cables.  Did they build these a bit small to save $$?
4.0 out of 5 stars;Service and quality;I received the cords in a day, great delivery time. One cord works fantastic,  appears to be durable, color cord is easy to locate. The other may be my wall plug, I will change that and update. Very happy with productUpdate, it was the wall plug, both cords work fantastic.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Feels stiff and cheaply made;Not very impressive. Cord is thinner than most, stiff and feels cheaply constructed.  I don't expect it to last very long.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charge;When I plug this cord into my USB port and then into my Chromebook, I get a pop-up message saying that it may not charge while in use. It will basically keep the Chromebook from dying but won't increase the charge level. I was hoping for it to charge while I was working.:(
5.0 out of 5 stars;IT IS EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED;This cable seems to be very strong.  I had my doubts at the beginning but after receiving it I noticed how strong it is.  The color is vibrant.  The endings are well made.  Overall is what I was looking for in a USB cable.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good quality cable;Cable takes an extra push to get in completely on my note 8 , but other than that it's working like a champ. I got 2 longer cables  too
5.0 out of 5 stars;very durable, fast charging, and fast shipping;Sturdy braided cord can withstand trauma from overuse by a teenager.  Ordered on Friday and was in my mailbox by that Monday. Very impressed.  Charges phone quicker than those cords at gas stations and dollar stores.  Best of all, it was a pack of 2 cords
5.0 out of 5 stars;Very durable;This USB cord lasted entire year of daily use. It is just beginning to slow in charging. I purchased 2, one I threw away 2 weeks ago and the other one is going up. Very durable and fast charging.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good product;Like the product
4.0 out of 5 stars;Worth it;Theyre ok. Dont last too oong but theyre a good price.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Su longitud;Hasta el momento estor muy satisfecho con el producto,la longitud del cable y forma de carga y resistencia del cable.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not a fast charge;Was really hoping this would be fast and it's not. Only perk is the super long cord.
3.0 out of 5 stars;They won't fit my phone when it has the case on.;These are super cool charging cables but they are so thick on the end I had to buy an adapter to make them fit my phone because it won't fit it while the case is on, and I'm not taking my case off!!Other than that I really like them, they are fast charging and very well made!!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Cord does not stay in phone;Very dissatisfaction. Charger does not stay in phone, continously falls out.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Cable c;there are ok for extra especial if you have guest
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good cord;Works great charges fast and is long enough you can lay in bed and still use the phone while its charging. You even get 2 of them
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great product;This is my second box because everyone wants to use my cords fast charge and long enough for me 2 come in the box and my first pair lasted over 1 year
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not for s21 Ultra.;I bought a 2 pack of the blue cords. Works exactly as it should and they are built well. But, they are not compatible between a S21Ultra and android auto. Everything else works. Worked fine with my S9 in every aspect.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Long, rugged, but may not work for everyone;Works great on my s9, doesn't work on my spouses s8- we think it's something about how tight the connection is. Cord length is great and durability seems good. One note is that the more rugged USB c plug is a bit fatter than standard, so may be too big for the port on some phone cases
3.0 out of 5 stars;It doesn't fast charge on my S10+;The product durability and feel is great, I love it. The problem is it doesn't fast charge like it promises. It takes 2 and a half hours to charge... I've tried switching wall plugs and it doesn't change anything. Honestly disappointed
5.0 out of 5 stars;WOW Exceeds expectations;I am blown away. Thought I was getting 1 cord and I have 2. I bought it to go in my car. I have my original for my note 9 wall charger at home. Now that I have 2 cords I will keep 1 at work. Also impressed with the quality of the cable and the packaging. Will order from them again. Hopefully it lasts as good and heavy as it feels.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't fast charge S20 in car.;Bought this for my car hoping that it would fast charge my phone (samsung S20). Unfortunately it only charges my phone at a normal pace. Better than slow charging of course, but was still hoping for a fast charge. Nice quality for the price.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great buy;I've used them for over a year now and they still work great.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Type C;They work. The red color is good for  knowing which cable it is. Durability is to soon to say. We hope they last for years.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Long lasting design;What a wonderful cable. It looks like it'll last forever. I thought I was getting only one, but it was actually two in a package, nice surprise!  It seems to charge well, no issues here! 👍
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging..;The have strong ends and seem durable. They don't allow for fast charging and charge gets slower with age. The are average to above average, they aren't greatUpdate Jan 2023, these are all done. Have to move ends around to get them to work. All the beefy looks and hype are just hype. These are average cables with pretty hardware.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Better than I thought they would be.;I use this cable on and off during the week to charge a tablet and I put it through some stress.  No problems at all.  Nice and strong and they look good too.  I love the extra length.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good Quality for the Price;Both cords worked fine out of the box, They are a little stiff, not as flexible or polished as an Anker cord. Strain relief looks really robust. I expect these to last. I didn't want to spend a fortune knowing that usb-c will eventually be obsolete like all the other cord tips.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Phn charging cords;Work perfectly perfect length
5.0 out of 5 stars;Excellent!;I have to say, this is the 2nd time ordering.  For less than 10 bucks you get 2 of these cords,  my last one lasted almost an entire year before breaking,  even then it still charged just slowly.  This cord latest longer than any other cord I've tried,  and cheaper to boot.  Definitely recommend!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Red USB-C cables.;A long braided red USB C cable. I don't know about the durability as it hasn't been years. It works and charges. I chose red for as I have many black and silver color cables. The red will help to find in a travel bag.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Loose connection;My only complaint is the cord just falls off my phone without warning. The c end just pops right off all the time. It's very annoying! Other than that very nice cords!
3.0 out of 5 stars;One came broken;One of the chargers already had issues at the USB connector right out of the box. Only works at a certain angle, so you have to keep your phone in one place or risk it not charging. The 2nd one works fine.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Okay but not the best charger cord 🤔;The cord is very durable, however it takes a long time to charge my iPad Pro but when I plug my iPad into the apple charger it charges up much faster. It works okay charging my Samsung Note again not as great as the manufacturers own charger.So if you aren't in a hurry to charge up your phone this charger cord will work in a crunch.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great Charger;The charger is great, compared to the cheap  charger you can buy at a convenient store that will die out in a month or two this for sure is worth the buy. Plus the length of the wire is great comes in handy.
3.0 out of 5 stars;These charging cords don't charge any better than the ones I already have;These charging cords don't charge any better than the ones I already had
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great charging cable;I really like this charging cable.  It cut my charging time by at least half.
4.0 out of 5 stars;great connection;love it. Charges phone very fast.Bought for durability. I fear it might not last as long as I'm hoping, but it's much better than my last one. So verdict isn't totally out yet.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Quality Cables;Been using these for several months and they are still working great.  These are quality cables for the budget.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect lengths;Perfect for where I needed to charge my phone most.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Super reliable.;I use this at work and also at home. It charges super fast and it is super efficient. Definitely would recommend for smartphone users in any circumstances.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Fat end;Works fine.  The end of it is kinda fat though and may interfere with the case on your phone.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Prefect length;I love how long the cord is and it never really tangles with others. I love how when I'm charging my phone and have it on my chest the cord can handle it. Sometimes it says that the charging is not compatible but that could be the block I use but overall I love it!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Not tested yet;Gift
2.0 out of 5 stars;You get what you pay for;"Only upside to this charger is that it's long and you get 2 for less than $10. It took almost 2 hours for my phone to charge. My phone doesn't have issues in charging, my old charger ripped and that's why I got this one. Even with my ""Fast Charge"" adapter, this cable is charging slow. It does state that it is ""Fast Charging"" but it isn't. I'm at 70% now and it's saying it will take 45 minutes for full charge....that is literally the amount of time it took to fully charge my phone with my old cable and I would start charging it once my phone reached 5%."
2.0 out of 5 stars;Weak charging;I've been using these for two weeks. I only used the cord to charge my galaxy note 20It feels durable.I like the color.The charge is weak and slow.I plugged these cords into a wall charger plug, I used them in a USB dedicated outlet (Power strip), plugged into my car stereo, and a car charger plugged into my cigarette outlet. My phone didn't die while being charged. So, I guess that's cool. Getting my phone to 100 percent took about 2 to 3 hours. I am not impressed. I wasted my money.
5.0 out of 5 stars;That it works;Like the blue color n the fast charging.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Fast charging and very durable!;This is actually my second time purchasing this duo pack of charging cords. I've had the first set for over a year now and they still charge my phone very rapidly.  The cord length and sturdiness is also very good, no kinks, shreds, wires poking out or damaged ends. Also love the color.  I highly recommend this charging cord.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Nice length;I like a cord long enough to allow me to check messages, emails during the night. This one does that.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good product;Convenient, Durable and Useful
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good Charger;Charges great. Only problem is that it doesn't fit with my phone case on. I have the take the case off to use it. The charger that came with the galaxy 10 does not have that problem.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Dynamic Duo;These cords look like they are worth 5 times as much. Amazing quality, with a tiny velcro strap to keep them together... This is a win win!!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great Value;I was not expecting a pair to arrive but turned out I was able to gift one of them. The length of the core is just want I wanted. However, the charge is pretty slow. I charge my phone at night while in bed so I dont have a big problem with being a slow charger. Typically will take 1.5 hours to fully charge.  Still a great value though.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Connection a bit loose;This cable works fine for charging my phone.  But if I'm holding my phone while it's charging the cable easily slips out of the USB-C port on my phone.  My other USB-C cords stay in more securely. This one works fine if I don't move the phone.  It's just doesn't seat in the USB-C port as tight as it should.  Other than that it's fine and I still use it.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Quick charge.;Used to charge my Samsung phone and it charged quickly. The cord is long enough that I don’t have to worry about pulling it out of the socket.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Well worth the money!!;Good chargers! Lasted along time!! Still working!! Well worth the money!!  Works better than the fake Apple chargers! Works just as well as the  android chargers that come with the android phones
4.0 out of 5 stars;This is a very good charging cord and it doesn't get kinked up!;If this cord is compatible with your phone, get it for sure.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging;Doesn't activate fast charging for my one plus phone, but it is a good long usb cord.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Seems to be well made;Seems to be a good quality product and I think it’s worth the price. Only time will tell how it holds up
2.0 out of 5 stars;Don't last;These were great at first. I have already had to replace them and I only used them 5 months.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good charger for Galaxy S9;This charger fit perfectly into my Galaxy S9 and charges quickly.  I've only had it for a couple of weeks so I can't speak to its durability.  The long length is great.  So far I like it much better than the cord the phone came with.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great cord;Nice replacement
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good for Data, Slow for Charging;Cable works fine for transferring pictures, but after trying it in a couple different chargers and comparing to other cables it doesn't seem to charge very fast, sometimes taking an hour longer than using the other cables i have. It's a good backup to have just not great to keeping my phone topped off throughout the day.
4.0 out of 5 stars;That is will last;Durability is what I wanted
1.0 out of 5 stars;After your 1st use you can use it as a jump rope to do your cardio workout. I did 🤣;"Love:1). The color Red2). The cord length3). Two, (in my opinion, useless), cables came in the box4). Works great for a cardio ""Jump rope"" workout5). Possibly, (if it heats up like it does on my NOTE 9 & MOTO Z⁴PLAY), Use it to charge an old phone at under a pile of wood-- possibly start a bonfire if not an explosion ORHATE:1). Over heated both my SAMSUNG NOTE 9 and my MOTO Z⁴ PLAY phones to the point: (A).I was afraid the batteries were going to explode.(B). My screen had horizontal lines going through it and the screen flickering to black2). The cable itself gets hot (but not as hot as my phones)3). It's NOT fast charging like it claims.4). Waisted my money on this unsafe cable5). Waisted my time by ordering it and the time to figure out it made great use as a jump rope.6). Waisted AMAZON's time by even putting this on their site to sell this junky poc• Gives at an honest statement when someone says: ""It's a ""burner phone""• Under FBI investigation? Could be better than smashing it w a sledge hammer.I'm not brave enough to keep charging and leave the room or on my phone for more than 5 minutes. I'm not even brave enough to plug it in to the outlet.As usual, I should have heeded the numerous other 1⭐ reviews"
5.0 out of 5 stars;Ok it's actually great;After finding out my phone was crap, I used this on my new phone and it is magnificent.  5 star
5.0 out of 5 stars;A good cord with the lenght you sometimes need;Needed a new cord for my Samsung Galaxy.  I now use one in the house and one in my truck. It has been nice to have the extra length jn the house but it can be a little long in the truck. It dones come with a way to tie it back to shorten it.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Best Bang 4 The Buck;Well these are certainly the best bang for the buck. The quality of these chords is really quite impressive.  You simply can't go wrong with these.  The company even has @Support!!! For charge chords that's amazing in itself
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice and durable;Like the feel and durability of this item. Only had it for about a week or so and I am very happy with it thus far. Curious to see how long it last compare to all the others that last 6 months or so before they bend, stop charging or just fall apart
4.0 out of 5 stars;Sony Xperia 10 plus : ideal...;This cable has HDMI cable quality standards at plain site. the cable is very particular but seems to work just as good, if not better , than the manufacturer cable. I don't think this cable will come apart in any way. a good buy.
4.0 out of 5 stars;These are Great!;I use these cables for the USB phone setup on my bike and they're brilliant. By virtue of the protective sheath that surrounds the wiring they're fine in the warm FL sun and no issues (so far) on days when I get caught riding in the rain. Just what I was looking for.
5.0 out of 5 stars;All around great charging cord;This is a very durable cord. Great length for my needs. I have them in every room.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great cable.  Well made;This cable seems strong and well made.  The 18 month replacement warranty is a major selling point.
3.0 out of 5 stars;It shortages but, still good nontheless;Came in as expected, very durable and long! Thing is I noticed something with the charger. My charger usually shorts out for a few minutes (Charging and then not charging repeatedly) and after a few minutes of doing it, it charges normally. If I ignore that flaw this charger is crazy fast you will usually get 10% charged up in a few minutes and that's crazy. Plus it's durable and everything. Very good charger! Might update this if something does happen with the charger since it does have a slight problem.
3.0 out of 5 stars;3A....it is NOT FAST CHARGING;I did not realize the 3A was significant. and it is...it is a SLOW CHARGING cord.  If you want a charger that charges quickly or while you are using the device do NOT buy this.  Cord length-great  Durability-great  Charging ability-2 thumbs down.  3A is useless on anything higher than 6th generation.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't fit!;The charger works fine but it doesn't fit my case. The part surrounding the type c plug is too big so I have to take the case off for it to work which is annoying. Can't speak for durability yet. I may just get another brand that actually works with my case.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Sturdy so far;I got one for work and one for home and they have been good and sturdy so far. I like that the cable is a little thicker and seems more likely to take survive the random getting caught up in an office chair.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Well made;Connections are snug and fit well. FYI, the Velcro strap sticks to everything around it.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Cable Stiff;Connectors firm fit. The cable is a bit stiff so I don't know about Durability yet.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works good;Simple, got these two cords to replace older cords that were worn. They hold tight in the port and work good with quick charge
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great cords;Awesome product
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works well but loose;It's a little loose on the port where it plugs into the phone . Other than that it seems to be working just fine.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Solid;Solid, solid, solid, this cable is good looking and sturdy, i was thinking to buy one at Best Buy for $8.99 but this one is longer and comes with two.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good quality cables;"Just received these cables a couple of weeks ago but they seem sturdy.  They work with Samsung's Fast Charge capabilities so that's good.  I can't provide feedback regarding ""durability"" but I don't have doubt that they will last a while."
3.0 out of 5 stars;Definitely not fast charging;Definitely not fast charging. I bought these specifically for that purpose and it was a huge let down especially since I bought several packs for work and home. The length and style were accurate though
4.0 out of 5 stars;USB Cords...;These cords give a lot of length and are very durable, and do charge quickly.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good value;Good seller
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works great unless plugged directly into a car;Works great as long as you are using a charging box! If that is the way you charge these will work and are worth the price. If you want a cord that plugs directly into your car, slow charging and doesn't work well.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works well;Love it. I have one for the car and my room.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Happy with my purchase and the price!!;I love my new cords. I can charge my phone while I'm in bed or working in my bed on my laptop. The cords are long and bends. I am very happy with the quality!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Works as advertised;This item works but it seems to be shakey as it doesn't seem to go deep enough into my phone. Better cords seem to click in place. For the price I'm not totally dissatisfied.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Heavy duty;The cord is durable and well built. It is kind of stiff and the sub C connector is thicker and did not fit through my phone's cover. I had to whittle out the plastic case so the reinforced end would fit into the charging port.
5.0 out of 5 stars;1st usb C device...;"Latest phone purchase took me into the USB C realm.  Standard packaging included a ""joke"" of a power connector.  These are awesome!  Ordered 2 packs so there would be one in my office, living room, car... everywhere I'd need to power up & they do nothing they increase the charge speed of my already super fast 30 watt fast charge!!!"
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice sturdy charging cable;So far, the cable and connectors appear to be very sturdy, unlike other charging cables we've purchased.  We're hoping this means they will hold up well.  The velcro strap is a nice touch to keep them tidy when traveling.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Old purchase from this listing was fast charging, this one (Dec 2022) is not fast charging;I've purchased this product before.  Great cables.  Purchased from same listing again (different color) this month and got cables that dont fast charge.  Same devices, same plugs, old cables still work fine.  New cables don't.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Well worth it!;Extremely quick charging. Great length andseems very durable.  Great quality and great price
5.0 out of 5 stars;Two thumbs up;Both ends off the plug fits snuggly into the slots. Activates my turbo charge on my phone. Very pleased with this product and it's durability.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Corrected review;I have an LG6 and at first I thought these cables did not support fast charging. Turns out that other cables didn't either. The issue turned out to be software amazingly, a later update to the Android supplied by LG fixed the fast charging issue.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Baja la velocidad de carga;buen material pero baja el nivel de carga y su velocidad i
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works as well as the one that came w phone!;I bought these extra cords along with plugs to place in a couple of areas in the house so I would not have to depend on just one cord!  They arrived as stated, I liked the red, and they work as well as the one that came with my Note 10!  I'm very pleased with my order!  Thank you!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Fast charging!!!;No dislikes!!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great size and function and you get 2;I ordered these for a Galaxy S9 and they work perfectly. The cord is substantial in strength and in length. It is nice to get 2, so I replaced my car charger and home charger with these. Easy to differentiate from other cords in the drawer too and the extra length allows for more options for charging sites. Really good so far.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Will buy for all family members;Love the length
5.0 out of 5 stars;Cell Phone Charger cables;It was time for an upgrade. I like the quality and price of the item.I will order them again. A+
5.0 out of 5 stars;Well made;Product appears to be well made.Nice to get a braded charging cord with extra length at this price.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Durable and convenient;If you need a type c charger these are reliable and affordable.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Needed tough heavy duty cords, these fit the bill;Purchased for friend who is rough with cords. This should last a while heavy duty construction. Friend is happy with durability of units.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good Replacement Cord;The charging cord for my Samsung phone became terribly frayed. I thought I would have to replace the phone. This cord is flexible and durable and saved me from buying  new phone
5.0 out of 5 stars;Fits and works well;The cord feels solid and the connections fit nice.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good value;The cable appears to be built with good materials. I’ve been using it to charge my earbuds and it has been great. As comes with an attached strap for cord management
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not Fast Charging;It is not a fast charging cable. I tried it in both my oneplus 7 pro and pixel 3 xl with 3 different bricks that fast charge with an original wire, but it doesn't fast charge. It still gets the job done for overnight charging but it won't keep up with out of the box chargers.
3.0 out of 5 stars;After one year, one went bad;Bought a two pack, one did go bad. Not completely, but it depends how I position it. This happened after more than a year of daily use so I won't gripe too much but it should be better than 50/50 at the year mark.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Fulfills its claims;I have a cable in both our cars, one at my desk at home and one that I carry from living room to bed room. The cables are very durable, and do charge the phone quickly!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Almost as good as OEM for Pixel 3;"Initial impression was good, cable length of 6ft is good and overall quality is decent out of the box. This clicks into Pixel 3 securely and doesn't wiggle when plugged in. My main gripe is these were advertised as being adaptive fast charging capable and they are slower than OEM charging cables for my pixel. When I plugged it in, my phone said ""charging slowly"". I used a amperage app and several plug in and cable combos to compare this project to others. The best I could get with this cable was 1200 mA. The typical reading with my OEM pixel cable was 1470mA. So is it that far off, no. However for the price, I expect better performance..."
4.0 out of 5 stars;works good with Android Auto;Good and lengthy cable
4.0 out of 5 stars;So Far so good;Love the fact they are long and colored so easy to tell which one goes to which device.  Had some from another company that only lasted about 6 months.  SO I am hoping these will last much longer.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great seller and amazing product.;It was just what I needed for the recliner.  My dad needed one as well and at 80 he needed durable.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works;I mean it is a charger. Not sure what you should expect. It plugs in, it charges, and it is red. Yay cool.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Looks stronger better constructed. TEEN PROOF?!?;Hopefully it will last longer than other chargers we have used! Seems stronger at the phone connection than other chargers we had. Very innovative cording that surrounds the long lengthy cord👍!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Durable;Worked wonderfully for 1.5 years. Way longer than most phone charger cords in my home.
5.0 out of 5 stars;ITS A CABLE. ITS RED. IT WORKS;What more can I say.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Booooooooo;Takes like 3 hours to charge my galaxy phone half way these stink
4.0 out of 5 stars;great quality;NEVER SKIMP ON CABLES
4.0 out of 5 stars;One out of Two work;Got my package fairly quick but within 4 days after receiving the Charger cords. I have one and the other was given to my gf well mine works fine her shorted out
2.0 out of 5 stars;Wrong cord;The extension cord was wrong. My mistake obviously.  The other things work great.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Solid product,better than expected.;This is a high quality product. Made of what seems to be good materials. Good looking bright colors makes it easy to see in the tangle of cords for my other devices.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works ok;Started smoking and burning after a few weeks of usage.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good but has a few issues;Good cord but I do notice a few things. If you have a newer MacBook Air with the two ports, this cord only charges using the top port. Also, it does take a little while for the charging to actually begin. As opposed to apples standard charging cable.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice durable cord.;Charging Cell
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great cord- picture is a bit deceiving. There is no blue light on either side of the cord.;Charger cord works as intended
4.0 out of 5 stars;good cable;good cable
4.0 out of 5 stars;OK so far;Cord length was main feature.  Seems sturdy
3.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't play nice with Nokia devices.;All around these are great cords, but the lack of being able to play nice with Nokia devices is unfortunate because that is one of the reasons we bought the cords. Wife needed a new charging cable for her phone.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great length!;The length and durability of the charging cord is why I bought them and I haven't been disappointed. Cord stays in the phone and in the adapter with no issues.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good but not the best;Good charger but not fast charging
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works well for the most part;"Had another one like this one. Got to where it always said ""slow charging"".  I do like the length though."
4.0 out of 5 stars;2 cords plus durability that’s a good deal.;I am so happy with these cords. Charge fast & durable especially when my tablet fell & it still fit tight. I would highly recommend this cord. 👍🏼😃
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast enough charging;As compared to my original cable that came with One plus 6t , this cable is not charging my phone or any other devices that use  Type C port fast enough. But the cable is lengthy and strudy and seems to be of a Good build. It's ok for a price point of that level.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Cable 10' for s20 phone;Perfect length, I needed a long cable in my office for I was always pulling the old one of the socket.  Great product looks better than the plain black of white I previously had.
3.0 out of 5 stars;not strong as I thought;not strong as I thought, other than that it was good for a few months
4.0 out of 5 stars;Very nice;I just purchased these 2 weeks ago so I can't comment on durability but these are fantastic and look as if they will last a long time.
5.0 out of 5 stars;THIS WAS AN AWESOME PURCHASE!;Love the length of the cordCharges really fastThe cord is flexible
5.0 out of 5 stars;Strong;Works well and I don't think my cat will be chewing thru it.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great quality cables - no more breaks at the connector.;I've gone through tons of charging cables.  They all break where the wire meets the plug.  But not these.  Very durable cable, and a good 8 months in they're still like new, no breaks.  Like these so much I bought more for my car, camper, etc.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Cord review;Work great. Seem durable.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great Chargers.;These chargers are great for my s9, have no issues, with them definitely a great replacement. I really love the length to, no having to be confined to 2 to 3 feet can sit comfortably and use phone while it's charging.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Really is a great charger!;Very thick and sturdy!! Nice length too! Love that it comes with two. I gave one to my sister.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Three Stars;Not a fast charger, but was only purchased as a replacement for car/ work charger that broke.....I was here a few minutes ago so this is an update it charges fast as long as you aren't using the phone while it charges. I put it down 20 minutes ago it was at 36% now in 20 minutes it's at 60%
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works great;Got for my dad. Love the length and made well .even one in my family has one now.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Two out of 3 stopped working in less than 6 months;The cords look really nice, but one stopped working after 3 months and the other after about 5 months. So out of the 3 cords that I purchased, I only have 1 that works, and I bought these less than 6 months ago. I would recommend purchasing a different brand or a brand with a longer warranty - this one was guaranteed for 90 days, and the first one stopped working after about 95 days... For context, other cords plugged into the same outlets are still working, and there was no unusual wear and tear, so there is no reason that these cords should have stopped working.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Quality Construction;These are good, well-built high-quality cables. The housing, connectors and strain reliefs are all first-rate. I have a few different nylon-braided cables like this one, and really they're all great. These are just as good as any nylon-braided cables I've used. Bear in mind that this cable, like most nylon-braided cables, are a little stiff - the focus of the cable design is on durability - flexibility not so much.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works fine most of the time.;Sometimes while charging I will get a message that it is charging slower than what is being used. Most of the time it works fine.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Awful;Very slow charging and my phone starts heating while using this charger
5.0 out of 5 stars;Awesome purchase;Love that it is just as it was advertised.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good cable for the price;I had to buy this cable for my beats flex wireless headphones. Works great.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Reliable fast charging;Fast chargingLong cord
4.0 out of 5 stars;USB TYPE C CABLE PHONE CHARGER;It works well, but my freaking pixel 2 doesn't charger fast with this.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Make sure to get the one made for your devise!;Wrong size,so can't say how well it would work
3.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charge;Very slow charge compare with the original cable that came with my phone
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great Charging;It charges great with protection support on each end of the ports. However without a adapter that meets performance with the charger I am left stranded having to wait 3 hours for my phone to charge. Any suggestions?
5.0 out of 5 stars;Just the best! So happy I got these!;As advertised! I got two for the price of one? How can I complain? Plus the cords are VERY strong and durable, my cat can't chew through them. She's chewed through them all! The length allows me to do stuff WHILE my phone charges, and I don't have to sit close to the wall. Amazing buy, great job guys, thank you!!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect;Last a long time
4.0 out of 5 stars;👌;👌
4.0 out of 5 stars;Phone charges well/charger quit working;My phone was charged quickly and completely. I received two chargers...one quit working altogether within 7 days. This left me one charger.....it is still working fine and a month has gone by.....
4.0 out of 5 stars;they work;I have noticed that after a couple weeks, the connection to my phone started to come loose. I don't have that problem with the original cable for it, but as long as you stick the cable in and don't move it around too much, it works just fine.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Cable works;Using it to charge phone in while in the car.  Appears to work.  Cable is a little stiff for this application.
5.0 out of 5 stars;I liked them so much I bought 2 more sets!;I really like these cables. They fit into my S8+ perfectly. They are very well made and very sturdy. I'm an electrician and I wanted a longer cable for my work truck and one to keep in my tool bag in case I need to recharge my phone on the go. These are are great and for the price they are a steal. As soon as I got them from Amazon I ordered another set. Buy them you won't be sorry.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good for backup but not replacement;This is definitely not fast charging as stated in Ad which concerns me about messing up on my phone's ability to keep charge after prolonged use of cable. I only use for rare occasions or backups.
5.0 out of 5 stars;The length was just what I needed.;I received them quickly and they work great. I was so happy with the length.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Was great until it wasn't.;I have been using the same cable for multiple devices a while now. The cable is a bit too long but that okay for the most part, its a bit stiff after a few months. A device I've charged hundreds of times before  was charging, when I accidentally touched the plug of the cable, it was searing hot. The end of the cable melted to the device and it probably would have melted its insulation and caught fire if I didn't catch it.
4.0 out of 5 stars;👍🏽;So far so good.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Better then my actual phone charging cable;Its really good product. I really like it.. but the only problem is when I connect this cable with my motorcycle charger it it's really bad.. but I guess it's not ment for tht. Otherwise it's better then the cale i got with my phone doesn't make my phone hot while I'm charging it.
4.0 out of 5 stars;I wish they both still worked great, had to drop a star;Very high quality cords, but one of them was a dud for me. They both worked perfectly for the first couple days, then one dropped down to slow-charging (way less than regular charge speed). The second one works perfectly well. I wish they both still worked great, had to drop a star.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging;These are not fast chargers. Every time I plug a phone in I get a slow charging message. If you're not using your phone and you have it plugged in for a couple hours you'll have a fully charged phone. If you use your phone while it's charging, you pretty much just tread water. I play movies, tv shows through Bluetooth headphones while I'm sleeping and my phone is charging. Last night I plugged my phone in with 28%power, 8 hours later I was at 53%. For reference, I have a S21+.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Absolutely amazing!!;"Absolutely amazing!!! Don't let the low price fool you, very high quality product!!! Compared to the high price, and I mean high priced, one for my Google pixel, it is by far superior! Quick example, the wall charger shows it ""charging rapidly"" where as car one shows it as just charging with almost triple the time to full charge. This one plugged into any wall or auto usb chargers, does as should and charges rapidly! Have bought 2 so far and ordering more!"
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works;Works great! Actually worked with my fast charging block with some great distance.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great product!;Product arrived on time and is just as advertised! Great cord length and durability.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Does the job;Great charging cable replacement. Very durable, extra length is a plus! Definitely recommend.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped working after 6 months;Bought 2 cables they stopped being effective after about 6 months.
4.0 out of 5 stars;NOT FOR LIFE PROOF CASES;DOES NOT WORK WITH LIFEPROOF CASES. The hub is too big to fit into the opening rendering the cord USELESS. Now I have 2 cords I can't use.If you don't have this kind of case... it's a sturdy, well made cord and worth the purchase.
4.0 out of 5 stars;This cord is durable and well worth the price;"I am happy with my purchase and would definitely buy this item again.  My one complaint is that ""sometimes"" it does not feel as if I am getting a fast charge.  This is sporadic and does not deter me from promoting this product."
1.0 out of 5 stars;Drains doesn't charge;I got these for my daughter.  When plugged in it keeps reconnecting and it actually drains the power. Watched as the percent goes down rather than up while charging.  Returned.
4.0 out of 5 stars;worth the money;Excellent product, works well, very much worth the money
3.0 out of 5 stars;Make sure you order the right port size;Gave you my friend ,worked great  for him
5.0 out of 5 stars;Charging power;Great cord
4.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect.. Just what I needed;So glad I purchased these cables for my android Galaxy  8+ phone.  So much longer and usable and works great with my Fast Charger.  The shorter one that came with my phone doesn't allow me much room to use my phone while it is charging.  Great purchase!!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good deal for the price;Great durable fast charging cord. The reason that I deducted 1 star is because the head is large and hard to fit when you have a case on your phone.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Very good;The cord length is brilliant and mu cat has jet to chew through it.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Wire doesn't fit Galaxy S9 or S10 with Ghostek case;I have a Galaxy S9 and my wife has a Galaxy S10 . We bought this to charge our phones and found the wire does not fit. Both of our phones have Ghostek cases so I'm assuming it's a compatibility issue between the wire and the case - but I've used several different USB C wires with these phones and never ran into this issue . We are keeping the wires because they do work with our Nintendo Switch but we are still disappointed with the compatibility issue .
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not durable.;Seems like a good cord just doesn't last very long. Came as a two pack and both broke in a just about 1 month time. Maybe it was just a lemon package I got? First one stopped charging the first day and the second one just stopped working today after using it for a month. I just ordered another set because they are cheaper than the ones from Walmart. Maybe it was just a fluke? Walmart cords I usually get 3-6 months out of at maybe $20 a cord so 4x the price of these. Hopefully this set will go a lil longer.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good;Cord length is great but charging time is bit slow
5.0 out of 5 stars;Nice looking cables at a great length.;I love the look of these cables and the length is perfect. I have one in my car and one at home. It's great that I can use my phone in bed while it's charging without having to bend over or whatever to be able to reach it. Seems very durable and I assume this is robust enough to withstand my cats!!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great quality highly recommend.;I purchased these for myself and for family . Great idea for stocking stuffers. Used them on several different model phones , including the Samsung note 9 and Samsung 10 series and Motorola fast charge phones. Never have gotten a warning on the phone about OEM equipment.  These things work very well
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great phone cord;I love the color. The length of the cord is perfect. I have plenty of room to use my phone while its plugged in. I haven't used it that long so I'm not 100% on the durability but it seems good quality.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Work, but not fast chargers;This work is regular charges. They are not fast Chargers. I use them, however had to buy more that were fast charging. They do work though, and the length is convenient.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Don't really fast charge;Since I got this charger, about a week now it doesn't really fast charge! It fast charged for a few minutes then you have to plug it out and turn it around and plug it back in and constantly do that.Very annoying it doesn't stay at fast charging for my lgv20 and this battery is fearly new
5.0 out of 5 stars;Purchase THESE!  BEST FOR THE 💰.;I have purchased these for myself, and others.  Absolute best for the money.  Best at any price. Without question.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Fast Charging;This must be a fast charging cable for an S8 but not for a S10. My phone is at 87% and it says it will charge in 45 minutes. The cable that came with the phone will charge it in 18 minutes.
1.0 out of 5 stars;doesn't stay connected;just got this product and while i love the build, look, length, and price....I do not recommend it. each time i am using the charger, it constantly says it's not connected and then will suddenly connect, maybe for 15 minutes, then stop charging and disconnect. it's frustrating as hell, and despite reaching out to the manufacturer, they failed to respond -- thus my 1-star.Look elsewhere, buy elsewhere.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Didn't do what I needed it to do;I bought it to connect my phone to Android Auto in my car, but it didn't work at all for that even though it is the right type of cable. I went to the dealer and they said to buy a cord from the same company that makes the phone.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Get This Not The Others;This is cord is amazing not just because it is BLUE, but because it feels durable, the length is perfect for most of my everyday needs like being able to reach when I change the height of my standup desk. The dogs haven't got to it yet, and nothing unexpected has happened, but when they do I shall adjust the review accordingly.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Durability in 2 weeks???.... so it lasted about 2 years;Hope it doesn't fray!!It only been couple of weeksAsk me in a years time to review againLasted about 2 years ... just bought new ones
3.0 out of 5 stars;It worked;"It's a charging cable,  I only rated it 3 stars because it performed its task.  It does not deserve 4 or 5 stars because I reserve that rating for things that really exceed my expectations.  I  don't really know how a charging cable can exceed my expectations however.  So it is an average product and deserves an average rating.The question these companies have to ask themselves is "" which is better, a 3 star rating or no rating at all""  When you send me emails asking me to review your product, that is the risk you take."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works Great, Long Cord;The cables work great and you get two! They are a little longer than I was thinking. However I can make due. I also like the velcro tie that is attached, makes it very convenient for storage. I would recommend.
4.0 out of 5 stars;It's the charging cable I've seen. The length and construction are second to none.;I absolutely like everything about this charging cord. The length of the cord, charging speed and even the color and construction of it.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Work fine;Work just like you'd expect
3.0 out of 5 stars;Does the job. Length is convenient and doesn't get tangled;It does the job. Amazing that it doesn't get tangles. It is not as fast as the original cable when I use it to charge my mobile. Not sure about durability but so far it has been 2 months and it works the same.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Looks good but not what I needed;Looks good and it seems durable, but I was searching for an iPhone cable and within the search, this was mixed in with the results. Sooo I ordered this due to its price and it’s not what I needed or searched for.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfection.;This is how all charging cables should be made.
3.0 out of 5 stars;not fast charging;it did not work as a fast charging cable.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Too Long for automobile use;Vert nice cables, way too long for automobile use.  Wished I'd bought a shorter length.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Waterproof case users, read below;Great product, well made and I like the the leather cord wraps.  Only difficulty was that the plug was too big for my waterproof case. Certainly not the fault of the manufacturer in any way, but, if your case has a small opening,  these are not for you!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works good;Great product works well with my new iPad. I’m just not a fan when sellers send me multiple emails being pushy for me to leave a review. Let me take my time and I’ll review promptly or I would have left five stars.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great;Purchased for my LG stylo 4 when my kitten chewed up my original cord. I love the length on these, I'm able to hide the cord from inquisitive kitties and toddlers yet still charge my phone. My oldest has figured out these also charger her Simbans Picassotab. Ive lost it to her a few times already.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Don't last;Liked them but they quit charging fast so there not dependable quit a waste
4.0 out of 5 stars;AS EXPECTED;I really like the length of cord and flexibility of the cord.
4.0 out of 5 stars;"""feel"" very strong/durable. Wiil rate after 6 months use.";Length. Too soon to rate durability. Using 1 several times day. Saving other ad replacement.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Well constructed;Nice and strong cable.  Love the longer reach.
4.0 out of 5 stars;It works.;I bought this charging cable as an extra to keep at my workplace. It's heavy duty, sturdy and has a nice vibrant red color. Can't miss it. The only downside is its length. It takes up way more space than it should at my desk.
4.0 out of 5 stars;usb charger;I guess one of the two was damage the second one works better
4.0 out of 5 stars;I have found nothing to dislike;I have found nothing to dislike. High quality built cable, I purchased a two pack and if they keep up the quality I will buy again.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Solid!;I travel a lot, so cord length is important as well as function. Six feet gives me plenty of security for wherever I need to reach. The construction appears rugged. I've not had an issueThe charging is also fast. My phones are back to full power in about the same speed as the original equipment. I like it!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Durable;I love the reinforcement on the ends and the braided write is a must have for all chargers. It charges my Galaxy Note 8 and my husband's Galaxy S20 perfectly.
5.0 out of 5 stars;10/10 Charger;This charger has lasted me a very long time, my chargers never last and always get snagged, I had my first pair for about a year and I even bought some for my family.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Length is Great;Hospital stay and color and length is wonderful
5.0 out of 5 stars;Fast charge;I have purchased several of these. They work great and charge my phone fast.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Best Value for My Money;This product works great!  Very sturdy. The length is perfect. Love it!
3.0 out of 5 stars;This probably isn’t what you want;You’re almost certainly ordering the wrong cable like I did. I had a few cocktails. Do you really need USB-C to USB? Are you sure you don’t need USB-C to lightning? Are you also looking to hook up a VCR to a 4K tv?
5.0 out of 5 stars;2 for the price of one !;This is a great product. I have a galaxy s9 and it fast charges my phone! I would definitely recommend this to someone who is looking for an extra charger.
5.0 out of 5 stars;C Cable for new Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra;Good quality, flexible braided cord
5.0 out of 5 stars;Nice;For hunting
5.0 out of 5 stars;charging + file transfer;I actually bought this primarily to transfer files from an SSD drive (from a laptop that wouldn't boot up due to faulty hardware), and it worked great/quickly.  So this can be a dual-use charging cord plus file transfer, assuming your SSD drive has the correct input type.
4.0 out of 5 stars;No fast charge;These cables are very sturdy but the usb c connection doesnt seem to be perfect, It plugs in to my samsung galaxy 8+ but it takes some effort. Also it doesnt fast charge even with the factory wall plug.Works great on my s10+
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great charging cord;This is a well made charging cord and is a nice length for charging purposes.
5.0 out of 5 stars;I would buy it again;I am im impressed. The durability is great,  its long and works great.  I would highly recommend.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Lasted 2 weeks;The cable was fine while it lasted hasn't been 3 weeks since I purchased and it won't charge my phone unless I have it a specific way.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Reliable Charger for Affordable Price;I bought this charger in June of 2019 and it is now November 2019. The charger still does what it's supposed to do: charges my phone but it is a little worn down.I'm not complaining too much because our chargers do take a lot of beatings being yanked out of power outlets every day, transported to and fro constantly etc.The bottom line is that the charger still works which I am grateful for since it was only $5 a peice!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Must take off phone case to charge;Pros: Great rapid charger, cord length, and durability.Cons:must take off phone case to charge, which is a hassle.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works very well for phone charging, and moderately well for charging my youngest son's Chromebook;The length is a bit much for in-car charging, but very nice for everywhere in the house.
4.0 out of 5 stars;They charge;My tournament was yesterday and I nailed it. I was practicing 2 weeks ago & my favorite rope snapped. I searched everywhere for another. Then I seen these...Red...long .....beautiful replacements. They shipped fast! Jump Rope will never be the same now . They do work as a fast charger as well.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Hit or Miss;I bought the 2 pkg deal and only one charger works well.
5.0 out of 5 stars;I would recommend;I love the long cord and doesn't twist up. Charging works great.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Charging to slow. That is waste of money.  Don't like this product.;Charging to slow. That is waste of money.  Don't like this product.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Quality at a good price;Nice quality for the price. Good charger so far.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Strong charging cable;Very strong cable type charging cord
5.0 out of 5 stars;High quality!;This cable definitely surpasses my expectations! It charges my Note 9 as fast if not faster than the lightning cable that came with my phone, and this cord will probably outlast my phone! I highly recommend this cord for anyone looking for something better than the average charging cable, and I also have to add that this cord not only performs well, but it looks awesome as well!
5.0 out of 5 stars;the best;have had mine 4 years
5.0 out of 5 stars;Finally a durable cord I don't have to replace every 4-6 months!;By far the best set of cords I've ordered on Amazon. I've been ordering replacements every 4 to 6 months for my Samsung Galaxy over the last 5 years. The only disadvantage is if you have a bulky phone case, they might not fit. Strongly recommend & would buy again if they would fit my husband's phone case as well.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good for phone;Great length and works great for my Android. My Amazon tablet says it is a slow charger, though.
5.0 out of 5 stars;I would definitely buy this again;It works well. It charges my phone quickly but your adapter must be equipped with this capability.
4.0 out of 5 stars;A good value.;Is as advertised. Cant want much more than that.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Read first.;Works fine.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Fast charge;These did nit fast charge. Both firm a high amp battery or from fast charge adapter in the wall. Other cables do. Not these.
4.0 out of 5 stars;It charges the Note 8;They charge the Samsung Note 8 and that’s what I needed. The only thing I dislike is that the phone doesn’t say it’s fast charging. The OEM Samsung chargers are fast charging. Sometimes the phone will tell you it’s slow charging. But it still charges it.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Will not fast charge galaxy s8.;Cord is great quality,  however it will not fast charge my galaxy s8
5.0 out of 5 stars;Been a few weeks and still working;It's been a few weeks since I initially started using the product and it's been working great. No major issues yet though I would recommend being careful with the usbc tip of the cord just in case. I've had different brands bend and break off the tip from small amounts of pressure or wear.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Awesome cords, fast shipping.;First set got here quicker than expected but they did not fast charge. Submitted for replacment set and had it super quick! This set does fast charge. Colors are true to the pictures, very durable cords and connectors.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect;Perfect even came with an extra one and the red matches my interior perfect.
5.0 out of 5 stars;they worked well;I got these cables for my Samsung tablet, the old ones didn't fit properly and was hit and miss if they would charge my tablet. these fit nice and snug and I can use my tablet while it is charging again. they are fast charging cords would recommend these to anybody that needs a better fitting or longer cord
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great length and brand. Highly satisfied.;A great product. Love the Velcro strap to keep cord neat when not in use of to roll up access at the time of use.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Don't buy this if you're looking for USB 3.0 fast charging!!!;I needed a new cable that let me do the fast charge so I picked these because of the sturdy construction. I also didn't read the entire description because I didn't think type C charging cables existed for USB 2.0, only 3.0 for fast charging. Great design though.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good;Good product for price.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Yes fast;Long cable, love it! And it does charge fast!
2.0 out of 5 stars;I had 2 stop work right 2 days after replacement time was up.;i like that there was 5 able to buy . but i had 2 stop working 2 after the replacement time was over. i was disappointment on that part.  other that thatI love them.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not Fast Charging, but Durable;I ordered believing the cord was fast charging. It is not. Nothing on the cord or box indicates it. The cord, however is long, which I needed, and is durable. There is an 18-month warranty, so I may return it, since the product isn't as advertised. There is also a 24/7 support number. All in all, this is a very nice cord...I received two, so I do have a backup. Now, before I contact their product support, I've got to find a local store to try a fast charging cord to verify it's an issue with the cord and not my phone.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works;Value for money and charges your phone in no time
5.0 out of 5 stars;Fast Charging;Phone and tablet both register as fast charging. Long enough to use while charging without tangles
4.0 out of 5 stars;Portatil para el carro o la casa.;No tiene mucha flexibidad.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good!;Perfect length and all!
5.0 out of 5 stars;fantastic;will def buy this again in the future and refering others to this
4.0 out of 5 stars;Very durable.;The only thing I don't like is that it is a bit bulky.  Goes hand in hand with making it one of the more long lasting cables I've owned, so I can't complain too much.
3.0 out of 5 stars;This will NOT charge your IPAD PRO or IPHONE when connecting to an Older Macbook.;I'm just giving you a heads up if you are using a Macbook Pro and want to connect to your IPAD pro and newer iPhone this aftermarket cord will give you issues.  You will see your Ipad's power cycle on and off cause they are no proprietary to Apple Ecosystem.IF you want to use them to plug into a wall adapter and to just charge you will be fine. I hope that helps.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Didn't get double;I thought this came with two USB type C cables.  Turns out I got only one. This one in the picture is the second one that came with the package. It's a type C at both ends.  Be sure to check packaging!!!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Not bad so far;Came in quickly great color length and looks sturdy so far works great with my usb hub 5 stars unless it breaks quickly
4.0 out of 5 stars;Love length;Preforms as expected
3.0 out of 5 stars;Cannot offer a review for this charger ... was not compatible with my phone.;Sorry I can offer no review for this at this time ... It was not compatible with my Android phone. Disappointing. I really wanted to keep it.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Awesome Cord!;Awesomeness,  Great Product,  Long Reach, Beautiful Color!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good;We've had these for about a month. They seem to be working fine. Good amperage too.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Quality braided cables.Highly recommend!;These cables have worked as a great replacement for the cables that my cats chew through. These are braided cables so my cats can't chew though them. I would highly recommend.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Garbage;Connect disconnect Connect disconnect both cords have are ass. Sorry .. no others said they work good well for me
4.0 out of 5 stars;Got to adapt to micro back to c to get it in my phone  case;Dosnt fit into most phone cases
4.0 out of 5 stars;Length and durability 💯;I like everything but the housing is too big to fit into the charger porthole of my protective cellphone case 😳 but with a minor alteration of the housing I'm sure i can get it to fit👌😁
4.0 out of 5 stars;Use the black Samsung wall adaptors;It seemed that it was not fast charging my note 8 but I kept on switching out the wall adaptors and it looks like the black Samsung fast chargers are the only ones that have fast charged for me.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect for chafing any type c device;I love this cable. Quality and design at its max. We had it already for three months and it looks like new. I must mention that the cable is used by my 6 year old and all cables I bought before were gone on the first month. It is compatible with all TYPE C devices including Nintendo Switch.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great cable great valve;Haven't used for data transfer but charge's everything as should. Love able to use devices while charging
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging;My phone never recognizes these as fast charging (Pixel) compared to when I use a cable that came with the phone. If I need to fast charge I revert back to the original cables instead of these ones.  I do love the length of these and typically bring these if I am traveling somewhere that might not be optimized for traveler gadgets (ie old hotels with an outlet far from the bedside table).
2.0 out of 5 stars;Causes RFI noise when plugged into my car, fob looses distance when trying to lock/unlock;I purchased these USB cords to charge my S8+ while im in my Ford Explorer.  Unfortunately when they are plugged in they prevent me from using my key fob to unlock my truck unless i am right next to the door.  Through trial and error, i finally discovered that these USB cords were causing interference.  When unplugged, my key fob works as intended from all the way across the parking lot at work.  When the cords are plugged in, I have to be right next to my car to unlock it.  I had to purchase EMI RFI Ferrite Noise Filters and attach them to the cords and now everything is fine.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Funcionalidad.;Me gustó bastante. Únicamente que el cable no es poco flexible. Por lo demás ok.
5.0 out of 5 stars;I've bought a few of these;I like to color code my charges, so it's great.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Arrived with bent USBA connector;"The media could not be loaded.
                



 I can not return as the other cable is already in Production, so can not return.  I will probably buy another after talking to purchasing"
5.0 out of 5 stars;Strong and trustworthy!;I like the reinforced ends. Its strong and charges quickly. I can use an adapter on it and charge everything quickly.I definitely highly recommend it!
5.0 out of 5 stars;PERFECT;Durable and a pleasure to own. I have 6 now.
4.0 out of 5 stars;A good charging cable for S9+;It's good as described. So far not any flaw. But can be better on charging speed.
5.0 out of 5 stars;This cord is awesome;This cord is perfect for places that you need it to reach from afar & is durable.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect Chargers !!;100% Satisfied . The Cord Is Very Long , Very Durable. Very Flexible . Best Part Of All It Comes With 2 Chargers For A Great Price ..
5.0 out of 5 stars;Buy this;This is a very good product. It is durable and works as promised.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Product quality;the cable feels good quality and durable, but the type C port on my galaxy note 9 is a bit loose
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works Great;It's Durable, Charges my Phone fast.. It's a Good Charger would recommend it to anyone looking for a Fast Charger....
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging according to my own experience;Well it's been over a month since I got these cables, it says that they're fast charging but I not convinced they are it takes twice as long to charge my s9 plus than the original cables (I've tested that) one of them frayed after 2 weeks I guess it got a little tangled and it got torn,  I read under ther impression they were tough,  but I guess the fraying part could be a 50/50 fault but the charging is what bothers me ther most. ..i'm not sure I'll be buying again.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great cord;Haven't had any problems with this cord it works great
4.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't fast charge pixel;Very effective. I noticed that I can't fast charge with my pixel on this wire.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Excellent product;Great quality and much better then the O.M.E
5.0 out of 5 stars;The chargers were long enough to reach my outlets from my bed.;The price was very affordable, especially for two.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Good build bad charge;Although they are built really well no matter what plug or outlet they are in my phone can be at 80% and it's expected time is more than hour. It's been this way since I got them but as I got them for emergency it's fine just kinda sucky.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good quality;I don't feel it charges as fast as it should but it still charges quickly enough.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Durable cable with good connectors;The connections are nice and tight and the rubber around the connectors create a good connection between the wire and the connector. I like feel of the braided covering. It feels sturdy. I am using the wire in my car and the extra length allows people in the back seat to use the cable too.  I recommend this cable.
4.0 out of 5 stars;ok;Has not brok e
3.0 out of 5 stars;Usable for a year;After about a year the cables won't stay plugged into the phone. It became common to plug in overnight only to find out in the morning that the cord came loose as I sat on the table.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Charging cord  - but isn't quick;The cord is heavy and I think it will last a long time.  However, it is slow to charge but it does work.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Awesome cords;Very sturdy cords..they charge quickly..the length is great and gives me space. Very durable
2.0 out of 5 stars;Can't watch or use something while trying to charge or you'll get to 0% battery...;25% faster than other cables I don't think so. This is the second set of cables I've purchased from this brand. The first set was junk. The replacements worked fine for my printer. Now these cables do charge, but you can't run your device while they are charging or you'll get to 0% battery and it will shut off. So, they do charge, but are HORRIBLE. Do not waste your money unless you want to charge things while 100% not in use. Then they are fine.They seem strong and durable, but this means nothing if they can't charge.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not durable;I only use this product in my bedroom, and don't drag it around everywhere. Yet the rubberized end of the cord broke and the signal cuts out and won't always charge.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Charges but slowly;It charges my phone but does not work with warp for the OnePlus. 3 stars because it hasn't quit charging and the reinforcement on the cord is nice.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Durable Charging Cable;Appears to be a great replacement for my cables that had some wear and unreliable connections.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect! MUST BUY;These were a GREAT price & perfect for my Galaxy S20 plus
2.0 out of 5 stars;One cord came broken.;I don't like people that complain about products for the littlest thing, however, in this case it was actually in a condition where I couln't use it. The larger metal part of the usb cord was bent in so far that it had crushed the white connecting material inside and was unable to be plugged into a port. So one of my cord came broken, the other one works fine though. Just a little annoying, but hey, I only needed one anyway.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Don’t work with all charging blocks;I’m not sure why, but these don’t work with some charging blocks that work with USB-Lightning connectors.  They work fine otherwise.
4.0 out of 5 stars;super charges;Very sturdy and charges quickly
4.0 out of 5 stars;strong,durable;best charger so far
5.0 out of 5 stars;charges super fast;perfect length and charges fast
3.0 out of 5 stars;One worked and one did not;When one of the cables is plugged in, the device errors with a message there is water in the charger port.  The other works fine.
3.0 out of 5 stars;It looks to be a great charger if I could use it!;I'm giving the charger only 3 stars because I can't use it to charge anything. I bought it to use with my Kindle but it doesn't fit so it's back in the box and sitting gathering dust. It looks really sturdy so if you're sure it fits your needs, buy it! The core on the standard Amazon charger I have regularly gives out after 2 months. I need a sturdy, minimum 5 foot cord & charger for my Kindle Fire. If you can suggest same, please respond. Thanks!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Just like i expected;Exactly what i expected
5.0 out of 5 stars;Outstanding quality;Love these USB Type C Cables. The quality of the cable construction is great. Heavy duty aluminum ends means a long life and the braided wire covering is very tough as well. I fear the cables will outlive the phone I'm using them on.Overall the durability is outstanding, these are the best cables I've used period.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Red Type C USB Cord;The length is great the charging power is great. My problem is durability. I have had the cord since January and now it not charging when plug it in.  You have to reposition cord for it to start charging
3.0 out of 5 stars;I guess it charges;Yeah it's a good length but is a pretty slow charger. You get two but get a different one if you want a super fast charger
4.0 out of 5 stars;Overall good product;One cord works great. The other causes an error that moisture is detected and won't work.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Very fast cable;Very fast cable
5.0 out of 5 stars;QUALITY;HAS GREAT QUALITY  WORKS AS ADVERTISED WILL SEE IF DURABILITY  IS AS ADVERTISED AS TIME PASSES.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Works good;It's ok.... I do like that it has a velcro wrap attached so u can keep the cord tied up
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great cord durable and workable;I like the length and the quality material used to make and most importantly it works with my phones
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great charger;This is being used in my car and it works great !
4.0 out of 5 stars;Pleased but withhold final judgement.;Quick charge, lengthy cord. Will update cord durability in a couple of months.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great cable;I liked the brilliant color, I can distinguish it from my other cables, it's fast charging and has a comfortable length.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good but doesn't last very long;I really loved the length and the feel of the cable, worked very well as a fast charger until it didn't.  It went from fully charging my phone in 90 minutes to taking over 4 hours. I never folded or rolled the cable so that couldn't have been the issue.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Strong feel, but too stiff;I am certain these are top quality, but a bit too stiff for my intended usage.I was expecting something that I could coil up. These require a large loop and hence take more room in my bag.
3.0 out of 5 stars;meh;Product seems reasonably durable but does not charge as smoothly as the original for my S10 Plus from samsung.I got a message warning when I started to charge my phone.  It did work but took just over 4 hours to charge from 0-100%.  I don't really need to cords.  If I were to do it over again I would have just gotten an exact replacement from Samsung and spend the extra $10.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Charging power & durability;Original cord that came with the current phone had stopped charging like it did when new. This cord does the trick plus it is braided which we are told will help to keep the cord durable for a long time. The length is a bonus. Thank you! Ordered it one day and got it the next, awesome.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Wore out after five months;"The cable was used to charge my phone. It was kept in the same place the entire time. The ""A"" side was always connected to the charger brick. The ""C"" side of the cable was connected to the phone at night to charge and disconnected the next morning. After five months, the ""C"" side would connect to the phone but the phone would not charge. I replaced the cable and the phone charged normally."
5.0 out of 5 stars;Prefect chargers;This is the 2nd set I've purchased. They last forever and work great. The reinforced rubber is definitely a must!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Seems Like Good Quality;I've only used 1. It's done fine so far.
3.0 out of 5 stars;One good, one bad...;Comes with two charging cables.  One works perfectly while the 2nd one has a bad connection at the connection to my phone and will not charge.I like the product overall but I must have received a bad cable.
3.0 out of 5 stars;First cord stopped working after about 4.5 months.;Comes with 2 cords. The first cord lasted about 4.5 months before it was no longer able to charge my Galaxy S8+ while I was using any of my apps.  It could only charge if the phone was not in use.  Up until then, it did a great job with fast charging the battery.  Right now the second cord is doing a fine job. Let's see how long the second cord lasts.Update: The second cord lasted about 9 months.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Bummer;Both of my cables stopped working within a couple of days from each other....I'm staying at a motel and their power is only at 110 so I don't know what the issue could have been...I was just using these to charge my phone which is a Samsung Galaxy a10 e
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good length and strength;Charges well, most of the time, sometimes I have to take it out and put it back in for full fast charge. But the length is great and the strength/durability seems really good.
4.0 out of 5 stars;It's definitely worth the money;But I've only had it for a few months now but everything seems to be pretty good on it
2.0 out of 5 stars;50/50 chance you get dud;"They look sturdy but must be cheap. I seem to have trouble with power cords lasting longer than 3 months before my computer stops recognizing it. I bought these because of the length. I got one working and the other one will not recognize my phone. Windows keeps giving me the error""USB Device not recognized: One of the devices attached to this computer has malfunctioned and windows does not recognize it.""I know it's the cable because if I switch it out or use a different kind my phone works and I can transfer photos etc.Get tired of cables like these going out or not work after only a couple of months. I bought at the end of April. Just ridiculous."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great for the price.;Not sure about the charging power, because I believe one outlet charges faster than another
3.0 out of 5 stars;Be careful!!!;The charging some times it is good sometimes it is not good you have to adjust the wire for it to charge again.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Melted my headphone charging case;These were great til they were not. One day the cord got super hot and started melting while charging my wireless headphone case. Now my $150 headphones can only be charged wireless (thankful they still charge at all).
5.0 out of 5 stars;The Best Charge chords!!!;I Love these charge chords!  They last a long time! They are the perfect length and fit to my phone. Thank you! I recommend them to everyone I know! And if I need one it is the one I will buy every time!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great;We love these charges!!!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Why they come with two;I had these cables since March of 2019 and at first they were great. I used them constantly and the length of them made it easier to use from a distance away. Unfortunately, on this day they suddenly stopped working. They stopped working due to the braiding, which was featured as strong, snapping, making it unable for me to charge my phone any longer. I gave away the other cable to a friend but living in a household of Apple users severly limited the chargers available.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect!;Quality cord. Charges well and a great price.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Did not last as long as it should have  in my opinion.. just placed an order for a different brand;Started out ok , bug a few months later none are charging properly
2.0 out of 5 stars;Good at first, but don't last long.;These cords were great right out the box, I used one for bedside and one for my car for Android Auto. They seemed to be the answer to charging problems at first, until about the 4th month mark when both chargers started to fail simultaneously, which is odd. In my car, the connection would suddenly get lost, which was a huge pain when using the navigation. At home, I would charge my phone overnight and the next morning the charge would be at 10%. I tested other cables and wall plugs and they worked fine, but these cords are definitely the culprit.  They don't seem damaged at all and I don't do anything extra with them, they just both have shorts in them...at the same exact time. How do I find the warranty information on these? They are basically unusable at this point.
4.0 out of 5 stars;USB C Cables that just work;They charge my devices, they don't explode, catch fire, or cause any issue. All in all worth getting again.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Doesnt fit well;Sometimes it charges fast. Something it falls out
4.0 out of 5 stars;GOOD QUALITY;VERY PLEASED WITH THE DURABILITY AND LENGTH OF THIS CORD.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great product;Grewy
3.0 out of 5 stars;Disappointed about the quality;The color is great but I only use it for couple times and then it doesn't work anymore. Not good at quality as I expected.
5.0 out of 5 stars;great product;great product
3.0 out of 5 stars;Plug loosens over the and stops working;Seemed like good quality at first, but over time the USB C plug lossens up and becomes unusable. This happened to both of my cables.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Like it, and good price;Does not fast charge with the OnePlus 6T.Really like this charger, after cleaning out the type c port it fits tight and right, love this cable
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great charger;I should have gotten a longer one. But it charges fast!!!
3.0 out of 5 stars;charges phone but NOT fast charging;"I was curious as to how ""fast charging"" this cable would actually be and it's not fast at all.  I plugged into my laptop and it took almost all day for a full charge of my phone....  The cable DOES charge, but definitely NOT fast...."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Charges fast!;Love this curd.  I ha e purchased 2 sets of them for my self and my daughter!
3.0 out of 5 stars;No data transfer.;I was led to believe that this was also a data cable. If you want to use this to transfer files buy a different one.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great cord;The product was just as described and fits the need perfectly.
5.0 out of 5 stars;I buy them, the kids use them and lose them then I buy them again!!!!;The length is great.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works great;No issues, works as advertised
4.0 out of 5 stars;Worth it;Bomb af. Durable.  Would buy over n over.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't fast charge my Galaxy S8;"Love the long cord length and flexibility. Unfortunately, it does not fast charge either my Galaxy S8 or my daughter's. I have tried it with samsung's wall charger and with other usb chargers. At first when I plugged it in it would say ""fast charging"" but immediately change to normal charging speed, and now it doesn't even do that. It is still far better than the slow charge I was getting after I accidentally bent the silver casing on my original charger."
3.0 out of 5 stars;Insert part of cord gets hot on both ends!;I like the length of the cord! Exactly what I needed! Cord ends seem to get hot while charging device!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Accesible;I really like it, it’s amazing how fast it charge
4.0 out of 5 stars;Tougher than others;I go though a lot of charging cords, and have tried many different types. These last the longest by far.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Work Well;Great length and can't beat the price. Haven't had any issues with our super fast charging wall plug in for Androids.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great for charging with 1 flaw;I have a pixel phone and this charges my phone fast (with my 20watt charging brick) but the only thing that's odd is every percentage it flashes on the screen again like it's just been plugged in. It's never happened with any other charging cord or brick. It keeps flashing my phone all night. Idk if it's just a glitch or not -- I'm going to contact the seller, but overall these are nice cords.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Reliable cables;I really like the quality of the cables.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good Looking and Fast Charging.;I really enjoy the charging speed this cable provides.  They seem to be well made. I also like the look of these cables.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good item but they are starting to feel cheap;These cables used to be higher quality but it seems like they are starting to drop in quality.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Failed after two years of limited use.;I purchased these cables around two years ago as well as 8 cables from INIU and 5 from NIMASO once most of my devices required USB C. The other cables were a lower cost per cable (and still are), but at the time the JSAUX had the fastest shipping and that was the deciding factor in ordering them first. Despite only being used intermittently (my wife used these and the NIMASO cables, I have used the INIU cables exclusively), both of the JSAUX cables have failed while all of the other cables are still fully functional. There is no significant damage or wear, they simply won't register any connection or charge any devices. meanwhile the INIU cables that I have used/abused are more kinked and scraped without any sign of failure (and if there were, the INIU cables come with a 3 year warranty vs 18 months with JSAUX). I attribute the longer life of the other cables to the improved strain relief (pictured). JSAUX now makes an improved cable, but at an even higher price point.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works well;Does well to charge
5.0 out of 5 stars;Durable product;These cords are working great.  Other cords we purchased have not worked and we've had to replace them.  We are using this cord to charge our iPad Pro.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Length and price;excellent price
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good for charging, not for gaming.;These cables are good for cherging stuff, but if you were hoping to use it with one of your controllers on your console or PC you're out of luck. Plugged my 8BitDo controller into my PC with one of these cables and it came up with an error on my pc that said the device malfunctioned. Tested again with both the 8BitDo cable the controller came with and a PowerA cable from another controller and both of those cables worked just fine. If you want a USB-C cable to use for gaming I would recommend buying one of the PowerA 10ft cables instead.
3.0 out of 5 stars;one cord stopped working after 10 days ... the other is OK;2 cords in package.  Nice packaging.  The cords look well built and durable.  But after 2 weeks, one cord does not work at all - is now useless trash.  The other cord works for charging my MacBook and iPad.  But the charging is very slow, much slower than with a thunderbolt cable.  2-3 hours to charge my MacBook form 25% to 100%.  These cords are cheap, but I got what I paid for ... not much
5.0 out of 5 stars;Not what I needed;It was not what I needed to charge my iPad pencil
4.0 out of 5 stars;VERY DURABLE;Great product. I am impressed with the charging capability.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Does not do Fast Charging;I ordered a total of 4 10ft cables. Not 1 of them does fast charging. Tried with different bricks. All my 6ft cords do super fast charging with the same bricks. Using Samsung usbc bricks. I'm using a Galaxy S21 Plus.They seem to connect well and I have not had not work. But if you are looking for super fast charging these cables will not do it
3.0 out of 5 stars;usb c but its usb 2.0;USB C and USB 2.0 dont go together. Why didnt you just remove the data cables and save the few cents you could have spent and at least made it USB 3.0
5.0 out of 5 stars;Finally! A USB Cable That Can Tolerate Abuse!;I've have plenty of these 10 ft. cords from 2 years ago. Sometimes I sleep while reading on my phone and will toss and turn, pull on the cord as I'm moving, and other USB cables I would KO in a matter of weeks.These are still going strong! As a matter of fact, the only one I've lost was due to my cat chewing through it, and it took a while.Look no further. Well build and the quality is spot-on
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great build quality;Package delivered on time..good build quailty so far works great!!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great for charging and longer than typically provided with new products;Good alternative to shorter cables provided by manufacturers. Durable
5.0 out of 5 stars;Charger i;It works fine gets the job done
3.0 out of 5 stars;Adequate;The cords are of a lesser quality than I had hoped. My fast charger seems to burn them out. The problem might be with my charging cube, but this was my experience with these cords.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Only one works properly.;I've been cursed with the have to flip it due to a bad connection in one of the cables. It only charges in one orientation. Nice cable aside from the caveat.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Long cord and durable;Worth the money. Braided wires for much more durable and ofcl course it is long
5.0 out of 5 stars;Very long and great for my ps5;The awesome thing about this cable it’s long and looks durable
3.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't stay connected;Often it losses its connection.  They are cheap.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn’t last long;I’ve gone through so many usb c cords, it’s ridiculous.  This one will only charge my Mac laptop if it’s closed.  Charges my iPad ok but takes a while.  I’ve found using a Mac block and plugging it directly into the wall speeds this up.  However, the durability is awful.  They only last about a month before they either snap off or stop charging.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Unidirectional?!;The user guide says unidirectional?  Wtf who sells a unidirectional cable without saying that is what it is? The box says nothing in English about that
5.0 out of 5 stars;So far so good!;Item as expected! I have multiple cords with no problem!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good quality UBS- C to USB-C cords.;Good quality and duribility.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Charging speed;I have a s22 plus and when I first plus it in its say super fast charging then after like 30 seconds it goes to just fast charge. Idky it does this or what is wrong but just disappointed
3.0 out of 5 stars;stopped working;Worked well for a while, but eventually stopped charging my laptop. Feels loose in the socket when plugged in
4.0 out of 5 stars;Length was great!;Durability could be better!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Quality cables!;The product and packaging are outstanding. Feels good to use these. The cables are working well with my Sony headphones, PS5 controller, and Samsung cell phone. The cables are a little stiffer than I prefer and the connection fitting is a little loose, but I am a happy customer.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Would give more stars but one doesn't charge;Bought the 2 pack one works great the other just keeps connecting and unconnected. Wanted 2 for me and the husband.
3.0 out of 5 stars;When I first received them, my MacBook told me it’s not a real product;When I first received them, my MacBook told me that my battery was damaged, and it is not a real product. I used the other cord and it works fine, but I hope it doesn’t do anything crazy to my battery considering that.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Item is awesome!;Item is awesome!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works OK.;Good value. Questionable durability.
5.0 out of 5 stars;As advertised;No issues with order or product
3.0 out of 5 stars;One of the two lasted longer than two months;I've learned that buying products in this general category type (cables, chargers, or electronics accessories more broadly) is hit or miss and more often than not a miss.  This came as a pack of two and one has worked fine for two years while the other failed within a few months.  At this product's  price point I would consider that a neutral outcome.  However, a 50% success rate for any product is horrible and suggests poor quality control at the least and my guess is a prospective buyer has an equal chance of getting either zero, one, or two cables that function for a couple of years.  Still since the one working cable has lasted at least two years and the cost was low I feel three stars is a fair rating.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Sturdy, good snug click-in connections, but maybe not as flexible as you might like;Seems like good connectors, working great so far. Fine power transmission, no apparent issues. Sturdy but this means also not too flexible: If you're looking for a supple cord that bends easily to put less stress on the jacks it plugs into, then this isn't for you. But if you want a sturdy (almost stiff, even) cord that should last, and you can use it in a careful way that won't overstress the jacks, then this is 5-star so far (~1 month use to date.)
3.0 out of 5 stars;Don’t charge between devices;These cables only change devices from wall/main outlets. Beyond data transfer they cannot charge between devices. Plugged my iPad into my MacBook and charging was not supported only data transfer. Just a heads up if you intend to use these cables for multipurpose charging use.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Works beautifully at first;Love the extra length and how well they work at first. After about a month the cables charge less and less. What previously took a couple of hours to recharge takes several hours, sometimes all night.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Issues charging with lower battery;Cables work fine when phone battery is 75% or above. When battery falls below that, a rapid charging notice continually cycles across the screen not allowing the phone to sleep. Using a 20W charger with USB-C connection to a Pixel 7 phone. Short cable that came with the phone and one I just purchased from another  manufacturer as a replacement do not exhibit this behavior. Cables seem durable but this behavior is unacceptable fearing damage to the phone. Past the return window by a few days.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Meets my requirements;The cables appears durable and meets my expectations.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not the best!;It looks Sturdy and they have a very nice design so cute. yet they break so very easily.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Very Nice;These two cables are very nice and thick. The braided cord provides sturdiness to the cables and they work as intended. They are exactly what they are advertised both by looks and specs from the seller.The box however that it came in was smashed. Could possibly be a transportation issue.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Pixel 2xl loves this cable - read their love story;The original cable I had got battered during it's service. It had a lot of wounds when the drawers were attacking. And then one day it just died leaving my pixel 2xl behind. After a long day with really low battery when pixel got back home it found that the cable was no longer charging. I tried all ways to bring it back. Tried different power sockets and both ends of cable but it was time to say goodbye.  I walked to the nearest convince store to find a replacement cable. It did bring back the pixel back to life but pixel felt sad. It did not charge as quickly as it did with the original cable.  Then the pixel was swiping of Amazon to find its perfect partner and then it came across this cable.  It was like love at first sight and the date was set in two days. The delivery guy posted a pic of the cables sitting at my doorstep nicely dressed in the prime bubble wrap. I picked it up and immediately connected it to the pixel.  And things just clicked, pixel charged rapidly as before.The cable was looooooong as compared to the original one. It was also braided which meant that this would last long :) and the kicker is they are twins. Pixel would be really happy to have one of them at office and the other one at home.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Nice length but fail after about 6 months of regular use;This is still not a bad product but you have to be careful and not twist the ends at all if you do the cable will faili bought the two pack and the first one lasted about 6 months.. the second one seems to be ok
4.0 out of 5 stars;FUNCTIONS AS DESIGNED.;WORKS AS DESIGNED. DOES WHAT I WANT IT TO DO.
4.0 out of 5 stars;average durability;thought would be more durable, but the end C portion did not like repeated connect/disconnect,
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great cable!;Great quality with superb craftsmanship make this a great buy.
5.0 out of 5 stars;High quality!!!;These cables have high quality material. Is more than I expected for the price!!!
4.0 out of 5 stars;I use this to charge my Android OnePlus 8;Pretty decent quality I don't know or can verify if it actually supports a full 60 watts like it claims however it does charge pretty fast and does its job it's a little bit longer than the cable the phone came with which is what I was looking for.
3.0 out of 5 stars;One of the cords stopped working today.;Had these almost a year. They worked well. Then all of a sudden one just died. Other cord is still going strong. Kind of disappointed that one stopped charging.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Seems to be solid quality materials.;"Cord seems to be made of quality materials.  I actually read the description wrong when I bought it, I was pleasantly surprised to find out I had bought two cables.  I had been using the stock usb c charger for Pixel 2 XL since I got it and I would often go to bed and realize my battery was about to die.  The cord on that thing isn't very long and I like to watch youtube vids until I pass out most nights so I got a bigger cord. I discovered a while back that not all usb cables are equal when it comes to charging speed.  I was trying to plug my phone into a computer with a usb 3.0 to usb C cable and it would say ""charging slowly"" on my phones display.  And if I used that same cable with a random regular charger it was say ""charging""  But usb c to usb c always results in ""charging rapidly"""
5.0 out of 5 stars;Durable;Great charger. Very durable. It's been lasting for over a month now and charges just fine for both of my phones
4.0 out of 5 stars;It charges CP fast.;A little bit stiff and hard to manage but that should help the longevity.
3.0 out of 5 stars;One worked, one didn't.;Bought the 10ft 2 pack less than 2 weeks ago. Cord #1 was working great until our new puppy chewed through it this morning. No big deal, that's why I bought a 2 pack. Unfortunately cord #2 just straight up doesn't work. Tried plugging into different blocks, switching the ends around, nothing. I'll give 3 stars for the cord that did work, but be warned you might be sent a product that doesn't work.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not good;I didn't realize that I actually bought this brand before for a previous phone, if I had I never would have purchased this again. Original variety bundle pack with I purchased all stopped working within a few months. The new ones that I ordered for extra length came with a short in them with both cords. They can not support ultra fast charging (45 watt) or higher. My shorter 4 ft cord that came with the 45w brick charges my phone just fine but not these longer cords. They get a 2 because they are indeed longer and feel premium although they are definitely not and I'm sure they'll both be dead by the spring time. Not worth your money! Believe me!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great product but not very durable;This is a great charging cable, very fast, and long enough for me to use it in bed after turning the other way. My only issue is that the connector becomes loose after a bit and you have to make sure to bend it a certain way for your phone to charge. Annoying!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Favorite cords!;I upgraded from the Samsung Note9 to the Note20 Ultra a couple months ago. The cord that comes with the phone is too short for my liking. We have our bed raised pretty high and if I want to scroll on my phone before I crash, the original cord made my life miserable. With this cord, I can turn the completely opposite direction and have plenty slack. They are very sturdy and won't be breaking any time soon. I had been using this same brand for my Note9 but switched to this cord because the new brick for the Note20 is USB-C to USB-C. (Note9 was a USB to USB-C)
5.0 out of 5 stars;New phone, New cables;I bought a new Samsung phone, like anything else, you need new cables because they change the charging ports.  These cables were great, price was another lower than buying from the phone store.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Lightning-Fast Cord but doesn't last;These cords have blazing fast speeds, if your phone and outlet charger supports it, but in about five months they begin to not connect properly.  I suspect there is a lack of durability in the wire to end connection that wears out much faster than it should.  Works great when new though, but pricey for something that doesn't last.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good quality;Nice cable but way to stiff.
4.0 out of 5 stars;A quality Charging Cable...;This cable will not fail from the Norman bending and flexing from everyday use when charging your devices.  It is very well built and rugged.
4.0 out of 5 stars;As described.;Cord works well with my s22 phone.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Falls out of Samsung Note 10 +;Do not get this if you have a Note 10 +. It will NOT stay plugged in while you use your device (falls out and comes loose so easily). Hopefully it works on other devices but I wouldn't know.Edit: Great customer service, issued a full refund a few days later. Hopefully this works for your device because everything else about it is good (durability, length, etc)
3.0 out of 5 stars;Will not do Samsung DEX.;Nice cable, very well made and works great for charging at a high rate.  Bit, it will not do Samsung DEX.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Does not transmit video;Quality seems good. Length as advertised. Provided power to my laptop. Did not send video from laptop to large monitor, which is what I needed it for.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Strong and reliable and high quality too. These are great cords!;The length is so great that I don't have to worry about breaking the wires inside at the plugs. I get full rapid-charge from my fast charger.
2.0 out of 5 stars;One of the cords stop working after using it for a couple days;One of the cords stopped working after using it a few times I actually ordered a few more cords from someone else just in case the other one stops working
3.0 out of 5 stars;Compatibility;Can't evaluate durability since just acquired product.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works exactly as I expected it to.;It fast charges even at this length and hasnt worn out quickly works slowly on data transfers but its the worst. Seems durable but not over exaggerated bends repeatedly so beware of that. But very much not low quality.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Fast Charge If It Works;As soon as I plugged this in, it would go out every few seconds. Its first 10 minutes charging it lost power...while plugged in...I tried other items in this outlet, and this cord in somewhere else and the cord is the problem.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Want to give it more, but did not work for my application so at the same time wanted to give it less;I have a laptop dock that uses a USB-C to USB-C cord to connect the dock to the laptop. The dock manual says the cord that came with the dock can handle up to 20V @ 3A i.e. this is the max. This cable says it can handle 20V @ 3A, but when I plug my laptop into my dock using this cord it does not work. It will connect and will work some what, but there is constant cutouts, which then when it reconnects my computer has to reconnect to my internet, my VPN network, all my accessories like my keyboard, mouse, speakers etc. that are also connect to the dock, and for some reason cut out at the same time, and then their software also needs to be cycled in order for them to work properly again.I originally purchased this for a bit extra length because the cord that came with the dock is only one meter, but sure enough, once I reconnected the stock cable that came with the dock no more cut outs.. So I'm not sure exactly the issue, it could be a slurry of different things, but it is in fact the cable that was the issue.I'm sure it will work great for charging phones and this cable hasn't moved anywhere other than my home office desk, so the durability wasn't necessarily tested, but out of the box the durability and built quality seem to be above average. Also I just tried to plug it into my phone (Galaxy S10+) to see/feel the connection, and it fits in really well and you can feel that click into place. I have purchased other cables here on Amazon and they don't have that click that holds the cable into the phone so if you slightly bump, move, or the cable stiffness is forcing the cable into the phone at an angle, you will lose connection to the power source and it will either stop charging, or will say like 7.5 hours until fully charged, which it should take like an hour, maybe two with a slow charger. Either way, this is why I gave it two stars instead of just one.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Performs as expected;These cables are very well made and perform very well connecting Android phone to the SUV's audio system.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works great!;Works perfect!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Well built and good warranty;"I got these because soo many usbc cords have failed me.  The JSAUX had some of the best reviews when they came out and have a good warranty.  If had seen Anker Powerline II (lifetime) had came out I likely would have gone with them... my go-to for cables due to easy return policy, but I expect these to last a fair bit.  Not as plyable as I would like but Im OK with that. One in each car and one for lugging around. Also only 60W (I have a MBP 15"" so it can use 100W) and usb2 speeds (480mb) vs 10gb for the Anker.  So yeah... go with the Anker for a few bucks more unless you just want some simple charging cords for the car - as I do.  Some reviews suggest lifetime warranty on these but it is not advertised anywhere - nor do I recall seeing a warranty card when I got it."
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great !;Charging a phone
5.0 out of 5 stars;Durable but inexpensive;"I use these for charging mobile power storage units.I bought some of the red earlier and they were fine.  I got these blue cables to help differentiate them without marking the date on them.They seem to charge the units just fine.  However, they do not work in devices with an included ""use this cable only"" cable.The only problem I really have with any such cables is that they always seem to find my feet and I pull something off the table or desk while it's being charged.  I should be a bit more aware, obviously.I would certainly recommend these, even though they look the same as a dozen other brands."
5.0 out of 5 stars;Quality USB-C Cables;I was after quality. I found it with this brand. I've already purchased an additional pair. A definite recommendation !
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not 45W compatible;"Did not perform like original charging cable with my 45W charger. See attached photos. The original charger cable provides true ""Super Fast 2.0"" at a faster 45W charge on my Samsung S22+.  This cable only supplies ""Super Fast"" charge rate of 25W with a slower charge rate. It works, but not at the performance advertised."
3.0 out of 5 stars;It’s what it is supposed to be;It’s just what I ordered and it works like it is supposed to do
5.0 out of 5 stars;Purchase this cord on March 15, 2022 and 3 months later it has stop charging.;This cable stop working within 3 months of purchase
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good;Great value.
4.0 out of 5 stars;This will not run video. It’s just a charging cable;Does not do video. Only for charging
5.0 out of 5 stars;A+++ for  JSAUX USB C to C cable Fast Charger Nylon Braided Charging Cord Compatible.;I don't often author reviews. however, when I do it is within the context that opinions are not substitutes for facts. If a product meets expectations,  the ratings of the general public consensus often echo my sentiments I stand in silent agreement. If a product exceeds my customer experience and expectations and my opine maintain it warrants five-star praise and perhaps a sprinkle of some constructive criticism.  On the contrary, if the product customer experience for me is the inverse and the customer experience is unsatisfactory, then one or two stars is the pretext of my written critique. Now on the to the product review of USB C to USB C Cable [2 Pack 6.6ft], JSAUX USB-C to USB-C Fast Charger Nylon Braided Charging Cord Compatible.FIVE STARS across the board.I have purchased several. Nothing short of excellent QC + QA manufacturing process. flawless form, function, and performance. Highly recommended. Unit cost may be fractionally higher than competitors, however, the expense is worth the quality and performance ROI (return on investment)
4.0 out of 5 stars;Cable;Very nice with the cord strap
3.0 out of 5 stars;One of the two just stopped working;I got a two pack that I started using in mid-January. Now a little over two months later, one of them no longer works. I tested the ports, the adatper, and outlet and it is the cord. It's in a low traffic area and has been very gently used and handled. The other one is in my travel bag so getting little use but still works.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Superb!!!;This is a SUPER DOPE CABLE...
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great Cord;Great cord. Just as advertised.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Charging wire;Very disappointed in charging time. Takes much longer than expected.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great cables. Ordered a second set!;Cables are cables, right?Not at all. I got a set of these way back, so I could charge a phone at home and keep a cable in my car. Awesome. Works great/functions well. The braided nylon material seems to hold up better than plain rubber cable. The ends have not broken/chiped/torn etc. The little velcro cable-keeper is a nice touch.Sadly, I misplaced one of my beloved cords, so I've ordered another set!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Cable feels cheap;The cable feels cheap and the connectors do not feel sturdy. Definitely not a premium cable
5.0 out of 5 stars;Second Set of JSAUX Cables;I originally bought USB-A cables from JSAUX a few years ago (okay, probably more like five years ago) for my old Samsung Note 5.  The cables performed really well.  When I needed new USB-C cables I decided to order them from JSAUX instead of another company that I really like and I have not been disappointed.  I really like having a backup cable for those just in case moments.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Quality Cables Indeed!;Bought these to charge our Samsung TV remotes...as they came with solar chargers on them that weren't too impressive. Then we noticed they had usb c ports....hence the purchase! Nice cables with a nice braiding outer sheath....and plenty long. Awesome!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Wrong cord for my phone.;I tried to get new charging cord gor my S-20 cell phone. This one did not fit. I returned it.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Usb-c cable;Works fine no problem so far
3.0 out of 5 stars;Decent cables;The cables are good i bought 2 sets but within a week 1 cable is having problems disconnecting randomly already
3.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't fit inside case;Seems like a sturdy charger but the plastic is so bulky that it won't fit inside a standard waterproof case for s21 ultra. I would have to remove the case every time I want to charge it. Returning for a slimmer charge cord.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Did not intend to purchase this item.;The item was not what I needed.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Does NOT support Samsung 45w charging.;This cable does NOT support 45w fast charging 2.0 for the S22 Ultra or the S22 plus. It will only support 25w super fast charging 1.0.Another downside is that although we'll built, the cable is very stiff.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Very worthy cable;This cable for 2x a pack is absolutely amazing. The 6 foot length is absolutely perfect and even with being a non OEM cable, it does fast charging (0 to 100/ 1hr 13m on a Galaxy s21+), has a great usable length, and doesn't get tangled or anything. I'm glad that I can find durable, reliable cables for usb c-usb c cables for cheaper than original manufacturer that work as they should given the provided length compared to original overpriced cables. Highly recommend
4.0 out of 5 stars;Ok but doesn’t last long;Great for the money but they stop working very quickly
4.0 out of 5 stars;Long and durable;Nice and long so I can use my phone while it's charging. A 5-6 foot cable sounds long until your wall socket is at the baseboard and behind the bed and won't reach to your nightstand when your phone rings at night, so the extra length is great. Tough enough that my cats can't chew through it too!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Connectivity Problems 5 Months Later;UPDATED 09 08 20 The cable still works. Though I noticed that there is no way to clip the wire into the port like the genuine cables do. In bed plugged in wire on my chest and the cable just pops out. When I charge it I have to make sure that it's charging since the cable randomly pops out of the charging port.It does what it's supposed to. But if you move your phone around a lot while charging. This isn't the cable for you.UPDATED 05 21 19 These work well.  They charge the phone fast.  Though the one USB C that goes into the phone on one of the cables doesn't work properly all of the time.  The cable i rarely use has issues charging the phone.  When the phone is touched the phone no longer charges without notice.  The other cable that i use all of the time does not have this issue.  not sure what is happening though i have no issues with the other one.Original ReviewFast Charge Works but You Need A Proper Power SourceTo use fast or quick charge you have to use a power brick that supports it.  A USBc cable and a USBc charger doesn't work for quick or fast charge. The cables are compatible if you have the proper charger to do so, such as the charger that came with the Google Pixel 2.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Mediocre charge rate on Oneplus 7T;Charge rate is limited to 2000mA (10W). must be related to it being only USB 2.0 (I'm guessing the phone and the charger can't negotiate).  It's OK, but not any better than the old USB A to USB-C cords I've been using.  By contrast, a full USB-C 3.0 data cable can charge at the expected 3000mA.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Very sturdy, well made, fast charging cord!;This charging cable is better than any I've bought before. I always end up using my phone while it's charging, which bends the cord, and then it breaks. This cord is very durable. I've been using my phone a lot while it's charging and the cord doesn't look like it will break. I don't even want to think about all the money I've wasted on cords that only lasted weeks or even days, so I'm thrilled with this cord, plus it's nice to have one that's a pretty color!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Convenient length;Ease of use.  The length is great.
5.0 out of 5 stars;These cables are top quality;They feel like they will last forever. I feel confident about using them to charge my cell phone.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Look nice, but don't work...;Was excited about these. Reviewslooked good. Plugged them in to a good charging plug and it showed rapid charging. A few seconds later, my phone started alerting that the cord was off. few seconds more and another buzz saying it was connected. Every 1-3 seconds it cuts off and on. Very annoying. The cord is securely in, just not good. Tried it with another plug and other cord and does the same thing. Buyer beware! Pay more and get quality.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Seemed nice, but didn't transfer data as stated;They look quality and came quickly/well packaged. F you're just looking for something to charge your devices, these may work and could be a good purchase.However, testing multiple devices they would not transfer data. Phone to computer, laptop to external storage, laptop to dock/external monitor, nothing!2 stars - if you're only looking for a few more charging cables they seem relatively nice. I cannot speak to longevity as they did not meet my need.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great Cable. But...;WARNING: If you have a UAG FOLIO CASE for the iPad Pro 12.9” 2018 like me, there is a slight problem while plugging the cord in. You have to pull back on the case and then plug the cable in because the cable is too thick at the connector, which is slightly blocked by the edge of the case. Other than that it works great and charges quickly and I have no other problems with the cable. Length is perfect for daily needs and this cable is very durable and should last you a long time.If you found this review helpful make sure to let amazon know by hitting the helpful button.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Did not work for 60W charger;Brought this to be attached to a Blitzforce GaAN (BFG) compact laptop USB-c/USB-a charger as a spare one to the barrel port charger for my DELL latitude laptop.Looks like this cable is unable to provide 20V @3A to the laptop BFG to Laptop when only USB-C is in operation. So is it a problem with the new BFG or with the cable.I have a better USB-C->USB->C cable from a different traditional 85W charger  that is able to pull 60W + sans problems..I had a really old Transmart USB-C->USB-C, I got for my phone about 3 years back at 1/2 the price of this. When I use that, I am getting the same performance. The same yellow warning and time to charge on my laptop. So returned this and got a 100W Twin pack for just 2$ more.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Nice quality but disappointed;I was tired of the short length cable that came with my phone so i purchased this and it charges slower than my old one... pretty disappointing honestly
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not for long term use;Chargers didn't even last a year.  One was used in my bedroom for a night charger and went out after about 6 months.  The other wasn't used very often and also stopped charging as well.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Be Careful;They work great, but I will say this: because of the way the plug is designed, it sticks out quite a bit further from your phone than my OEM cable. I have no doubts on the cables durability, but I suspect that this will eventually impact the port on your phone if you use it while charging it. Take care not to hit it around too much.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great cable, glad now I have two.;Charging phone, great length,
3.0 out of 5 stars;I have a finicky phone, wouldn't make contact with the wire. Not the wires fault ..;Nice product, just didn't work on my finicky phone.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good Charger for Pixel 2;I've only had the product for less than a week, but it works well so far to replace an old shorter cord.I ran into trouble with fit at first and I almost returned it. I didn't realize how dirty the charging port on my phone was. Once I cleaned the port on my phone (alot of pocket lint came out) this worked perfectly.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Does the job until it doesn't;The cable length is great. The braided cable is great. For the price, this is a good buy if you expect to replace them every few months. Everything was well-built EXCEPT the most vital part, the housing for the wires at the jack. So unsurprisingly, it stopped working overnight unless I kept it still at the perfect angle. I just re-ordered. I highly recommend electrical tape immediately applied to both ends. I have been using this with a Samsung Chromebook Plus (first gen) and another company's wall adapter. The wall adapter end is fine. My charging port is fine. Have had to make do with a backup solution that will only charge if it's off until I get this replacement that I am going to wrap up like a mummy.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works but doesn't stay in properly;"Have only a week experience with both the cables.With an 18w charger, both rapid charges my brother's Pixel 2 XL but doesn't stay. No ""click"" feel when plugging the cord in. Tried a amazon basics one and that works fine. This would be a great deal but keeps coming out when he charges his phone overnight which he uses as his work alarm.Length is nice. Feels sturdy, but bending will cause some kinks later."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Not working when controlling Osmo pocket with it;I bought this as extension cord to control my DJI Osmo pocket with my android phone. The quality of the product is very good, the cord is heavy. It works well when I use it to charge my phone or Macbook pro. It also tansfers data between devices perfectly. When I usde it to connect my phone to control my Osmo pocket, it appeared to get connected for a second or so, then the connection would be lost. I then tried to adjust my phone usb connection to image or data transfer, it simply did not respond at all. I returned, for I only need it for controlling my Osmo pocket.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Charging cord;Broke after a month
3.0 out of 5 stars;It was fine when it worked for 3 months.  Now I’m past my return window!;It worked okay for three months.  Then it stopped working.  And now I’m out of the return window.  Makes me so mad that I’m stuck with a worthless cable that won’t charge my iPad Pro. So I went ahead and bought a genuine Apple 6 ft. USB-C charging cable at Target.  I hope this one lasts!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Only one cord works.;One cord makes my pixel 6 pro constantly vibrate while charging. The other one works just fine and doesn't cause this.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works ok.;Works good, get full super fast charging rate on my note 20 ultra 5g. Durability wise the cable is quite stiff maybe single core wire not stranded. Probably won't hold up to repeated bending near connectors.
3.0 out of 5 stars;THE FIT - A POSSIBLE CAVEAT DEPENDING ON YOUR CELLPHONE CASE;"This looks like a VERY well made product. It's the first ones I ordered from this company having previously only used the AINOPE brand in recent years.HOWEVER, the one caveat I refer to is for the USB C connector to the cellphone, the thickness of the cable end may interfere with getting it into the cellphone female c receptacle depending on the size &thickness of the cellphone case opening for that connection.  I have to jiggle the cable a little to ""nudge"" it in fully since the edge of the case opening for my case very slightly catches the edge of the male c connector assembly.That's the only reason I gave this 3 stars instead of 5."
2.0 out of 5 stars;Too stiff, kinks and tangles too much;While it is very inexpensive and seems sturdy enough, the problem with the JSAUX cable is it’s too stiff. It easily gets kinks which can keep a neatly rolled up cable from unwinding cleanly without tangles and knots and could wear it out prematurely. It doesn’t seem to be the nylon covering that is causing it, but more the wiring inside.I didn’t think to review it until I got some Aukey and Anker cables to compare. Those are a lot less stiff, especially the Aukeys, and less problematic.Also, the connectors at the ends are metal and longer than the others. This makes the inflexible section of the cable that protrudes from the device it is plugged into noticeably longer. This might not be an issue for you, but it can make holding and charging your phone more awkward, or require more clearance in front of the device to allow it to bend (like when it is coming from a wall charger). By loose comparison, original Apple cables in my experience break the most but bend the easiest and soonest after the plug in point. I think there’s a trade off here between flexibility and strength.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Does not support fast charging;This cord does not support fast charging. When u swapped it out for another cord which did I was able to verify the problem was with this cord.  I will be returning these as the whole point of the USBC connector is for fast charging
4.0 out of 5 stars;Very Stiff Cable;Seems like a good cable. Maybe preference, but I subtracted 1 star as these cables are very stiff compared to other braided USB cables I've owned. That makes it harder to wind and store as well as creates a lot of bends and kinks when in use.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Worked for 9 months. Does not work anymore.;I bought this set of cables in September 2020. The length is about 6 ft, and it was a great purchase. However, I would suggest not to bend the wires at the ends. I used them regularly, and within a few months, the ends became bent and would not go back to normal, which was fine as it did not prevent me from using them. However, last week one of the cables no longer works, and it's the one with the hard bent at one of them ends—good cables but not durable, 3/5.
3.0 out of 5 stars;No data transfer for me;The cable description claims it supports data transfer, but all I got was power. I get data transfer using a USB-C to USB-A cable, so I'm returning this. I can't say whether this is a device limitation or a cable problem.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Where's the other end of the charger;The ends are the same thing. There's no way for me to charge my phone or Bluetooth. $12.99 and I wasted my money. I didn't know that I had to get the wall plug in charger separately
5.0 out of 5 stars;love these cables!;I bought these cables to charge my pixel 3a and so far, so good. they're sturdy and charge the phone rapidly. plus, they look great! (haven't used them to tansfer data so I can't comment on that matter).
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good Value;This is obviously not the best product given the low price but it gets the job done and it is a great value. It doesn't charge as fast as the more expensive cables. However, the length is great
4.0 out of 5 stars;It's a charger;Its alright
4.0 out of 5 stars;Charges very Quick!;It has my Samsung S20 charged in 15 minites. Afraid it might catch the house on fire. I only use this cable unless I want my phone charged very fast. Would buy again.
1.0 out of 5 stars;It keeps disconnecting.;I love the length and when I first started using it, it was working great. But after couple of days, I notice that the cable would get disconnected and would flash on the screen like I just plugged it in. It seems like the USB is loose in the phone  I really wanted to like this but the quality is just not there.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good solid cable a little stiff but works great.;Very good cable no problem with either one.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Best cable to charge that new phone!!👍;Bought a new phone and needed a good charging cable, this one filled the need, as it's durable, allows super fast charging and is just the right length!! :)
3.0 out of 5 stars;Very good at first but broken after;I loved this product at first but after 1-2 months of using the cords don't work anymore.Not very durable.I would use a different product as this don't last. Only nice at first.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Disappointing…Charges so slow;I always plug in my iPad when I go to sleep around 10:30/11 and when I get up at 8 it’s at around 65-70%.  Ridiculous, advertises to be a fast charger and it absolutely is not.  Disappointed ☹️
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not long lasting;Stopped working a few days after getting it.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Works for power but not much else;Works great for powering my laptop from its adapter, not so great when I need to run outfit from my video camera to a portable flash drive. It didn’t have the data integrity I needed and we lost the day shooting because of it. I don’t know where there is a cable issue or connector issue but if it’s mission critical like data you might want to consider getting a better kid. If you’re just looking for cables to power your laptop or other USB C devices
5.0 out of 5 stars;As advertised;Very durable
4.0 out of 5 stars;Sturdy, but a bit Heavy;These are attractive and appear to be well made, but are much heavier than my OEM 60watt cable. In a bag where I’m trying to minimize the weight of all my accessories and cords, I will probably look for something else.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Don't be in a hurry;The product seems fine enough but it's took a month to receive it. If you don't have Amazon prime the shipping and time it takes to receive the product aren't worth it.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good customer service;Had problems with my original purchase. These cables don't work with Pixel 2 has advertised. However the JSAUX customer service sent me replacements that are from a different listening that work perfectly fine. Sent replacements without needing to spend my time & money returning non working cables. Would rate 5 stars hadn't I had to go through hassle of having to email for replacement's. Kinda expect brand new products to work.
4.0 out of 5 stars;As advertised;Color was correct 👌
1.0 out of 5 stars;Lasted 7 days;I used this cable for 1 week. Then it would charge on and off 1 second on and one second off. Checked other cable and is working for now. Waste of money.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Don't waste your time... get it else where.;At first for the first 2 wks, it would charge my phone in about 30-45 mins. Not complaining.. but after about a month it would take 2.5 hrs. About 6 wks in it would take 4hrs. I ended up buying a new charger and it's been 3 wks and charges in less than an hr. In 15 mins I can go from 15% to 45%.It did get to me fast. But the durability honestly sucks.
5.0 out of 5 stars;They work;Well, they asked me to review it.They work.They're sturdy, being braided.I don't really know if they charge faster or not since I haven't checked on it.Don't know the durability, since I just got them a few weeks ago, but I expect them to last for years since they are reinforced at the ends.We'll see!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Nice cable with slow data speeds;If you're looking at these cables to use for charging devices then you're probably okay, but if you plan to use them to transfer data you should look elsewhere. The data transfer speed is roughly 1/10th of what USB c is typically capable of. For instance, one of my external drives runs about 450 Mb/s using a different cable. With this cable, granted it's longer, but the drive drops to 40 Mb/s which is completely unacceptable. Fortunately, I bought these as charging cables for my iPad Pro and they work great for that use. I just can't use them for data transfer.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great product.;Works great. I use it with my 25W Samsung quick charger. The additional length and quality helps significantly.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Definitely worth it;The design of the cord helps keep it tangle free and it its super fast .
5.0 out of 5 stars;So far so goos;Does the job.  Decent price.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works well when plugged in.;Charges like a champ when it stays plugged in. I'm not sure if the connection issue is with my phone or the cable as some cables I've tried hold great while others slip out constantly.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Amazing fast charging. Better than oem;Cords are better than samsung oem. Not sure why paying over a $1000 and phone companies can't provide a high quality cord. apparently apple set the standard to burn customers and samsung followed.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Hard to tangle;Tough braided outer cover makes these hard to tangle. I use these in the car, and they do great.Highly recommend.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works great, supports super fast charging with 25 watt Samsung block on S20fe;Works great so far, sturdy, long, charges just as fast as original Samsung cable. Super fast charging works perfect for S20fe with 25 watt Samsung block
4.0 out of 5 stars;Encontrar todo lo que necesitas;Lo uso todo los días
2.0 out of 5 stars;Barely charges;I’ve unfortunately had to purchase way to many of these because they barely charge my child’s iPad. Meaning it takes forever or doesn’t work at all. I’ve ordered apple chargers and Verizon chargers that don’t perform much better so I feel like we’re all getting scammed by these companies.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Worth buying;The cord length is perfect and so far seems pretty robust. Happy with my purchase.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Love it!!;I love the color, stands out just enough to be seen but it's not distracting or out of place.The attached Velcro for storage is an awesome and helpful touch.I've only had them for 2 weeks so we'll see how long they last/ how they hold up over time.They are slightly heavier than the other cords I've had, not a bad thing it's just noticeable.Length is perfect, not too long/short.They fast charge as long as you have the proper wall adapter.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good value but don’t let them get coiled. Try to keep them straight.;These work for a while but seem to coil up and when they do they stop working as well. But good deal for the money.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Very good but not great;I really like this cord but if it had more reinforcement on the heads it would be top notch.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good cables;These cables work well with our Samsung phones and fast chargers which is the reason for the purchase. I have only used them a couple of times for simple data transfer and have not found any issues. I have tried larger video data file transfers with great success.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good solid cable I have had it for several months;Only give it a four-star because mine did break. However the company honors their warranty and did replace it
4.0 out of 5 stars;Looks like quality at an attractive price...;These are attractive, nicely packaged and come with a leather cable tie. I am using then for power delivery from an Aukey wall unit to a Lenovo Yoga 920 and the charge function does work.I do not plan to use these for data transfer as I have more premium cables for that purpose.As I was prompted to write a review shortly after purchase, I cannot comment on longevity/ultimate build quality at this time.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice gift;This was a gift and the user is very impressed.
5.0 out of 5 stars;great length and sturdy cable;I purchased this cable to use next to my bed where I like to watch videos or read before I go to sleep. I usually would get them from Walmart or 5below but could not beat this price or now that I know the quality 10/10 would recommend to anyone to buy from this seller.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great Price and Quality;This was the solution of my original samsung cable ate by my dog. This cords work great. They support Ultra Fast Charging for S20 Ultra.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped working after 5 months;I bought a 2 pack of these cords. One works okay, the other has started doing this really fun thing where I have power for one second, not the next, then it comes back again, then disappears. I'd rather it stop working altogether than work intermittently! Oh well. (For the record I tried plugging it into other outlets, switching which end of the cable was plugged into my phone, etc.)
4.0 out of 5 stars;Fast charge. Great price for multiple items.;Fast charging but didn't realize i also need to purchase wall piece for indoors as well as additional pieces in order to charge in the car or computer. I was excited about the price for the quantity given that I failed to see neither end has a USB plug to it.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Fast and reliable;I use this cable with an SSD drive for video editing and so far so good.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great durable cable;Good durable charging cable. Braided cord is really good. Fast charging,even my laptop too.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works perfectly to charge my USB C MacBook Pro;I bought this to power my 2019 MacBook Pro 15 i7 using apple 80w charger . It works as the original apple charging cable but at a cheaper price . Very sturdy connection and strong cable and plug
2.0 out of 5 stars;USB-C to USB-C Cable did not last very long. Perhaps it is just inferior quality.;This USB-C to USB-C Cable two pack worked, but not for very long. I will buy another brand that will last longer. Do not recommend.
3.0 out of 5 stars;BE CAREFUL;One came out working Great. But the other one did not work at all. I only needed one and I don't want to spend the time returning it.Other than that the feel of the cord is great. It feels really sturdy. The USB port easily fits into my phone. Super long just as advertised. The grip is easy too. Feels like it'll last for a long time.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works well;This cable fits perfectly and works well.  It is a bit big and heavier than I needed but is of excellent quality.  It fast charges our Pixel 3XLs very nicely.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Cable Rating;These cables are great quality and have no problems charging my phone. I've never got the warning saying my phone has a weak charge. I use it at work on a daily basis. Doesn't feel like the chord will give out or break any time soon. Still feels like new. The plug fits perfectly in the phone and charger.
2.0 out of 5 stars;They only fast charge sometimes.;Some time they fast charge sometimes they don't.
5.0 out of 5 stars;quality cable;I bought this cable for charging a Galaxy S20 with the stock charger. The length and construction are great. It also works flawlessly with ultra fast charging. I recommend this product.
5.0 out of 5 stars;The must have cord;I love the color and the sturdy of the cords. It’s connects to the device and it stays there. It has a good grip
2.0 out of 5 stars;Worked great until It didnt;Love the length, fast charging. But less than 3 months later the charger just decided it didn't want to charge. Tried it on multiple devices, same thing. Would charge and then stop.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Sturdy...;Charges effectively, well made, rope doesn't unravel.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Solid and durable;Feels very durable for on the go use. Charges somewhat fast, though not as great as the oem part.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice cord;I like this product.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Just a regular charging cable to me;i thought this cable would of pushed more power to my Samsung note 8 phone but it doesn't. i get the same charge duration even with my oem cable that came with the phone. and yes i am using quick charge 3.1 charging devices.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not great quality;This cable lasted just over a year.  Where the cable attaches to the plug, it becomes worn.  Now I can't get a charge.  It works great while it is in pristine condition but it won't stay that way if you use your phone while it's charging.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works!;Used a replacement for my charging cable for my pixel 3a. I bought a previous one and it failed within a month. However due to the lowe price, it's worth it. Additionally the second cord I've received has lasted about 4 month, so I'll call it a win!
5.0 out of 5 stars;These are awesome!;Our 8 month old puppy chewed up my daughter's charger for her apple laptop so I had to order a new one asap. I ordered these and they work perfectly.....just like the apple cord we had. The cable is durable and a very pretty blue color. I highly recommend
3.0 out of 5 stars;Tech illiterate;I don't know much abt cord sizes, compatibility, and chargers etc. I thought this product matched the last usb-c to usb-c charger i purchased in store. It came fast and looks nice, but neither end of the 2 cords fit my phone. It was not compatible with my Galaxy S9. Will need to do more research on my end.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not the one to get if you have the NOTE 10+;So some new devices like the Note 10+ uses USB-PD charger with PPS - IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS its ok, it just means you HAVE to buy Samsung charger for right now, some on (Amazon) here will look very similar but you won't reach the speeds you want or recharge the phone at the speed its capable of reaching. This wire also doesn't meet the needs of video and super high-speed charging, you want one that says 10Gbps this one is only 480Mbps - It will work but much slower. Again, it works but not the latest and greatest and tech/devices are moving to 10Gbps USB-C. DON'T BUY!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Quick charge;Nice length
5.0 out of 5 stars;Exactly the product Iv been needing!;All features have lived up to my expectations!
5.0 out of 5 stars;great buy;I bought this to transfer my sons info from one switch to another and it worked perfectly. its super long and came with two which as nice.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Won’t last;Worked but won’t last very long (<6 weeks).
5.0 out of 5 stars;Amazing! Super durable, and perfect size :D;Awesome! It charges my ipad pro 12.9 fast, and it is super long (6 ft)! It’s also very durable :) exactly as shown in the picture! highly recommend, 10/10
2.0 out of 5 stars;The wire is strong and I fell in love with it but then;Well let me start from the beginning. They arrived well and charged very well, like super fast. But then both of the metal tip part just fell off. The first one I thought maybe I pulled too hard or too fast but I’ve been cautious cause I got tired of buying apple chargers so I knew it wasn’t me but I gave the benefit of the doubt. I said oh well this is why I got the 2 pack cause things happen.Okay, I brought out the second one since it’s a 2 pack-but it happened again. Maybe I received a defective pack? I fell in love with the look and the length but I’m just bummed the metal piece fell off and now I just have the wire with no charger.
5.0 out of 5 stars;USB-C Cables Work Great!!!;I used one of these in my office to replace the damaged OEM MacBook Pro cable. It works great on the original Mac charger. I use the 2nd cable in my car for Samsung Galaxy S10. The cable is long enough so my son can use it in the back seat if he needs to. Both cabled work great and rapid charge correctly.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Didn't last as long as hoped;I was excited about this pair, given all the excellent reviews, but they didn't last very long. The first cord lasted probably 9 months and then started charging inconsistently, then I traded it out for the other in the 2 pack, and that lasted only about 3 months. The connection to my phone feels loose, and I have to get the correct in just the right curve or it won't charge. I'm half tempted to try buying another pair because the price is so great, but will likely look elsewhere.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great cable;These cables are great so far.  I've bought from this company in the past and everything has worked great.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Prefect;Great cable
1.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped working after a few months;It has one job, and it stopped doing it after a few months.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great quality charge cable!;First off, this gets me my Super Fast Charging with my S20 which is the main reason I bought it. The cable itself is very nice, braided and seems to me made with quality in mind. Would definitely recommend this cable!
5.0 out of 5 stars;2fer Surprise!;I didn't realize I was buying a two pack! Super value for the price. I am pretty hard on charging cords so I was happy that I get a to have a spare! Works great on my Motorola Z2 Force!
5.0 out of 5 stars;This cord is great!!;I recommend this cable because its long, very sturdy and works flawlessly with my Samsung Galaxy Note 10+.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Easy to use;It works though not with every power source, hard to explain you kinda have to test to see if the charging plug is compatible with the cord or else your device won't charge. I found that out the hard way. Device sat for 2hrs uncharged.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good replacement for original cables;I had cables before that lasted ~2 years. These replacements are great for around the house because they add enough length to actually be able to use your phone and not have to stand right next to the outlet. I would definitely purchase again if I needed more cables.
3.0 out of 5 stars;They don't fit Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra with Otter box commuter series case.;The issue the aluminum fitting on each end of the cable is to large to fit into the otter box commuter case with out removing the case.  Who wants to take their case off to charge their phone.  May work on other cases but something to keep in mind.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not for IPad Pro!;Headline says it’s for iPad Pro but the prongs are too large - so don’t get this for iPad pro!Otherwise it looks like a good cable.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Well made, good length;These are a great length so you don't have to hungry over to charge your phone. The leather keeper on the cord is a little awkward to keep the cord bundled, but a nice addition
3.0 out of 5 stars;You get what you pay for;One cord worked great for about 3 weeks and stopped charging. The length was exactly what I needed and for the price I can’t complain. Hopefully the second lasts longer.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice looking cable but not great functionality.;I like the material and the length of these cables, but you need to use this cable along with an adaptor to charge your phone.  You cannot plug it directly into a USB port and charge your phone in your car...you need the adaptor and a standard plug.
4.0 out of 5 stars;good!;good!
4.0 out of 5 stars;No Issues;The cord is comically long, but it is useful. I've tripped over it which puts stress on it and there's been no issue.  There's been no issue with rapid charging either.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great product.;Really good product, exactly what I was looking for. Only wish I had bought the 100W version.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Nice, long, durable, good connectors;This cable is a great length, and still seems to charge as quickly as the shorter one I have. It is somewhat stiff, but may loosen up over time. I don't use it a ton, so it will be a while before I can tell about long term durability, but so far, so good. The connectors are nice and snug on both ends, and it works with my Essential PH-1.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great value and recommend;Solid value. Product is a described and item arrived in a timely manner.  Would purchase these again
2.0 out of 5 stars;Died @ 6 months;Used it for 6 months and the plug has died. No longer makes contact.
4.0 out of 5 stars;I mean, it charges;not much more you can ask a charger to do. good price and good quality
5.0 out of 5 stars;Fast charging/ long length;Charged battery faster than factory Google pixel cord. I still used factory power supply but with this new cable and man did it charge fast
5.0 out of 5 stars;It does it's job;It works well and does what it needs to
5.0 out of 5 stars;Can’t complain lol;So far so good. I’ve been using it to charge my 4th gen iPad Pro and it has worked great. The length is definitely a plus. I don’t have to be so close to the plug.
4.0 out of 5 stars;So far so good;I've only tried this one night. But the cable seems pretty sturdy so far.We'll see what happens
3.0 out of 5 stars;Nice alternative cord for usb;A nice cord. It doesn’t work quite as quickly as some other cords that we have. It doesn’t fray at the ends and the cord thickness is really nice. It’s plenty long as well so that isn’t an issue. Decent for the price you pay.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not Phone Case Friendly;I bought these cables to use with my Samsung Galaxy S20, but the plastic around the plug is too big for the cable to snap into the phone when I use my Otterbox Commuter case. I am going to have to shave some of the edge plastic down so that I can both protect and charge my phone.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Did NOT charge my phone;Neither worked. Returned them.  Will stick to buying from brands I know.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good durability;Very nice cables, good length and durability. It comes with two which is nice, overall very happy with them.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Heavy Duty- and Heavy!;Heavy- duty cords! (The longest one is heavy enough to pull my charger out of a loose wall socket!)
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good cable for charging;While this cable is great for charging. It will not work with my New Chevy in Andriod Auto mode. I needed to use the cable that came with the phone for it to recognize the phone and work properly as an adriod auto device and display the gps maps to the on board display in the truck. Other then this issue the cable is fine and durable.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not Durable At All - Good Seller;I thought this was a great deal to replace my original macbook charger. However both cables broke after barely two months of casual home use. Both at the same spot and it’s past exchange / refund period.It bends at the head super easy after simply plugging and unplugging it thus killing the connection.The Seller has offered to replace these cables which is generous of them. I have updated the ratings to accurately represent my experience with this product and manufacturer. I will update this review in the future if there are anymore problems.
5.0 out of 5 stars;well made, sturdy cable;I use this for charging.  It seems sturdy, and has a positive click-feel when it plush into my MacBook, so I know it is in (unlike the cable I had to replace with this one).
2.0 out of 5 stars;Sooo this happened;Started smoking!  Ruined pixel 6 pro
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works well with my macbook pro;I have no issues with the cords at all. I love the sturdiness of the cords and how long they are, I keep one at the office and one at home.
5.0 out of 5 stars;iPad users must have;Must have for any iPad user. The standard 3 foot cord doesn’t cut it. Very high quality braided cord, charges device quickly.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Did not work for me;Cables look very durable and first-class. However, for some reason, they did not work on my docking station (Hub, 2 monitors, used to connect a laptop). It's a shame because they look well-built.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Strength;So far is good
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great Value;These cables seem well built with sturdy weaving that will hopefully withstand the wear and tear. I liked that they came with velcro cable ties.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Fast charging, a bit loose with my Pixel 3a.;Works well with my Pixel 3a but it seems a bit more loose than the OEM cable that came with the phone.  Great price and seems to be well made.
5.0 out of 5 stars;As advertised;Meant to by USB type-A to type-C and got these without paying attention. These are nice cables and come with a little cable tie on them which is nice. Does handle the rapid charging when using the wall adapter that came with my Pixel 3. Does not rapid charge when using the type-C connecter out of my PC.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Quality made cable;My OEM cable had a loose connection so I ordered this. I'm pleased with the quality and durability.
4.0 out of 5 stars;rugged and fast;after the charger for my pixel 2 xl got chewed up i got this as a replacement and it is great. it supports fast charging and can get tossed around which is important with my constant travels.
5.0 out of 5 stars;A durable, good cable if only it was metal;Very durable. I kind of just picked this cable because I figured that it’ll last the longest. I was really looking for a metal cable because I have a cat but no one has made a USB-C to USB-C metal cable yet. I found a USB-C to USB metal cable but apparently the 3rd generation iPad won’t charge using a USB port.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Didn’t last long!;Stopped working after 6 mos.
3.0 out of 5 stars;good color;durability not rated since just rcvd.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good chord;Strong chord. Durable and long.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't Work Well;Only works on certain applications. Works on one dock station and NOT on another. It charges but does not allow detection of the external monitors. If you have a Lenovo system DO NOT buy these cables.
3.0 out of 5 stars;No SLIM connector;The connector is not SLIM enough to fit  my Samsung Galaxy Note 20 ultra. I have to return it
5.0 out of 5 stars;Well made;When connected to my fast charger it charges quickly. It is very sturdy and durable.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Use your discretion;Bought these and after a month they both stopped working.
4.0 out of 5 stars;It's ok;Good price
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great value, great quality!;Fast charging cable! High quality!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great replacement USB-C cable for iPad;Replaced USB-C cable on a 6 month old iPad.Works great. Seems sturdy and it's significantly cheaper than the one in the big box store.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Quit working;Worked well at first , then quit working.  Won't charge the macbook.  Had to go back to the old cable while I pick out a different cord .
5.0 out of 5 stars;Charge;Worked well
4.0 out of 5 stars;Looks great;Look good and durable. Packaging of the cords was nice, I like the velceo tie that comes on them.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Well built! In fact even stronger than I expected;I used these cables for direct data transfer and they are very well built. I'm very pleased with these cables. THANK YOU!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped working after 2 months;"The media could not be loaded.
                



 Stopped working after 2 months. I hardly used the cable. I’ve only used it twice a day and it gave out after 2 months. Nothing seems to be broken and it looked like a great quality cable. All of a sudden I hear my device charging sound over and over."
1.0 out of 5 stars;Defective, caused my phone to power down every few minutes.;Was using this to charge my phone (wanted a distinct color) but the cable was no good and repeatedly caused my phone to crash / power down for safety.
3.0 out of 5 stars;"Don't work anymore; great customer service";You get what you pay for,  I guess.  I bought this in April and the first one when out in June. The second wire goes in and out of working and I'm sure it won't work by the end of the month.Update: Upgraded to 3 stars based on three great customer service.  I was offered a free replacement or a refund after my first review. I don't know how long it'll last, but I'll update again.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Did not last very long.;I love a long phone charging cord so that I can work on my phone as it's charging. This product works for a few months and then it stops working I enjoyed it while it lasted but probably won't purchase again.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Fast charge but not sturdy;Charges super fast but falls out the port. I have to literally hold it in if I want to use the phone while charging. Since the charge is fast, I'm only holding it for about thirty minutes. But still.... and you get two so I guess it's worth it.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Company stands behind their product!;The cables are very nice and durable. They are rugged and the company responded to a concern I had and rectified  the situation immediately. Highly recommended. Liked it so much I bought another set!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Nice cable;:)
2.0 out of 5 stars;Started off Great;I got the two pack and thank God I did!! When I started using the cable it changed fast and the length is great even though I didn't need it that long. However, after of just a few months of use it simple stop working. I didn't damage it or gotten it wet, it just stopped working. So now I'm using the second cable and I hope this one can last longer than a few months.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Received;Incorrect recipient delivered to us, so we’re good. Thanks.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Super sturdy and cute;High quality,  sturdy, and charges my phone quickly!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good buy;Just as expected
1.0 out of 5 stars;Only lasted 3 months;One of these cords stopped working in 3 months of purchase. Nothing broken, nothing bent, nothing spilled it. The two days leading up to it not working for good, my Note8 phone kept showing that it only getting intermittent charging. I thought something was wrong with my phone. I couldn't imagine that this cable had absolutely no issues prior and we have only had it a short time. My wife told me the next day that it wouldn't charge her Galaxy at all. I checked my phone and nada. My next instinct was that something was wrong with the power charger. I swapped the other cord in the 2 pack out with it and nothing was wrong. It charged. They aren't bad cords if they work. My issue could be anomaly. Just adding this review for posterity, maybe help others if the defective one's start piling up and I just bought a 3 pack of a different brand. I love how quick C to C cables charge. It would charge my Lenovo Yoga quickly wile it was in use when the cable worked.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Charges fast;Charges fast so far so good......
3.0 out of 5 stars;Okay product. Doesn't last long;The cord length was great but after a while one stopped working and the other doesn't charge as well
5.0 out of 5 stars;I love its construction!;Works just fine. I've had it for 3 months now.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Work good.;Woork good .
5.0 out of 5 stars;Such a Steal!!;When I ordered these I felt like they would be too good to be true but they are flipping amazing! And such a steal! And you get TWO of them?! Great quality, long, thick, bendable works PERFECT with my new iPad Pro 12.9! I will absolutely be ordering from them again!!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice cable, strictly a power cable;Nice but, strictly a power cable
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not a true USB-C cable;A USB-C should work regardless of how you plug it in, but this one has a right way and a wrong way.  Half the time I think I'm charging, but then I have to reverse the plug.  When it works, it is fairly 'fast', but it's unpredictability makes it a mediocre charger and I've had much better.  The only really great thing about it is the length.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Only Lasted 4 Months;This charger was great at first and charged my phone well.  However after 4 months it seems the connector part of the charger has become loose and it rarely charges well.  When it does I have to make sure not to move anything, phone or charger, or else the connection is lost and i have to find the exact position it works for.The durability is not as advertised.  Not worth the hassle, look elsewhere.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not reversible;I returned one set because at least one of the 2 was not working. The replacements don't work right either. The c type usb should be reversible and they aren't! Both ends have to be aligned a certain way or they don't charge at all. It could be that they aren't compatible with my LG phone, but I haven't had this issue with any other cables.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Quality;Works perfect for a reasonable price.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great cable!;Great cable. Way better than the one you get from Apple.  And I love that it’s long enough for me to have my iPad Pro plugged in while working at my desk.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Broke within 3 months;These look and charge great but the first broke within a week and the second just broke today around 3 months after purchase. Nothing is made for longevity anymore but 3 months is really pushing it.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Liked it;Good cable. Charging not fast but not slow
5.0 out of 5 stars;Came with two cables c type;Only was expecting one c type cable but in reality you're paying for two. Good surprise
5.0 out of 5 stars;The length is great!;Great value. I would buy these cords again.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Charging time;My phone charges very fast
1.0 out of 5 stars;Did not charge anything.;Neither cable charges any of my devices.  I'm very disappointed, I was looking forward to the extra charging length.
3.0 out of 5 stars;I have this in my ArsenalGood Product;With a windows pc  I think I have to go with an Ez  Zip Micro
4.0 out of 5 stars;Before you buy;Know that this is a Male to Male USBC, for whatever that is used for. I ordered by mistake, hopefully, this will help you.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped working after 3 months;It worked great at first, powerful charging. However, after about 3 months the connection became lose and it stopped working reliably. Now the connection is lose and it stops charging every few seconds.
1.0 out of 5 stars;They don't charge;Every one of these cables doesn't charge. I have to keep wiggling the cable to get the charge to start and then I have to constantly wiggle it to keep it charging. It's not my phone because other cables work fine.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works perfect;Exactly as described.  Works perfect!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Sturdy;It fit my 2020 IPad Pro and seems sturdy.  Only time will tell for sure
5.0 out of 5 stars;Solid USB-C to USB-C Cable;Have been using these cables for appx. two months so far.  Pleasantly surprised at how good they are.  Excellent high speed charging.  Construction seems solid without the cables being overly stiff.  Color and braiding are well-done.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not as advertised;It says 60w on the description but charging my M1 MBA still takes a couple of hours from 20 to 80%. Really not that great.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Durable;Seems to be a reliable cord and is holding up well
5.0 out of 5 stars;The Best Quality;I love it!!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Don't buy this cable;I have a Google Pixel 3 XL, a Motorola G7 power, various other devices. Three separate power delivery chargers and two turbochargers (Motorola's variant of fast charging) have connection issues with this cable. Both cables I received have connection issues and you have to put something on the cable to apply A small directional force so it will make a connection with any of the phones or tablets I have. Other cables do not do this. I purchased this cable specifically because it was longer than the other cables I had and because of its price. Do not buy this cable if you intend to use it for data transfer or charging. Turbocharging and power delivery 1.3 appeared to work, if of course you could get the cable connected. It just really does not want to connect unless a small amount of force is applied indicating that the cables build quality is insufficient.This is a strong recommendation to find another cable. At least until they're quality control issues have been fixed.
3.0 out of 5 stars;good charging cable, dont use for data;got the cables in, tried to use my phone as a wired hot spot and is consistently dropping the connection. i have to unplug and plug back in to get data back. as a charging cable it has the ability to quick charge my pixel 2 just fine. if you are looking for a data cable i would suggest a thunderbolt cable if your laptop can handle it.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Will NOT work on Lenovo laptop for data transfer;I purchased this to have a longer version of the one that came with my Lenovo USB-c docking station. It will charge, but will not transfer data to my monitors and will not work as a network connector. My original Lenovo cable does this. I am not giving it a one star since it does work as a charger, but feel the product information should state this type of usage is not possible.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Worked as expected;Worked as expected
3.0 out of 5 stars;5 months later, only 1 works;They were great at first but after 5 months, the one I used most no longer works. Doesn't seem to be anything wrong with it and the other one still charges my phone (for now). Hard to recommend though since they don't seem to be too long lasting. Spend a little more and go with a company that has a lifetime warranty, like Anker
5.0 out of 5 stars;Quite substantial;The biggest surprise was how substantial the wire is on these. The length is great and it's bulkier than the USB-C to USB cables I've used previously. It's much sturdier than the cable that came with the phone.
2.0 out of 5 stars;wrong Usb type;Unable to use purchased wrong type usb C to usb C
3.0 out of 5 stars;Works, kinda.;This product will work as long as your device is not in any type of case. The ends are too fat to fit through standard USB-C openings. I have to remove my iPad from its case each time I want to use this cable.....frustrating. Other than larger than standard end size, the cable seems sturdy and does work with high speed chargers.
4.0 out of 5 stars;C to C;Seems like a good product. Well made and durable . I think it's fine and time will tell.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Possibly not safe?;I can not definitively say (if at all) that the cables were responsible, but 2 days after using these cables my Macbook logic board fried. Only thing that changed in my setup is using these cables.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not Fast Charging;"This cord does not carry enough current for ""Fast Charging"". Otherwise it's a great cord."
3.0 out of 5 stars;The cords ultimately failed;The cords are very attractive and flexible, as well as being good length choices, and the price was right.  However, after a few months they started to fail--first intermittently and later permanently.  I'm sorry they didn't work out better for me & my husband.  I'm not accustomed to ordeeing things through Amazon that don't perform well.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Electrocuted and questioning safety;The cord seems really durable and I like the length. It did a good job of charging my phone (I made sure to get an appropriate adapter and everything) but I don't think I will continue using it as today I took my phone off the charger then accidentally leaned my leg on the part that goes in the phone and it zapped me. Not super painful or anything but enough to be concerned about its safety being plugged in
3.0 out of 5 stars;dont buy;great product for a short period of time works great in a pinch but is not relible
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great;Great product.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Its okay.;Charges 0 to 100 percent in 2h 20m.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Connector comes loose;These work as long as I'm not holding my phone, but any movement at all causes the cord to disconnect just enough to not charge the phone.  A number of nights I've plugged my phone in and then set it down only to wake up to a dead phone because the cable came unplugged.  I don't have this issue with other cables which stay connected much better.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped working after a year.;Been using for a year. No visible damage. Looks brand new. No fraying. But it just stopped working after a year.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great!;Cords are very long and sturdy.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works will.;Works as advertised.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped working in 2 months;Liked it a lot until it stopped working. I was using it a lot. However I would have thought though it would last more than a couple months. It doesn’t look worn or frayed. Just stopped working. Other cables work - not the device.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great quality charging cable.;These cables work well for charging my laptop from my solar panels.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Just what we needed;The length is a little too long for us, but still very useful.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Does not fit into charging port with Otter Box case.;"I bought this charging cable with an Otter Box commuter case. The plug will not fit into the charging port with the case on. It is needlessly large on both ends of the cable. (The stock charging cable does fit nicely into the port with the case on.It does charge at the ""super fast charge"" rate which is nice. But seeing as I will have to remove the case to use the cord it will most likely sit in storage as a backup."
5.0 out of 5 stars;Fast and quick charge capable !;Held up to it's claim of power delivery! Can Quick charge and Fast Charge both my S8+ and Pixel 3aXL. Cable is super sturdy and long! I would recommend these without a doubt
5.0 out of 5 stars;.;Nice and durable
3.0 out of 5 stars;stopped working after 1 month;I really liked this cord at first but after one month of having it, it just stopped working for me... sorry but I have to give it 3 stars...
2.0 out of 5 stars;Only 1 works;Only one of the chargers works.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Only got 1/2 charging cords;So this has been great but I just realized it’s was a 2 pack and I only received one :/
3.0 out of 5 stars;Useful but cheap;Not durable
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good price;Long cord great
5.0 out of 5 stars;Nice cable.;Seems like a very well made cable. I have one at home and one at work.
3.0 out of 5 stars;One came broken...;One of the wires came broken, didn't charge anything but the other was working as it should.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Worked until it didn't;Got this for my phone and it worked great at first... After a few months the cable only chargedy phone if I held it in a certain way. Other USB C cables do not have this issue with my phone. Comparing it to other cables, the metal housing appears smaller and thus makes it looser and not charge your device. Maybe I got a defective unit.
4.0 out of 5 stars;great usb c to usb c cable;Reliable and durable.
5.0 out of 5 stars;;
2.0 out of 5 stars;The first cord stopped working after 5 weeks.;The charging power was good, it charged my phone quickly. Cord length was also good. I was very disappointed that one of the two cords just stopped working after 4 weeks of very limited use. Not what I expected to happen so quickly.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Great at first, now doesn't work;So I was very pleased at first with these charging cables. I love having the 6' length so I can place my phone on my nightstand instead of on my bed. I have barely had these for a month and already one of the charging cables took a dump. I did troubleshoot and place the cable in another outlet and another charging port, and it is the cable itself. Great concept but poor results. Very disappointed.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works great;Works great for our pixel 2 and lgv30 and it does rapid charge#
1.0 out of 5 stars;RUN AWAY.  Damaged both my charging ports that I tried it on;I tried this on two different charging ports to connect to my phone. Now neither of them work.  Thank goodness at least my phone port still seems to work. A simple return of my money isn't good enough... RUN AWAY
5.0 out of 5 stars;Satisfied!;Heavy duty, good quality
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not durable for the long-term.;It worked well, until it didn't. Purchased July 30, 2020 and worked fine until recently. The past month, I would have to reseat the plug intoy Pixel 4a, but it would eventually work. Now, reg2of how many times I insert it, it will not work.It would be a solid product, but just not with long-term durability.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't last long;Already is shorting out.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not secure on my MacBook Pro. Tight fit on phone.;The cable did not hold secure to MacBook Pro tighly enough. It worked fine on my Samsung 10plus and 10e.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not worth the money;Not worth the buy. Charges my iPad Pro very very slow! Plugged in to charge my iPad and 30 minutes later it had charged 2%!!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Lasted a year, nuff said;Durability is crap. Both cords lasted a year. Yes they're the length and color advertised and yes while they worked they charged my phone. Bottom line they don't work for very long and these cables were kept in the same location the entire time I owned them. I'll never buy this brand again. This is a PRIME example why you should never review items until you have a chance to use them for reasonable amount of time. The good thing is you're permitted to rewrite reviews and I originally gave these cords 4 stars suggesting I'd be back to rereview this item.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Stiff but good;A little stiffer than my old ones but still good quality.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Terrible;Very beautiful but the first cable broke in less than a month
1.0 out of 5 stars;Cable ends are loose;Cables don't make good connection with anything. Constantly glitches. Don't buy.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Dependable;I love these cords. I have multiple sets for work, home, and vehicle. I also purchase these for my daughters' phone and all her tech items.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great cable for a good price;Very durable cable.  Works great with the new ipad.  No issues at all when using it for charging.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good stuff;So far so good love the length, and so does she... Plus the tip doesn't go south 😂
5.0 out of 5 stars;Does the job;No issue
5.0 out of 5 stars;Just like my Samsung charger, just not so short!;Works perfectly with my Samsung S20+
5.0 out of 5 stars;It's a good priced cable that works;Cable does the job perfectly. No issues so far from the time I've been using it.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Will not support an external monitor thru docking station usb-c to usb-c connection;This cable will CHARGE your devices. but it does NOT support a USB-C to USB-C connection when you are looking for it to connect an external monitor thru your docking station.  (the docking station does not recognize monitor when I use this cable)
4.0 out of 5 stars;Very attractive looking and sturdy. Well made.;Didn't work with my S8.Worked for my friend's G6
1.0 out of 5 stars;Its great but badddlyy service;But they charge soooo slow and one of them doesn't even work so I only use it for 5 days and it stopped working but ig its gud to have 2 but it still charge slow
5.0 out of 5 stars;It fit.;It showed up on time, both ends fit, both ends work. I'd say that's a 5 star!
2.0 out of 5 stars;! of 2 cables stopped working;I used the cable for about a couple of weeks before I noticed my phone would say it is not charging. I would disconnect and reconnect the cable and would start charging for a couple minutes and then stop again. I plugged then went back and used the stock usb c cable that came with my Xperia 1 ii and my phone was able to charge normally again.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not what it claim.;It's not a quick charging cable as I expect like the one that comes with the Note 10, just a regular charging cable. But it does appear to be more stronger than a regular charging cable.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great for Powerbanks/Adpaters that are USB-C output.;Great if you have a Powerbank/adapter that supports 3A when charging. Charges my OnePlus 6 super fast compared to just the normal usb a to USB c cable.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Yum;Decent enough for my user
3.0 out of 5 stars;Too thick;The cable housing that surrounds the metal is wya too thick. With the case on my phone I really have to force it in between the case opening in order for it to fit.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Seemed good quality but didn't last;Close to 4 months in one of the cords already went out. Was really excited before this because it's thick and a great length. Disappointed in it only lasting less than 4 months.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Good cables, but interferes with S20 case;I love almost everything about this, but the fact that the extra metal layer around the plug interferes with the case on my S20 is an immediate deal breaker. If your case has plenty of room around the charging port, then these are probably great cables to choose, but for me, I'll have to find something without that extra bell and whistle.
4.0 out of 5 stars;No issues with this product;No complaints
1.0 out of 5 stars;have to take your phone case off to use;"I have a thin case and you still have to remove it or these fall out constantly.  This was a 3rd set I've bought from yet another company hoping they would have considered that most everybody like 99.9% use a phone case.  I""m sure the cord quality is 5 star. But sorry doing 1 start in hopes they see it and think about designing more user-friendly items. It's annoying that no one can make an end that is just slightly longer or state that ""this model can be used with a phone case on."""
1.0 out of 5 stars;Some last days, weeks or months.  You never know what you're getting;Some last days, weeks or months.  You never know what you're getting
4.0 out of 5 stars;Ok;To slow to charge
5.0 out of 5 stars;Double C’s for the newest iPad Pro.;Love the color, they are sturdy and well made for the money! The double C’s are still hard to find for the newest iPad, these work great!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Fast Charger;Really happy with this purchase. It charges really fast.
1.0 out of 5 stars;STOP CHARGING IPAD PRO;I've tried a few third party charging cables out there mainly to get the longer 6'+ not offered by Apple.However, this cable could rank as the worse I've experienced and I'm not sure if that was because i was charging an iPad Pro or not.I saw where the cable was charging my iPad, but stopped charging for no known reason.This would more normally happen after a lot of wear and tear on the cable, but these were brand new.The good thing is, i was still in the product return period and was able to get a refund.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Cat proof;It's cat proof! My silly cat thinks phone cords are for eating and thankfully this isn't one he is interested in. Seems very durable.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped working within a few months;At first, it seemed like a good product but one cable died after only 4 months. I contacted customer service but got no reply. I can't find any information about the warranty on their website,vsobi guess there isn't any warranty. Buyer beware!Had they responded and offered to replace the defective product, I would have given them a good review.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Durability Failed;Cable is falling apart. not a good quality.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works great;Keeps the phone charged to full when using it as a hot spot(big power draw)
2.0 out of 5 stars;Works well for 3-4  months;The cables work well for  3-4 months however they are not very durable. The connecters loose strength and you have to constantly wiggle the cables to regain connection/charge until they're useless, both cables had the same issue after only 3-4 months of use with a Macbook
2.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't fast charge;Doesn't 25w fast charge my s21 u
5.0 out of 5 stars;Exceeded expectations;Very heavy and durable. Met all my expectations.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Solid, works as expected;Bought in tandem with a USB-C to Lightning adapter for fast charging an iPhone, and it works! USB PD spec is accurate.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not slim enough to fit my phone case.;The cable is not small enough to fit through my phone's case, so I'll only be using it for my Nintendo Switch. I added a picture comparing an Asus charger with this one.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Lifespan;September 12, 2021 I bought this item, it came with two cords 10' ea and between 02-03 I noticed one of them stopped working.
2.0 out of 5 stars;They work well when they work;They worked well and I would recommend them but it's already faulting on and I have only had these for 6 months... Wish they were more durable!
3.0 out of 5 stars;So-so;There ok, the only complaint I have is that after some regular usage they will fall out of your phone and not charge. This has happened to me and multiple occasions. I personally wouldn't buy these again because of this.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Price;Works
3.0 out of 5 stars;Short durability;Stopped working after a month of usage
1.0 out of 5 stars;Buy from a name brand;"I should take my own advice.  These cables look and act very well built.  However, they do not function like true 60W 3 amp cables.  After noticing my 2016 MBP 13"" slow charging and needing my battery replaced I asked the local technician to check my cables.  The first was pulling .3 amps and the 2nd .5 amps.  They should be pulling 3 amps.  Thus, my slow charge.  I went back to the more expensive Apple cable.  So while they are durable and sturdy my experience has been the do not perform as well for my particular hardware setup"
1.0 out of 5 stars;Lasted less than 2 months;I was using this cord to charge my iPad.  It was fine until it just stopped working after only a couple months.  I was hoping that this type of cord would be more durable than the all plastic Apple cords, but it turned out to be even worse.  Don’t waste your money.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Power draw is an issue;This cable is (occasionally) able to draw the max (30W) from an Anker power brick I own, but can only draw 15-30W from my 61W Apple power brick, even though the manufacturer says that the cables should be able to deliver 60W.  Not sure why, but be wary if you intend to use this cable with a 2020 Macbook Pro.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Look elsewhere;Cables fail quickly and charging time is long even with a strong head unit. Not worth the price.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Grest;Quality product
2.0 out of 5 stars;Disappointed;"Not a well fit with my note 9. Fits loosely, need to find ""the sweet spot"" for it to work. Purchased a different brand that works great."
2.0 out of 5 stars;Lasts 2.5 month only;At first it seemsed very high quality but after using 2.5 month, the cable had a problem, on and off.You think the device is charged but later find out not charged at all.Do not recommend the cable.  Price is very good not quality.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Will buy again;Perfect extra cable for my iPad Pro and I can tell they will last
4.0 out of 5 stars;USB C cable.;So far pretty good cable.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Nice cable, but doesn't charge the Surface Go tablet.;I bought these to charge my Surface Go off the USB-C port on my Macbook Pro, but it doesn't carry enough power to do so. Otherwise, they're really nicely constructed cables and the length is great.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Very stiff;The way this cable is sleeved, it makes it hard to move around, and is prone to being permanently bent. For a long phone charger, the point is to be able to have a little more freedom with your movement as your phone is plugged in, however the way this product is manufactured, its hard to do even that. The wire itself is quite durable, however the durability of the ends are very weak. I don't understand why they made the part that has the most stress the least durable part, but what do I know.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Only can be used for charging;Cannot connect my phone to my car with these. They're only good for charging. Data transfer keeps shorting out and crashing apps on my phone and in the car's UConnect.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Very good;Perfect
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great USB Cables;Great Cables.  Great price.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not a great option for charging cord.;Lasted just short of two months before the plug end started shorting out. I have to move the cord just the right way to keep a connection.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great value;Great value for the money! Sturdy, well constructed cables that should last more than a few years if they don't get used for boot laces.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great price.;I will continue to buy these. My boxer puppy is the only reason I have needed more
1.0 out of 5 stars;0 stars. Bad. Loose fit, hard to charge;"They fit too loose with my phone. The ""good one"" i have to set just right and maybe it starts charging, and forget about using it while charging. That's too much movement. The 2nd one is absolutely worthless."
2.0 out of 5 stars;Transfers at speeds of USB2;+ Very nice quality braided cable.+ Strong well built ends+ Makes a great charging cable.- Transfer speeds promised were over 400mbs but it only gets 30mb/s (280mbs).  This is USB2 speeds not Type-C speeds.  The cable is a gimmick.  If you plan on using it ONLY for charging I guess it is fine.  But considering it is Type-C on both ends, that is not likely.  I gave it a two stars because the description lied.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not 60w;Definitely not the advertised 60W. Measured with my meter with a load similar to that of charging my phone and didn't get the 69 watts. The connectors also bent and broke some pins very easily.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Intermittent charging;I purchased this cable in March 2020.  After 9 months, the cable will not charge intermittently.  The wires must be broken.  It is unreliable.  The cable should be 5 stars, but not if only lasts 9 months.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Big flaw;The product works, but only when my phone is out of the case. The housing for the C port is so big it will not fit into the port while my phone case is on. Very inconvenient. 😒
2.0 out of 5 stars;NOT FOR DATA or VIDEO;Will not support data or video. A standard cord supports charging and data. These are the 2 primary functions of a cable. This lack of major features is not explicitly stated anywhere. Its called a BAIT and SWITCH.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn’t last 6 months;Works for a while but after not-so-regular use, they have both failed on me. I should have just gotten better quality I guess
5.0 out of 5 stars;It's 3 yo proof so far;My 3 year old hasn't destroyed it...yet. It has outlasted all previous charging cables so far.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great cables. Love the fabric covering;Very nice cables. I added leather cable ties. Use every day. They work great
2.0 out of 5 stars;Didn't work with my Galaxy S21;"They should delete the ""A"" in the brand name because J-SUX is a better description. Doesn't fit my Galaxy S21 well at all. Iffy connection"
2.0 out of 5 stars;One good and one bad charging cable;I had to give 2 stars because out of the 2 cords I received one of them didn't work. The other one works fine and charges fast. Too much hassle to send back n wait to receive another. These cables should be tested before shipping out.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Quit Working;Received the 2 pack on 12/05/20. I have only used one since. Well it no longer charges my phone already. Like it doesn't fit secure in the charge port anymore......
5.0 out of 5 stars;Better than good;Plug it in and charge your device.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't stay in my phone.;Constantly falling out of my phone, complete disappointment.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great cord.;Very sturdy cord, would buy again.
5.0 out of 5 stars;They work;They are much sturdier than I expected!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Lasted over a month;One of the cables lasted over a month, not charging anymore. I had cheap gas station cables lasting longer than that.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect;Perfect, no problems  As advertised.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Excellent Quality;... and even comes with Velcro cable ties.  I will look to this seller for future cables.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Does not fit well;Need to try different way of plugging in, until it works in one specific position. Every time you plug and unplug it, need to do this exercise to find the right position.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Keep disconnecting as usb c to usb c thunderbolt data to HP Spectre 360;My original intention was to connect my galaxy S8 plus to HP Spectre 360 thunderbolt/usb c port.  Assuming this can make date transfer quicker.  However, I founded this only let my phone charge via the thunderbolt. but keep disconnecting and reconnecting to my PC (win 10 pro).  PC never able to detect the S8 as an attached device at all.  Failed as data cable for my intended use.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Hasn't held up;First one did not hold up well. 2nd cord is in use now
2.0 out of 5 stars;The cord broke too soon;The cord lasted no longer than OEM apple cord and oddly comes apart at the head of the cord if you push hard enough... It's not one unit.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Died after less than 5 months of use.;The cable became unreliable after less than 5 months of use.  No fraying or signs of wear, it just stopped working.  I could wiggle it and it would charge for about 5 seconds but that was it.  Yes I verified that it was the cable and not the device or power plug.Its supposed to have an 18 month warranty but I can't figure out how to make a claim.
3.0 out of 5 stars;buy two get one;received two, one stopped working after a few weeks. otherwise fast and sturdy.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Bad connection.;I used it for connecting to my drone remote.  However, from time tontime the conection would fail.  Mabe a lemon
5.0 out of 5 stars;Excellent product;Solid and reliable.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn’t fully work with laptop to docking station;I bought to replace a lost one for connecting to a laptop to docking station for work. It works for all (internet, all accessories) expect connecting to monitors. So I need to buy a better brand or different version
1.0 out of 5 stars;Don't buy this for your Macbook Pro;"Bought it for my Macbook Pro (2019, 16-inch). This power cable sucks. It did NOT charge my battery! In fact, my power almost went to ZERO on this. My battery icon at top of screen said ""not charging.""Avoid this cable for your Mac! I'm buying a higher quality $18 cable instead."
2.0 out of 5 stars;NOT FOR MACBOOK PRO 16!;charger cable works great and is durable, i purchased it for my MacbookPro and it cause battery issues. new MBP's use 96w, this cable only supplies 60w. Just an FYI for anyone looking to use on Apple products.
5.0 out of 5 stars;It's a good match for the fast charging adapter;It's a good match for the fast charging adapter.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Fried my phone;Seemed to work for several months, then out of nowhere fried my phone. We didn't know it was the cord, so I tried using it on my replacement phone. Fried it before I even got it set up. I was suspicious at that point, but instead of a cord, we thought maybe the power base, so we got a new one from Verizon. I was nervous so I used a different cord and my husband used mine in a different power base. His phone is fried. I will be returning the replacement cords I ordered yesterday and have ordered new ones from Verizon to be on the safe side.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Dead after 6 months;This cord worked great for 6 months, then it wouldn't charge anything. Luckily it came with two cords. I plan to move on to a different brand when the second one gives out.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Quick Charge;The cord is sturdy but still flexible. It charges alot faster then my old one.
3.0 out of 5 stars;No longevity;These worked great for 4 months and suddenly stopped working. No frays or cuts just stopped working.
5.0 out of 5 stars;A must!;Use Daily and VERY well made!!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great price;Oh ya high quality version pleased
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not durable at all - broke after 1 month;"This cable worked fine... For about a month. Then it conked out and now charges my phone for 2 seconds, then turns off for 2 seconds, rinse, repeat. The end result is that my phone doesn't charge at all and is unusable while it's on the cable because the screen keeps lighting up and it keeps buzzing to indicate ""now charging.""I know 10 foot cables tend to break sooner, but I got this in mid-August and it broke JUST after the 1 month return window ended. Not a good experience."
2.0 out of 5 stars;Buyer beware;I was very disappointed with the product. One of them didn’t work!
3.0 out of 5 stars;One out of two worked properly.;One of the cables had a fualty connection right out of the box.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Won't fit charging port to some cell phone cases;If you have a lifetime style case it might not fit the charging port. Something to think about. Other than that no complaints
2.0 out of 5 stars;Reliability is questionable;This cable worked great for a few weeks until the connector became somewhat loose
5.0 out of 5 stars;Quality charger;Works as advertised. Would buy again
5.0 out of 5 stars;Cables work as advertised;Quality of cables made them well worth the price.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Works for a few months.;Not sure how long these are expected to work but mine stopped working after light use. I may have used these cords to charge my phone once a week (backup cords), after 8 months they no longer work. I'm glad I didn't spend that much for them.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Can't use as intended.;Slips off. Can't use with phone case for s20 ultra. If original charger wouldn't fit either I wouldn't be complaining but it charges perfectly.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Don’t waste your money.;Worked for a little bit, very well, then only works at certain angles. No, I did not do anything to it, I barely even use it.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Works but not great;Wow yes technically Discord works it does not fast charge my phone and only reason why I did not give  a five star review
1.0 out of 5 stars;Unfortunately broke right after the warranty!;This is a great usb-c cablePros1. Snug fit, sturdy - it fits really well compared to the other cables I have had in the past.2. Durable - The material is of good quality and seems like it will last long.3. Length - The cable is long. I had a 2 ft cable previously and this one is really long which is helpful.ConsNoneUpdate-01/21 - unfortunately  the cable works intermittently and I am past 18 month warranty period. I an unable to get In touch with customer service and experience has been disappointing to say the least!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Broken in less than 1 year;Been using the cable for less than a year and it often will not charge unless the cable is positioned a certain way due to some loose connection in the cable itself. Has left me with an uncharged phone in the morning a few times!Don't waste your money!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Does not power my Philips PicoPix Max;Philips says it needs 60W to power their mini projector. I bought this cable because of that advertised capability, but after connecting, it would not power up my projector. I replaced it with a CableMatters 20gpbs cable, which works perfectly.
2.0 out of 5 stars;It was good until it wasn't!;Well... It was good... Until it wasn't. And then it was unusable! Purchased 1/18/19 Deceased 5//4/19 I expect at least a year out of my phone chords and then usually the cause of death is that the wires got bent up from my phone being used while charging. This was even the side plugged into the power adapter!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped working 1 month after use;This order came with two cables. The first cable stopped working after 1 month, it appears that there's some kind of short in the wire that prevents charging. I immediately grabbed the second cable and started using that one, but it has the exact same problem! These cables are junk!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Seems like quality control is not great;I bought a couple of these to have a cable for my new audio interface plus a backup. After a few days, the first one started producing blue screens and kernel panics. After swapping this cable out for another I had laying around, the problem went away. Not great. Returned them as it didn't seem worth the potential for more uncertainty and unreliability trying the second one out.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Trash cable;Worked great at first, but both stopped working. They were not abused
1.0 out of 5 stars;Briefly okay....;Worked great for a few weeks.  Now both cords are junk.  The terminals are crappy and have to be juuuuust right.  IE one of the cables is now 'directional' as in, it only works when logo on terminal is not visible, if i flip the connection to be able to see the connection, nothing happens.  On the other cable, which i have used even less, the terminals seem ok but the charging is WILDLY intermittent, on/off/on/off every second or two.
3.0 out of 5 stars;They work, but are really stiff;Work, but man...  stiff as a coat hanger!  They work ok, but the stiffness makes them annoying.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Works for a bit but wouldn't recommend.;Lasted about a little under a year before they stopped charging.  One was used very seldomly the other was used daily. They weren't twisted or contorted in any strange way. Physically they look fine but they will not connect with my Google pixel 3 anymore.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works great.;Fast charger works as advertised.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Would buy again.;Nice cords that work with iPad Pro.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works great every time!;I use these for work and have no complaints.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Crap Cable. Will not stay plugged into phone.;Just got these in the mail today (two days late). Was still excited to try them out on my Pixel 3a. Plug one end into the standard Pixel USBC charging port and then plugged the other end to my Pixel 3a. And that's when I learned the cable is crap. The cable end WILL NOT stay connected to my phone. It just falls right out. I don't have this problem with the Amazon Basics Cable. Very disappointed. Cannot recommend. Cannot even use without manually pressing it in.
1.0 out of 5 stars;no longer works;Only had this for almost 3 months and now it no longer works. Stay away from this product.
2.0 out of 5 stars;😔😔😔;One of my chords isn't working very disappointing cause I needed both of them
5.0 out of 5 stars;cable is braided.;much more maleable than regular Apple cable
5.0 out of 5 stars;Quality cable;Excellent product. Good quality good price
2.0 out of 5 stars;Mix review;One cable worked fine and the other was broken upon arrival.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Only use for charging, DOES NOT TX DATA!;Got the cables & was pretty excited to use it for my portable laptop monitor. It uses USB-C to USB-C to tx both power & data. These cables will charge & are decent quality for travel/durability, but they do not work for data at all.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Delivered from. Junkyard;Did they ship from a junk yard? Open box with couple of cables tucked inside a box, box is as if it’s picked up from a bunch of trash. You can see the picture and tell how dirty that box is. I didn’t pay for a piece of junk!!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't work reliably;POS won't hold a connection to charge. I know it's not the brick or phone since this cable is just a replacement for the factory cable I lost.
1.0 out of 5 stars;One cord stopped charging after a handful of times & on vacation, too!;Had to go get another cord for my iPad and it cost me much more than these two. Was looking forward to both of them being good (how hard is it to put together a good working, solid cable?).
1.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped working after very little use;These cables are crap, they work fine for a while and then stop working at all.  Not durable, do not buy.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Very good power cord;Exactly as duscribed
1.0 out of 5 stars;Bad cable.;One was DOA and the other died after a few weeks.  I think I just got a bad batch, oh well stuff happens.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works great. Cheap. Good Quality;Works great. Cheap. Good Quality
1.0 out of 5 stars;Broke in 2 weeks;Stopped charging after 2 weeks. Tried other cables on the same power source and had no issue.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Pass;Right length, super sturdy, well made but is NOT fast charge. It charges MUCH slower than the OEM cord, which was to be expected, but also a lot slower than a mini-USB with a USB-C adapter. A charge of my Pixel 3 from 10% to 50% took over an hour.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn’t charge my Apple device..throws error;I’m one of the unfortunate that when out of the box it would not charge and actually threw an error ..telling me it’s not compatible. They seem to be built well but sending them back as they are no good to me with Apple..
5.0 out of 5 stars;Excelente;Me parece bien
1.0 out of 5 stars;Junk;Bought two of these to charge my 2019 MacBook Pro. One stopped charging after about a month of moderate use. The other one lasted about 3 months and then also failed. Now they are both in the trash. What a waste of time and money!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Work good but careful with build quality;These arrived quickly and function as expected, however mine stopped working pretty quickly. The cover that connects to the end of the wire came loose.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't work at all;I connected my device to a charging brick and to my laptop also and neither one could charge using either of the cables I bought.  Worthless.
1.0 out of 5 stars;It didn’t work;It didn’t work, needs to be returned
5.0 out of 5 stars;Very long cable that works great.;Very long cable that works great.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Too stiff.;I don’t consider “sturdiness” a measure for a cable. Durability is the measure. This cable is too stiff. Not sure what would happen if it got kinked significantly. Too be durable it should be strong in tension, flexible, and robust contact.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great;Charges fast
1.0 out of 5 stars;One wire faulty after little use. Makes it useless. Got 2.;"The media could not be loaded.
                



 One wire is fine but the other one got faulty very quickly"
2.0 out of 5 stars;Will eventually break;Worked pretty well for about 3 months. Then crapped out, both cables too. Friend had the same experience. Seen pretty regular usage as well, been sitting on my bedside and plugging in every night, not a lot of time spent in my bag or anything.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Worked at first;I've had these cords for about a month now. At first I thought they were great, I loved the price and how long they were. However after just a month of use one of the cords is no longer working.
2.0 out of 5 stars;One of the cables were bad;One of the cables didn't function right. The cable would charge my phone til 100% then it would stop charging it. Swapped cables to the other one and it would keep my phone charged at 100%. So basically I paid for one good cable...
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not working;Great cord length but only lasted a year. Doesn't charge right any more.
1.0 out of 5 stars;They don’t last long;I purchased these cables in November, I used them for 3 months. Cables are in perfect condition but they won’t charge.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Cable no longers charges after one year;After one year of continued use charging my Pixel 3, it no longer works. There's no sign of physical failure. it just refuses to charge my phone.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Wonderful!;Ok! Thanks!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not Mac compatible;Mac Air did not recognize cable and couldn’t connect any devices
5.0 out of 5 stars;Quality product;Looks great and works great
1.0 out of 5 stars;Stops working after 2 months;I ordered two cords. One stoppedcharging after a month of having and the 2nd cord stopped working after about 2 months. Do not recommend buying. I can't even get a refund cause it's after time to return 😒
2.0 out of 5 stars;Looks can be deceiving!;This cord looks sturdy on the outside, but I think the internals and connectors are cheap. It doesn't consistently charge my phone. I have to wiggle it around and leaving my phone in the perfect spot for it charge.
2.0 out of 5 stars;It'll work, but durability is an issue.;The charging speed is fine. The first cord split in the middle 30 days after I received it. Get Anker cables instead.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Ad touts durability but that was not the case for me;Poor quality. One of the two cords in the box came out of the box with a bad connection you have to fiddle with the wire to get it to charge.
2.0 out of 5 stars;wasn't thrilled;They didn't do what I expected them to do. Thought they could be used to charge phone from one of several portable batteries, but it didn't work that way.
1.0 out of 5 stars;7 days past return window first cord done.;Not a good quality. Title says it all.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great Cable;Works great!
5.0 out of 5 stars;"Nice USB ""C"" double ended cable... my";Looks great and is very professional quality...
5.0 out of 5 stars;Got on time;Love
2.0 out of 5 stars;Says two pack, but only got one....;The product itself worked great, but when you buy something that says it's a two pack and you only get one....?? I was not a happy camper with that.
2.0 out of 5 stars;No rapid charging.;Does not rapid charge. Misleading. Ordered to replace a slow charger.  Disappointed.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Missing a cord;Disappointed that there’s only one cord in a 2 pack. Would greatly appreciate if you could send me the other one.
1.0 out of 5 stars;50% Guarantee!;Glad that I had bought 2 of them and as one of the cables didn't work & wouldn't charge at all  I tried it with another one to find the fault in the cable instead of my charger/phone :)
5.0 out of 5 stars;High quality cables!;Great product
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great product at bargain price;Still works like new
2.0 out of 5 stars;What a let down;Loose fitting. Fall out of my pixel 4 xl and stop charging very easily. Super disappointed
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great;Solid cable
2.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't charge fast;It takes 2 hours to charge phone.
1.0 out of 5 stars;They start off great and then 💩💩;It works but I ordered two 2 packs (so 4 charging cords) 7/2/2020 and then I ordered another 2 pack on 9/4/2020 as of today, 12/4/2020, one cord is working...and I’m the mean mom that takes my kids iPads away for a week at a time so they are not being used every day.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good cord;Not a fan of the brand in general, but these cords serve their purpose.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Five Stars;Great cables, good length and durable!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Does not provide power/video for external USB-C monitor;This cable would not provide any power/video to an external, portable USB-C monitor I use as a secondary screen. Ended up returning them.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Case blocked plug.;Cord would not plug all the way in while phone was in protective otterbox case.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Only works in one orientation.;I don't know how, but for some reason, the wire only works in one orientation. One end specifically only works for my phone and one end specifically works for the plug. And you have to make sure it's facing the right way, even if there is no right direction. I would not recommend this. I've had it for months and it's been pretty consistent.
5.0 out of 5 stars;very good;very good
1.0 out of 5 stars;Less than a year and it no longer functions;The length of the cord and ruggedness of the cord covering was great. BUT it ceased working inside of a year. Bottom line: wish I'd never purchased it
1.0 out of 5 stars;Broken already;Had these for 6 weeks and they both no longer work. Buyer beware
1.0 out of 5 stars;Does not work!;I tried plugging it into multiple chargers. It will not charge my pixel 6 pro! either wire.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not up for the task.;Would not charge MacBook Air.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Didn't work.;Both of the adapters in this pack failed to work. I tried different headphones, different phones, and there was a continual cycle of connect-pop/crackle-disconnect-repeat. Guess what happened when I used one of my old adapters? The headphones worked fine. 🤦🏻‍♀️
1.0 out of 5 stars;Lasted less then a month;I used this every 2 days. One cord lasted 2 weeks then died. The second one lasted 3 weeks. Both are now dead with no signs of any issues.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't Last;Stopped working after 3 months , buy Anker
2.0 out of 5 stars;Make sure it fits;The cable looks well constructed.  Unfortunately,  the cable would not fit into my Pixel 2XL with its Seidio case on.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great  durability.;Works excellent.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Does not work;"I got the two pack. Neither cable would connect my external display to my PC laptop.  The external display came with shorter USB-C to USB-C cable but I wanted a longer one.  I know the display works because it is fine with the factory provided USB-C to USB-C cable, but this product does not work.  I get ""no signal"" error."

1.0 out of 5 stars;Quit working;Less than a year old and quit working. It sits by my bed and only plugged and unplugged,  so it's not wear and tear in my mind...
1.0 out of 5 stars;Both Failed and Nearly Destroyed My Phone.;Both of these charging cables had problems after a few months of use.  One failed quicker than the other.  Had I not been holding my phone both times or noticed the smoke starting to come out the bottom of the phone, it probably would have destroyed my phone leaving it plugged in.I would not recommend.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Won't stay plugged in;Such a disappointment! I bought a couple of these and have used them on 2 different phones, a Stylo4 , and a Galaxy S10e.They don't fit tight,  and fall out with almost any movement.  It's not the phone case either, I've removed them. still won't click in tight.

2.0 out of 5 stars;Quick charging but build quality is not up to the mark;At first usage it looked good, charges fast but after using for few days the covering of the USB adapter started coming out.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not a USB TO C CABLE;Beware.  This is a C to C cable & has few applications. I should have read the description more carefully.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not durable;Bought 2 cords when it wants to work it charges very fast and one of them gave out and doesn't work anymore.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Total Garbage;Compared to my other cables this one charges EXTREMELY slow.  I can plug in my iPad Pro Gen3 at 95% and 20 minutes later it's still 95%.  With any other cable it would have been at 99 or 100.  Something is very wrong with this cable.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Only lasted 6 months with light use;Since these were Amazon recommendations I thought they would be good quality and would last a long time. I liked them for the first 5 months but 2 cables both started working intermittently and finally I had to throw them out. Still looking for a good one.

1.0 out of 5 stars;Complete garbage from China;Bought a two pack of cables. One did not work out of the box, the other one failed after a couple of months. Save your money buy genuine Apple. Supposedly lifetime warranty, but good luck trying to figure out how to redeem that

1.0 out of 5 stars;Dont buy if you use phone while charging;Any small movement, the cable falls out the phone charging socket. This charger seems very durable but its just complete crap because it keeps falling out. While writing this review i had to put it back in 4 tiems already.

1.0 out of 5 stars;Slow to start charging;Does not transfer power quickly at first. It's strange, but I have to plug it in leave it alone for a couple of min. And then plug it in. Otherwise it won't charge
1.0 out of 5 stars;NOT a 'Sync' (or Data) cable.;"Despite the ad description saying ""High Speed Charging and Sync"", it is in fact not a sync (otherwise known as a data) cable. The cable feels and looks quality, but not useful for my needs."

1.0 out of 5 stars;This USB-C to USB-C Charging Cable Does Not Fit;I bought this cable only to have to return it. The cable did not fit the USB-C charging port of my Samsung Galaxy Note 9. I recommend not buying this cable if you have a phone like mine.,

1.0 out of 5 stars;Not worth it. My USB to C charges much better.;Doesn't even charge the phone in the car. Says charging, but my battery will actually die when it is attached. Was looking forward to the increased charging speeding heard you get from a C to C cord. Disappointing.

1.0 out of 5 stars;Worked for a month, then failed;"One of the two cables failed after about a month of use. It was ""plugged in by the side of the bed"" use, too, not even ""thrown in a bag, coiled and uncoiled"" use."

1.0 out of 5 stars;DIdnt work;Didn't work properly. Not good.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Slow transfer speed;I bought this cable as a second cable to be used with my Samsung SSD drive so I'd have one connected to my home computer and one to my laptop.  It seemingly worked just fine, but I've been noticing that my notebook computer (the one with the cable I'm reviewing) has been noticeably slower than my desktop computer (the one with the cable that came with my Samsung drive).  It finally occurred to me to try swapping cables to see if that's what was slowing down my workflow (I take and edit photos for a living), and BINGO!!!  I dragged and dropped a 1GB folder from my internal drive onto my SSD drive using the cable I'm reviewing then deleted the folder, switched cables and dragged the exact same folder from my internal drive to the SSD drive again.  It took literally no more than 20% the amount of time to transfer the folder with the old cable that came with my Samsung drive!!!  Yes, transferring data with the cable in this listing takes FIVE TIMES LONGER than with the factory cable.  I promptly tossed the new cable into the trash and am ordering one that's a fair amount more expensive but should transfer data as quickly as the factory Samsung cable.If all you need this cable for is to charge your device and transfer very small amounts of data, you're probably going to like this cable.  If you're using it to move large files or stream lots of data, STAY AWAY FROM THIS CABLE!!!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Broke in less than 6 months;Loved the product until it quit working less than 6 months after purchase.It began to wiggle in the charging port and would not charge at all :(Otherwise works fine
4.0 out of 5 stars;👍;Good
5.0 out of 5 stars;Durable;I got these after one cat chewed through another brand and a two year old disassembled a second popular white one..  Both were not in use at the time.  I was also tired of taping cords that couldn’t hold up to turning and twisting.These are excellent, inexpensive compared to repeated replacement of Apple charger cables.  I’ve been using them a couple of months and they hold up, give a quick charge, and hold up being repeatedly moved around.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Broke after 3 uses;I purchased these charging cords because it looked like a great deal and had good ratings, but I am very disappointed with the performance. I am meticulous about my cable use and after only 3 uses with my Macbook Air, the charger only works at a specific angle. I am not sure if this is just a faulty cable, but I will be sticking to the tried and true Anker for only a couple dollars more.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Price.;Love the item. Fast and long cord is great.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works and looks great;I have been using this for several weeks now and I have had no issues with charging my iPad.  I also am not seeing any signs of wear or tear yet.  connects to devices easily and stays connected with normal movement.  The color is fantastic as well.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Well spend;Best for the buck. Can't go wrong and end up purchasing couple more just incase they run out. Works just like the stock ones you receive with your phone/tablet/laptop quick charge enabled, files transfer in seconds (40gb). Good for the price and its durability no questions, and customer service is really hassle free. You all should try it, I own the type c to type c and also the usb to type c and couldn't be glad enough. Good for the kids as they're prone to damage the other kind charging cable that is not braided.
5.0 out of 5 stars;YES;no issues with fast charging my note 10 +
5.0 out of 5 stars;Durable cable;So far I'm loving this cable, it's very long which helps when I'm in a DR's office and my chair isn't close to a outlet.  The price was outstanding also.  It shipped out fast & arrived in secure pkg'ing.
5.0 out of 5 stars;A++++ Qualty;Very well made! Great quality!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Broke after a year;While it was nice while it worked, both cords stopped working after a year. And I don't mean they each lasted a year. I mean they lasted a total of 1 year
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not as robust and it looks;I bought a 2 pack of the 3.3 ft cords. The build quality feels nice but use them gingerly. It does feel heavy duty out of the package and the cord has a satisfying snap into my phone, until the cord breaks. I leave my phone on my night stand and, as they tend to do, my phone has fallen off a few times with each of the cords plugged in and the male ends of both have bent and become practically useless. The problem is that if the phone lands on the plastic sleeve that protects the cord adaptor, it torques the male adaptor. The cheap rubber OEM cord that came with my Pixel 2 fell dozens of times without issue over three years before finally wearing. The first of these cords I used broke literally the first night. My bad, disappointed, shouldn't have done that, that's why I have two. I've been more careful with the second but it just broke too in the same way a few months later. Now I'm shopping again so I thought I'd pass it on. Nice cord if you set your phone on the floor.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Good at first, not durable at all;This product was horrible, stopped charging properly after just a week and after a month stopped working completely, for both of them, please don't buy this it's horrible
1.0 out of 5 stars;Garbage product that breaks in 8-10 months;I bought this product because of the high reviews. Do not be fooled, many of these reviews are likely fake.In my experience, both of the cables broke within 10 months.  I emailed the vendor and asked for a replacement in warranty, and they were nice enough to provide me a replacement.Long story short, both replacement cables broke within 8 months, by which point the product warranty was over.In conclusion, only a good deal if you like the idea of replacing the cable every 8-10 months. Otherwise, spend a bit more and get something that will last.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Bad wire;Bad wire.  stops working after 2 months.
2.0 out of 5 stars;USB snaps easily;Charging is great, but after a month of use the USB part broke and almost got stuck in my phone. Not good for taking with you places. If you want to leave it at home where you'll be extra careful pluging and unplugging it then it might be okay.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Disconnects too easily.;Very loose connection to phone. Disconnects too easily.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Don't  waste your money!!;The cable works really well for the first couple of months, then it just stopped working.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Looks can be deceiving;This appears to be a great product. Sturdy, thick wire but after two weeks one of the two cables failed. The USB side didn't hold up to being plugged in and out repeatedly
1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't last;My cord didn't even make it 45 days.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Cable failed;One cable lasted maybe a week or two. The other cable in the 2 pack never worked so I bought a new car charger thinking my charger was broken.Product feels and looks high quality but the ends aren't very durable or at least the ones I received were not made well.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works as expected - not much else to say;"They work exactly as described. The material is fairly sturdy and hasn't worn down significantly in the few months since I bought the first set of these. The cloth does begin to ""loosen"" a bit where the cord gets a lot of flex (for me, towards the end the device plugs in to) but so far it seems to be purely visual - there is no fraying or flexibility issues. They also carry as much current as I expected them to.Overall, a great cable."
5.0 out of 5 stars;Bought for iPad;I bought this for my iPad because I like watching TV in bed and needed a longer cord to charge while watching. Anyway, it is long and it works fine with my iPad. It’s also way sturdier than the Apple chargers, I wish Apple would make their chargers more sturdy!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Does not last long;I had 2 pack from January 5th til now and both have broke.... not very durable... I now have to find more charging USB cord... it was good with charging and length was awesome to plug in and use phone on bed but now I can not use them... so sad...
5.0 out of 5 stars;Better than expected!;Great for the price they look and feel study but that is for the test of time to say. 5 stars hopefully I won't be back to downgrade.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Overall, pretty good, but...;The only thing I didn't like about it has been that it doesn't stick out long enough to charge most devices.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Charger is excellent on my Mac book pro;Nice and long and comes with a strap to hold to extra wire.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works great;It does the job 🙂
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good cord, one problem;"Only problem was a ""lip"" of plastic blocking the insertion of plug into my headphones. Solved with a mail clipper."
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect!;Perfect for my new phone!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Fits great;Nice looking cord for use in car
1.0 out of 5 stars;This cable didn't last 30 days!;I've only had this cord for about 20 days and it is already not working. I need a new cord from you guys!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Trash;This  cord doesn't charge at all ...It just beeps the whole time so disappointing..
2.0 out of 5 stars;One worked fine;One of the cables worked fine, the other I would either get a very slow charge, or it would not connect properly
1.0 out of 5 stars;Worked great for 2 months!;Very fast charging cable BUT 2 months later it just stopped charging! Very disappointing
5.0 out of 5 stars;Excellent;Excellent USB cable super convenient!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great product!;The cord is very good. It looks like very high-end product. It is charging fast. The delivery is on time. I just bought it so I do not know the durability yet.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good choice for iPhone 12 mini;Perfect fit and it charges my phone well.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Top Top;Top quality cable
5.0 out of 5 stars;Only USBC charging cord I would buy!;This is a great charging cord for a USBC unit. I have the Galaxy Note20 and this cord fast charges perfectly. I bought it for the length, and was extremely happy with the quality of the cord. The small velcro strip is underrated and is very helpful when you want to prop the cord up for easier access. Highly recommend!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Loose connector;I bought this to use with my iPad Pro but it won’t stay connected to enable the charge.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Buen producto;Excelente producto, largo y carga rápido
3.0 out of 5 stars;So far 1 out of 2 work wonderful.;One works wonderful, still does.  The other didn't work coming out of box.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Braided Cables for the win!;I've become a huge fan of braided cables.  They seem to resist bending and fraying much better than my plastic-coated cables.  They seem to be cooler, as I have a few plastic-coated cables that seem to always be hot.  I like the extra length of these cables, which makes it easy to place the connectors where I need them most!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Worth it;Good quality! Worth the buy
2.0 out of 5 stars;Stop working in a relatively short period of time.;Both of these wires stopped charging my phone in a relatively short period of time.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Excellent cable;Beautiful in design, easy to wrap up and bend. I've had no issue with stiffness or decay (in the short duration of my ownership). I definitely recommend it.[note] for some reason Amazon has my name wrong, weird, bugs happen no biggie
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good value;Good value works good
3.0 out of 5 stars;Meh;This charger falls out of the Galaxy Note 10. However, it charges super fast.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Better quality then I expected;feels more durable then I though. Came with 2 cords. Looked amazing and charges my note 10 plus on the same speed that my factory chord did, even though its not rated with all the tech it still will fast charge. Haven't tried with the new 45 watt charger though but mine is 25 watt so its definitely faster the the old 15watt charger cables
5.0 out of 5 stars;Very very well made, and the color is great!!;Very well made and far exceeds my expectations charges superfast without any trouble!!
5.0 out of 5 stars;they work;They function and they charge my phone

5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect charging cable;Awesome lengthy Charging Cord
3.0 out of 5 stars;Work great , until they don't;These seem to hold up ,until you get any type of kink in them by the port  part.  Bought my  second pair.  But they seem to have a bad time with being pinched even a little .
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good value;They don't last forever, but they are a good value.  Sturdy and if you don't twist and bend them around they will last longer. this is true with all charger cables.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good quality and value.;I like the woven type. They seem more durable. The 6 ft is nice. Would buy again.
4.0 out of 5 stars;es buen cable;Fijarse que la configuracion si sea... yo quería USB A a USB - C y estos son únicamente USB -C a USB-C
1.0 out of 5 stars;False description not a 60w fast charger;This cable is suppose to be charging up to 60w and it is charging the same as a standard cable..... not charging devices at anymore then 25w
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works great;So good I got two
2.0 out of 5 stars;Ordered on March 19, 2021 (1 item);1st cord no longer works.  About typical for any replacement cord.  I buy so many of these its insane.  But I guess if they were made to last manufacturers would not make any money.
2.0 out of 5 stars;looks like good product but...;the box was damaged, without security seals and the product looked as if it had already been used.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Durable and very good price;I bought these because my Oculus Quest charging cable broke after I tripped on it. An official replacement cable from Oculus would have cost 3 times more the price. These cables are nice because the lining is not the usual cheap plastic, and it feels durable. Good product for the price.
5.0 out of 5 stars;5 Star  product;Best quality.  The only cable to have.
5.0 out of 5 stars;just what I ordered;They work great for me. I ordered them and received them quickly. I started using them as soon as they arrived.
5.0 out of 5 stars;works;great price, item looks just like image. works!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great option;Able to power iPads to Tesla vehicles.
5.0 out of 5 stars;These cables scream!!;.. Fast as h***--heck!I don't know if it's a USB C to C, or my brick,, but all I know is that these are my Fastest charging cables and I've got some 3 ft by same company, and they seem to perform well too,, but I haven't tested them right next to me with my phone like these 6ft (they're always in my car.)Anyhow, I'm going to look for these cables all the time they look great to me so far..
5.0 out of 5 stars;Remember what size you order;I say remember the size you order because I normally have the 10 foot cord and this time I got the shorter cord. The cord works great!
5.0 out of 5 stars;My cord lasted for YEARS;My first cord lasted so long, that I haven't the slightest recollection where I even put the second cord, as I haven't ever had an issue with the first one. Eventually it was stepped on pretty hard and that did it in, but before that, this cord has never failed me. JSAUX has a lot of high quality products, and this certainly is no exception.
4.0 out of 5 stars;One cable didn’t work out of the box - mfg fixed it;One doesn’t work out of the box, second one does and the  manufacturer made it right.
5.0 out of 5 stars;great quality;second  time buying this chargers to replace my old broken original celular brand cables
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great Item;Works Perfectly
3.0 out of 5 stars;Failed after two years of limited use.;I purchased these cables around two years ago as well as 8 cables from INIU and 5 from NIMASO once most of my devices required USB C. The other cables were a lower cost per cable (and still are), but at the time the JSAUX had the fastest shipping and that was the deciding factor in ordering them first. Despite only being used intermittently (my wife used these and the NIMASO cables, I have used the INIU cables exclusively), both of the JSAUX cables have failed while all of the other cables are still fully functional. There is no significant damage or wear, they simply won't register any connection or charge any devices. meanwhile the INIU cables that I have used/abused are more kinked and scraped without any sign of failure (and if there were, the INIU cables come with a 3 year warranty vs 18 months with JSAUX). I attribute the longer life of the other cables to the improved strain relief (pictured). JSAUX now makes an improved cable, but at an even higher price point.
5.0 out of 5 stars;reliable;Great usb c cable
4.0 out of 5 stars;Buy these.;I purchased 3 different USB cable sets in different configurations from different Amazon vendors and they all rocked and share this review copy. The best way to be sure to have plenty, and not get taken for a ride at the phone store or convenience store or wherever.I don't expect military grade durability and longevity. But reasonable.  4, not 5, stars.Good quality cables and a solid value. I recommend them!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works As Advertised;So far these cables have worked well and continue to hold up.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good for charging, not for gaming.;These cables are good for cherging stuff, but if you were hoping to use it with one of your controllers on your console or PC you're out of luck. Plugged my 8BitDo controller into my PC with one of these cables and it came up with an error on my pc that said the device malfunctioned. Tested again with both the 8BitDo cable the controller came with and a PowerA cable from another controller and both of those cables worked just fine. If you want a USB-C cable to use for gaming I would recommend buying one of the PowerA 10ft cables instead.
3.0 out of 5 stars;one cord stopped working after 10 days ... the other is OK;2 cords in package.  Nice packaging.  The cords look well built and durable.  But after 2 weeks, one cord does not work at all - is now useless trash.  The other cord works for charging my MacBook and iPad.  But the charging is very slow, much slower than with a thunderbolt cable.  2-3 hours to charge my MacBook form 25% to 100%.  These cords are cheap, but I got what I paid for ... not much
5.0 out of 5 stars;Durable and exactly what I was looking for;Your standard charging cable, works great and fast.
4.0 out of 5 stars;VERY DURABLE;Great product. I am impressed with the charging capability.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Does not do Fast Charging;I ordered a total of 4 10ft cables. Not 1 of them does fast charging. Tried with different bricks. All my 6ft cords do super fast charging with the same bricks. Using Samsung usbc bricks. I'm using a Galaxy S21 Plus.They seem to connect well and I have not had not work. But if you are looking for super fast charging these cables will not do it
3.0 out of 5 stars;usb c but its usb 2.0;USB C and USB 2.0 dont go together. Why didnt you just remove the data cables and save the few cents you could have spent and at least made it USB 3.0
5.0 out of 5 stars;They works as stated.;Very Impressed! No overheating.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great build quality;Package delivered on time..good build quailty so far works great!!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Would be 5 stars if it came with 3;Good but maybe an extra one for value
3.0 out of 5 stars;Adequate;The cords are of a lesser quality than I had hoped. My fast charger seems to burn them out. The problem might be with my charging cube, but this was my experience with these cords.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Only one works properly.;I've been cursed with the have to flip it due to a bad connection in one of the cables. It only charges in one orientation. Nice cable aside from the caveat.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't stay connected;Often it losses its connection.  They are cheap.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn’t last long;I’ve gone through so many usb c cords, it’s ridiculous.  This one will only charge my Mac laptop if it’s closed.  Charges my iPad ok but takes a while.  I’ve found using a Mac block and plugging it directly into the wall speeds this up.  However, the durability is awful.  They only last about a month before they either snap off or stop charging.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great cable;Best phone cable ever had... tough and great connections
3.0 out of 5 stars;Unidirectional?!;The user guide says unidirectional?  Wtf who sells a unidirectional cable without saying that is what it is? The box says nothing in English about that
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good cables;Both cables work well and seem very durable.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Charging speed;I have a s22 plus and when I first plus it in its say super fast charging then after like 30 seconds it goes to just fast charge. Idky it does this or what is wrong but just disappointed
5.0 out of 5 stars;The BEST!;Who would have thought that this would be a thrill for me?!  I have tried other charger cords and have had to return them because they did not have a tight fit. Some actually slipped out when moved and they were supposed to be compatible with the model  1932 (late 2018) Mac Air.  This one snaps in and stays in and charges perfectly.  As for the durability, I have had these types of cords before for other units and they are durable. I expect this to be the same.  Actually, probably more so because I was surprised at how thick it was when I took it out of the box.  The price is great.  I thought I was paying for one (not all pics are believable) but it was for two.  Nice surprise!
3.0 out of 5 stars;stopped working;Worked well for a while, but eventually stopped charging my laptop. Feels loose in the socket when plugged in
4.0 out of 5 stars;Not Super fast charging capable but works well;It's more of a fast charging cable than a super fast charging capable. the length is good, seems durable. Would recommend for samsung s10 and under.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Really good quality;I really likt this item. The quality and length is good for what I need
3.0 out of 5 stars;Would give more stars but one doesn't charge;Bought the 2 pack one works great the other just keeps connecting and unconnected. Wanted 2 for me and the husband.
3.0 out of 5 stars;When I first received them, my MacBook told me it’s not a real product;When I first received them, my MacBook told me that my battery was damaged, and it is not a real product. I used the other cord and it works fine, but I hope it doesn’t do anything crazy to my battery considering that.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great, but;The cable comes out of the phone port easily. Just keep an eye on it if you’re using it at the same time as it’s charging.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works OK.;Good value. Questionable durability.
3.0 out of 5 stars;One of the two lasted longer than two months;I've learned that buying products in this general category type (cables, chargers, or electronics accessories more broadly) is hit or miss and more often than not a miss.  This came as a pack of two and one has worked fine for two years while the other failed within a few months.  At this product's  price point I would consider that a neutral outcome.  However, a 50% success rate for any product is horrible and suggests poor quality control at the least and my guess is a prospective buyer has an equal chance of getting either zero, one, or two cables that function for a couple of years.  Still since the one working cable has lasted at least two years and the cost was low I feel three stars is a fair rating.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works as they should;Good cables, does not provide super charge with Xiomi 62W charger but works great with Samsung fast chargers
5.0 out of 5 stars;Go For It!;I purchased the 2 pack charging cords after reading a lot of reviews.I'm so glad I did!I have a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, and a Samsung Tablet.These cords charge both devices.When I charge my phone, the screen display reads 'SUPER fast charging'..The Samsung wireless charger I purchased at the Verizon Store only charges on 'fast wireless charging'.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Sturdy, good snug click-in connections, but maybe not as flexible as you might like;Seems like good connectors, working great so far. Fine power transmission, no apparent issues. Sturdy but this means also not too flexible: If you're looking for a supple cord that bends easily to put less stress on the jacks it plugs into, then this isn't for you. But if you want a sturdy (almost stiff, even) cord that should last, and you can use it in a careful way that won't overstress the jacks, then this is 5-star so far (~1 month use to date.)
5.0 out of 5 stars;I bought the improper thing but...;I thought these came with the blocks. They didnt. Still worked in my old one. Even gave a cord to my gma! Long enough for her and its silver not black! Perfect for her eyes!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Don’t charge between devices;These cables only change devices from wall/main outlets. Beyond data transfer they cannot charge between devices. Plugged my iPad into my MacBook and charging was not supported only data transfer. Just a heads up if you intend to use these cables for multipurpose charging use.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Excellente product;Well made
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great length and sturdy feel.;Cable is reasonably flexible and feels high quality with decent strain relief.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Works beautifully at first;Love the extra length and how well they work at first. After about a month the cables charge less and less. What previously took a couple of hours to recharge takes several hours, sometimes all night.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Issues charging with lower battery;Cables work fine when phone battery is 75% or above. When battery falls below that, a rapid charging notice continually cycles across the screen not allowing the phone to sleep. Using a 20W charger with USB-C connection to a Pixel 7 phone. Short cable that came with the phone and one I just purchased from another  manufacturer as a replacement do not exhibit this behavior. Cables seem durable but this behavior is unacceptable fearing damage to the phone. Past the return window by a few days.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Meets my requirements;The cables appears durable and meets my expectations.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not the best!;It looks Sturdy and they have a very nice design so cute. yet they break so very easily.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great for charging Pixel 6 and iPad pro;Great cables. Using to charge my Pixel 6 and iPad pro. Rapid charges pixel with no issues.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Nice length but fail after about 6 months of regular use;This is still not a bad product but you have to be careful and not twist the ends at all if you do the cable will faili bought the two pack and the first one lasted about 6 months.. the second one seems to be ok
4.0 out of 5 stars;average durability;thought would be more durable, but the end C portion did not like repeated connect/disconnect,
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great power cord;Works liked my original power cord!
4.0 out of 5 stars;I use this to charge my Android OnePlus 8;Pretty decent quality I don't know or can verify if it actually supports a full 60 watts like it claims however it does charge pretty fast and does its job it's a little bit longer than the cable the phone came with which is what I was looking for.
3.0 out of 5 stars;One of the cords stopped working today.;Had these almost a year. They worked well. Then all of a sudden one just died. Other cord is still going strong. Kind of disappointed that one stopped charging.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Durable;Great charger. Very durable. It's been lasting for over a month now and charges just fine for both of my phones
4.0 out of 5 stars;It charges CP fast.;A little bit stiff and hard to manage but that should help the longevity.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good cables;Very reliable
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great quality;Good length, and durability
3.0 out of 5 stars;One worked, one didn't.;Bought the 10ft 2 pack less than 2 weeks ago. Cord #1 was working great until our new puppy chewed through it this morning. No big deal, that's why I bought a 2 pack. Unfortunately cord #2 just straight up doesn't work. Tried plugging into different blocks, switching the ends around, nothing. I'll give 3 stars for the cord that did work, but be warned you might be sent a product that doesn't work.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not good;I didn't realize that I actually bought this brand before for a previous phone, if I had I never would have purchased this again. Original variety bundle pack with I purchased all stopped working within a few months. The new ones that I ordered for extra length came with a short in them with both cords. They can not support ultra fast charging (45 watt) or higher. My shorter 4 ft cord that came with the 45w brick charges my phone just fine but not these longer cords. They get a 2 because they are indeed longer and feel premium although they are definitely not and I'm sure they'll both be dead by the spring time. Not worth your money! Believe me!
4.0 out of 5 stars;En pruebas de calidad;Espero que sean de buena calidad
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great fast-charging cord;Sturdy, fast-charging cord. I wish it was a couple inches longer, but other great!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great product but not very durable;This is a great charging cable, very fast, and long enough for me to use it in bed after turning the other way. My only issue is that the connector becomes loose after a bit and you have to make sure to bend it a certain way for your phone to charge. Annoying!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Favorite cords!;I upgraded from the Samsung Note9 to the Note20 Ultra a couple months ago. The cord that comes with the phone is too short for my liking. We have our bed raised pretty high and if I want to scroll on my phone before I crash, the original cord made my life miserable. With this cord, I can turn the completely opposite direction and have plenty slack. They are very sturdy and won't be breaking any time soon. I had been using this same brand for my Note9 but switched to this cord because the new brick for the Note20 is USB-C to USB-C. (Note9 was a USB to USB-C)
5.0 out of 5 stars;great cord;amazing charges FAST
3.0 out of 5 stars;Lightning-Fast Cord but doesn't last;These cords have blazing fast speeds, if your phone and outlet charger supports it, but in about five months they begin to not connect properly.  I suspect there is a lack of durability in the wire to end connection that wears out much faster than it should.  Works great when new though, but pricey for something that doesn't last.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good quality;Nice cable but way to stiff.
4.0 out of 5 stars;A quality Charging Cable...;This cable will not fail from the Norman bending and flexing from everyday use when charging your devices.  It is very well built and rugged.
4.0 out of 5 stars;As described.;Cord works well with my s22 phone.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Falls out of Samsung Note 10 +;Do not get this if you have a Note 10 +. It will NOT stay plugged in while you use your device (falls out and comes loose so easily). Hopefully it works on other devices but I wouldn't know.Edit: Great customer service, issued a full refund a few days later. Hopefully this works for your device because everything else about it is good (durability, length, etc)
3.0 out of 5 stars;Will not do Samsung DEX.;Nice cable, very well made and works great for charging at a high rate.  Bit, it will not do Samsung DEX.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Does not transmit video;Quality seems good. Length as advertised. Provided power to my laptop. Did not send video from laptop to large monitor, which is what I needed it for.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Yes Go ahead and purchase these cables.;Good price for a two pack. As advertised. C to C cable. Length is okay, for price. Durable and fast charging capable.
2.0 out of 5 stars;One of the cords stop working after using it for a couple days;One of the cords stopped working after using it a few times I actually ordered a few more cords from someone else just in case the other one stops working
3.0 out of 5 stars;Compatibility;Can't evaluate durability since just acquired product.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works exactly as I expected it to.;It fast charges even at this length and hasnt worn out quickly works slowly on data transfers but its the worst. Seems durable but not over exaggerated bends repeatedly so beware of that. But very much not low quality.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Fast Charge If It Works;As soon as I plugged this in, it would go out every few seconds. Its first 10 minutes charging it lost power...while plugged in...I tried other items in this outlet, and this cord in somewhere else and the cord is the problem.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Haven't used frequently yet .....;Haven't used frequently yet.Appears to be a good cord, no problem using it to power my external monitor I bought here on Amazon.I'll do a follow up post once i get more use out of it.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Want to give it more, but did not work for my application so at the same time wanted to give it less;I have a laptop dock that uses a USB-C to USB-C cord to connect the dock to the laptop. The dock manual says the cord that came with the dock can handle up to 20V @ 3A i.e. this is the max. This cable says it can handle 20V @ 3A, but when I plug my laptop into my dock using this cord it does not work. It will connect and will work some what, but there is constant cutouts, which then when it reconnects my computer has to reconnect to my internet, my VPN network, all my accessories like my keyboard, mouse, speakers etc. that are also connect to the dock, and for some reason cut out at the same time, and then their software also needs to be cycled in order for them to work properly again.I originally purchased this for a bit extra length because the cord that came with the dock is only one meter, but sure enough, once I reconnected the stock cable that came with the dock no more cut outs.. So I'm not sure exactly the issue, it could be a slurry of different things, but it is in fact the cable that was the issue.I'm sure it will work great for charging phones and this cable hasn't moved anywhere other than my home office desk, so the durability wasn't necessarily tested, but out of the box the durability and built quality seem to be above average. Also I just tried to plug it into my phone (Galaxy S10+) to see/feel the connection, and it fits in really well and you can feel that click into place. I have purchased other cables here on Amazon and they don't have that click that holds the cable into the phone so if you slightly bump, move, or the cable stiffness is forcing the cable into the phone at an angle, you will lose connection to the power source and it will either stop charging, or will say like 7.5 hours until fully charged, which it should take like an hour, maybe two with a slow charger. Either way, this is why I gave it two stars instead of just one.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Too thick!;It has great charging  power. I gave it a 4 star  coz the code is way to thick and bulky to carry around!
5.0 out of 5 stars;C-USB long cable;These cables are long and durable they come with a cable tie and work perfect. Wound definitely buy again.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Well built and good warranty;"I got these because soo many usbc cords have failed me.  The JSAUX had some of the best reviews when they came out and have a good warranty.  If had seen Anker Powerline II (lifetime) had came out I likely would have gone with them... my go-to for cables due to easy return policy, but I expect these to last a fair bit.  Not as plyable as I would like but Im OK with that. One in each car and one for lugging around. Also only 60W (I have a MBP 15"" so it can use 100W) and usb2 speeds (480mb) vs 10gb for the Anker.  So yeah... go with the Anker for a few bucks more unless you just want some simple charging cords for the car - as I do.  Some reviews suggest lifetime warranty on these but it is not advertised anywhere - nor do I recall seeing a warranty card when I got it."
5.0 out of 5 stars;It's a long cord, how hard could that be?;I have bought other cords in the past but these seems studier and are more than long enough.  Took to my phone and other USB C devices with no issue.  I'll update this if anything changes.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works great!!;I no longer have to worry about the cable pulling out from moving around with these cables. This being a two pack makes it even better!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not 45W compatible;"Did not perform like original charging cable with my 45W charger. See attached photos. The original charger cable provides true ""Super Fast 2.0"" at a faster 45W charge on my Samsung S22+.  This cable only supplies ""Super Fast"" charge rate of 25W with a slower charge rate. It works, but not at the performance advertised."
3.0 out of 5 stars;It’s what it is supposed to be;It’s just what I ordered and it works like it is supposed to do
5.0 out of 5 stars;Excellent Data/Charing Cables;Well made and durable. Works for charging and data transfer.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good and dependable!!;Always works quickly!!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great length.;Quality seems good.  Length is good.  Still be careful on bending and placing heavy objects on cord.  I bought 2 in a value pack and 1 didnt last a month the other is doing great.
4.0 out of 5 stars;This will not run video. It’s just a charging cable;Does not do video. Only for charging
4.0 out of 5 stars;Cable;Very nice with the cord strap
4.0 out of 5 stars;good cord;Good cord
5.0 out of 5 stars;USB 2.0 data, USB PD power, five wire (GND, VBUS, CC, D+, D-) cable.;This is a 5 wire cable:  GND, VBUS, CC, D+ and D- (confirmed by ohm meter).  Cable only support USB 2.0 480 Mbps speeds over D+ and D- because it has no USB 3.0 or USB 3.1 Rx or Tx data wires.A1, A12, B1, B12 -----GND----- A1, A12, B1, B12A4, A9, B4, B9 -----VBUS----- A4, A9, B4, B9X5 ---- CC ---- X5X6 ----D+ ---- X6X7 ---- D- ---- X7Note X5, X6, X7 means CC, D+ and D- each have one wire that is connected to either A or B on each end.PRO - Works with the PD chargers to fast charge the Pixel 3a phone at 9V 2A (18W).CON - It is a stiff cable, probably because the wires are large and maybe because it has a fabric covering.
3.0 out of 5 stars;One of the two just stopped working;I got a two pack that I started using in mid-January. Now a little over two months later, one of them no longer works. I tested the ports, the adatper, and outlet and it is the cord. It's in a low traffic area and has been very gently used and handled. The other one is in my travel bag so getting little use but still works.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Superb!!!;This is a SUPER DOPE CABLE...
5.0 out of 5 stars;Work great;These cables work great. They have super fast charging, just use the original block.Cord has a lot of resistance and sturdy material
2.0 out of 5 stars;Charging wire;Very disappointed in charging time. Takes much longer than expected.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great cables. Ordered a second set!;Cables are cables, right?Not at all. I got a set of these way back, so I could charge a phone at home and keep a cable in my car. Awesome. Works great/functions well. The braided nylon material seems to hold up better than plain rubber cable. The ends have not broken/chiped/torn etc. The little velcro cable-keeper is a nice touch.Sadly, I misplaced one of my beloved cords, so I've ordered another set!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Cable feels cheap;The cable feels cheap and the connectors do not feel sturdy. Definitely not a premium cable
3.0 out of 5 stars;Wrong cord for my phone.;I tried to get new charging cord gor my S-20 cell phone. This one did not fit. I returned it.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Was very happy with it until my wife's Nexus 5x got damaged. But the customer support was great.;Updated Review:The cable has nice and strong build quality and it worked well for a month charging my Moto X4 and wife's Nexus 5x. Then one day the charging port on my wife's Nexus 5x got damaged when charging with this cable. The metal, which does give the cable a premium feel, on the ends of the cable got very hot. Had to get her a new phone. Not sure if it was the phone or the cable to fault.I was contacted by the customer service and requested to having the damaged cable for their engineers to figure out what may have gone wrong. They also reimbursed me for the new phone I had to get. The customer service was great, and I added a star back for them trying to figure out what may have gone wrong and also compensating for my loss.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Usb-c cable;Works fine no problem so far
3.0 out of 5 stars;Decent cables;The cables are good i bought 2 sets but within a week 1 cable is having problems disconnecting randomly already
3.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't fit inside case;Seems like a sturdy charger but the plastic is so bulky that it won't fit inside a standard waterproof case for s21 ultra. I would have to remove the case every time I want to charge it. Returning for a slimmer charge cord.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Did not intend to purchase this item.;The item was not what I needed.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Does NOT support Samsung 45w charging.;This cable does NOT support 45w fast charging 2.0 for the S22 Ultra or the S22 plus. It will only support 25w super fast charging 1.0.Another downside is that although we'll built, the cable is very stiff.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Long and durable;Nice and long so I can use my phone while it's charging. A 5-6 foot cable sounds long until your wall socket is at the baseboard and behind the bed and won't reach to your nightstand when your phone rings at night, so the extra length is great. Tough enough that my cats can't chew through it too!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Connectivity Problems 5 Months Later;UPDATED 09 08 20 The cable still works. Though I noticed that there is no way to clip the wire into the port like the genuine cables do. In bed plugged in wire on my chest and the cable just pops out. When I charge it I have to make sure that it's charging since the cable randomly pops out of the charging port.It does what it's supposed to. But if you move your phone around a lot while charging. This isn't the cable for you.UPDATED 05 21 19 These work well.  They charge the phone fast.  Though the one USB C that goes into the phone on one of the cables doesn't work properly all of the time.  The cable i rarely use has issues charging the phone.  When the phone is touched the phone no longer charges without notice.  The other cable that i use all of the time does not have this issue.  not sure what is happening though i have no issues with the other one.Original ReviewFast Charge Works but You Need A Proper Power SourceTo use fast or quick charge you have to use a power brick that supports it.  A USBc cable and a USBc charger doesn't work for quick or fast charge. The cables are compatible if you have the proper charger to do so, such as the charger that came with the Google Pixel 2.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Mediocre charge rate on Oneplus 7T;Charge rate is limited to 2000mA (10W). must be related to it being only USB 2.0 (I'm guessing the phone and the charger can't negotiate).  It's OK, but not any better than the old USB A to USB-C cords I've been using.  By contrast, a full USB-C 3.0 data cable can charge at the expected 3000mA.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Convenient length;Ease of use.  The length is great.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good Performance Experience;I have purchased these cords before and have been very satisfied with how they work. They are as fast as you allow them to be. If you have a box that supports the various forms of fast charging, then they deliver accordingly. They are durable and there is no performance bleed over time. Recommend!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Plug up with these!;I use these cables with my Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ and I have to say it's the best cable I've ever used. A friend got me my first one and now when my friends get USB-C charging phones they get a set.I couldn't pass up having another set. They let my phone get the 45watts to super fast charge which is rare on a non OEM phone cable.Don't miss out on these great cables. Excellent price, awesome quality, 6ft+ length, cool colors.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Seemed nice, but didn't transfer data as stated;They look quality and came quickly/well packaged. F you're just looking for something to charge your devices, these may work and could be a good purchase.However, testing multiple devices they would not transfer data. Phone to computer, laptop to external storage, laptop to dock/external monitor, nothing!2 stars - if you're only looking for a few more charging cables they seem relatively nice. I cannot speak to longevity as they did not meet my need.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Not for everything usb-c, but good at what it is made for;First off, the seller states what it can do. USB protocol 2.0, and fast charge. This cable is perfect for powering devices and charging phones and tablets. Not so hot for data transfers, but as the seller has stated several of times it’s mostly for fast charging. I use this to power a secondary switch dock set up. Granted any type c to type c cable can do that but this is the cheapest I found and since I’m not pushing displays through this I don’t need top of the line cables. Like I said it’s good at what it is designed for and with best bang for buck.
5.0 out of 5 stars;They've been working great;I really like these they seem to work well they seem reasonably heavy duty and the woven fabric covering on the cords makes them seem nice and also allows you to color code with the newer USB-C micro on both ends
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great Cable. But...;WARNING: If you have a UAG FOLIO CASE for the iPad Pro 12.9” 2018 like me, there is a slight problem while plugging the cord in. You have to pull back on the case and then plug the cable in because the cable is too thick at the connector, which is slightly blocked by the edge of the case. Other than that it works great and charges quickly and I have no other problems with the cable. Length is perfect for daily needs and this cable is very durable and should last you a long time.If you found this review helpful make sure to let amazon know by hitting the helpful button.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Did not work for 60W charger;Brought this to be attached to a Blitzforce GaAN (BFG) compact laptop USB-c/USB-a charger as a spare one to the barrel port charger for my DELL latitude laptop.Looks like this cable is unable to provide 20V @3A to the laptop BFG to Laptop when only USB-C is in operation. So is it a problem with the new BFG or with the cable.I have a better USB-C->USB->C cable from a different traditional 85W charger  that is able to pull 60W + sans problems..I had a really old Transmart USB-C->USB-C, I got for my phone about 3 years back at 1/2 the price of this. When I use that, I am getting the same performance. The same yellow warning and time to charge on my laptop. So returned this and got a 100W Twin pack for just 2$ more.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Nice quality but disappointed;I was tired of the short length cable that came with my phone so i purchased this and it charges slower than my old one... pretty disappointing honestly
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not for long term use;Chargers didn't even last a year.  One was used in my bedroom for a night charger and went out after about 6 months.  The other wasn't used very often and also stopped charging as well.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Nice set of long type c double end cables;These are nice sturdy cables for charging from a type c to type c connector.  Length is great.  Being 2 meters in length makes them functional in most all applications.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great solid cable;Great solid cable. Fits perfectly on both my iPad Pro, the 6ft cable Is just the right length. I can have it plugged in Nextel my bed or on the couch. The ends seem very well made and the braided cable is nice. Came in nicely packed and on time, I did not get any weird accessory message when I plugged my iPad in. Definitely happy with my purchase. Highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good cable.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great Customer Service;Order this cable because I've used cable by this company before and was very happy with the quality.  I ordered the 2-Pack, but only 1 cable was ship. Sure, errors do happen and when I notified the company, they said they stood behind their product, shipped out a new order.  Good product, Excellent customer service.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Be Careful;They work great, but I will say this: because of the way the plug is designed, it sticks out quite a bit further from your phone than my OEM cable. I have no doubts on the cables durability, but I suspect that this will eventually impact the port on your phone if you use it while charging it. Take care not to hit it around too much.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Replaced my cables that weren't always connecting properly;Tough cable extra long but comes with Velcro to keep it neat.  Been using twice a day for a couple months... Works perfectly
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great cables;They work great
3.0 out of 5 stars;I have a finicky phone, wouldn't make contact with the wire. Not the wires fault ..;Nice product, just didn't work on my finicky phone.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Ridiculolusly Long -Which I love;Cord came quickly and is super LOONNGG! Exactly what I wanted :) Coupled with the 25w Super Fast USB Wall Charger it charges my Samsung S21 Ultra in a really short time!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Does the job until it doesn't;The cable length is great. The braided cable is great. For the price, this is a good buy if you expect to replace them every few months. Everything was well-built EXCEPT the most vital part, the housing for the wires at the jack. So unsurprisingly, it stopped working overnight unless I kept it still at the perfect angle. I just re-ordered. I highly recommend electrical tape immediately applied to both ends. I have been using this with a Samsung Chromebook Plus (first gen) and another company's wall adapter. The wall adapter end is fine. My charging port is fine. Have had to make do with a backup solution that will only charge if it's off until I get this replacement that I am going to wrap up like a mummy.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works but doesn't stay in properly;"Have only a week experience with both the cables.With an 18w charger, both rapid charges my brother's Pixel 2 XL but doesn't stay. No ""click"" feel when plugging the cord in. Tried a amazon basics one and that works fine. This would be a great deal but keeps coming out when he charges his phone overnight which he uses as his work alarm.Length is nice. Feels sturdy, but bending will cause some kinks later."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Not working when controlling Osmo pocket with it;I bought this as extension cord to control my DJI Osmo pocket with my android phone. The quality of the product is very good, the cord is heavy. It works well when I use it to charge my phone or Macbook pro. It also tansfers data between devices perfectly. When I usde it to connect my phone to control my Osmo pocket, it appeared to get connected for a second or so, then the connection would be lost. I then tried to adjust my phone usb connection to image or data transfer, it simply did not respond at all. I returned, for I only need it for controlling my Osmo pocket.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Charging cord;Broke after a month
3.0 out of 5 stars;It was fine when it worked for 3 months.  Now I’m past my return window!;It worked okay for three months.  Then it stopped working.  And now I’m out of the return window.  Makes me so mad that I’m stuck with a worthless cable that won’t charge my iPad Pro. So I went ahead and bought a genuine Apple 6 ft. USB-C charging cable at Target.  I hope this one lasts!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Fast charging cable (in 2022) but not as good as 2021;"*UPDATE 2023*The original review was given 1-star because it did not fast charge a Samsung phone but the same brand cable bought from 2021 did fast charge. However, I found out later that the phone's USB-C charger port was collecting dust/dirt/debris and needed to be cleaned (see below for how-to instructions), and after cleaning, any USB-C cable plugged into the phone charger port would be more sturdy and no longer wobbly/loose (originally thought it was the port going bad or physically damaged).So I retested the cleaned phone with the newer 2022 cable and sure enough it Fast Charges! Hence, review is updated from 1-star to 4-star, it loses 1 star because the older 2021 cable managed to fast charge a ""dirty"" port.HOW-TO-CLEAN-USB-C-PORT:You can do a Google or Youtube search ""how to clean phone usb-c port"", or here are brief instructions.1. Turn OFF your phone.2. Get a paper clip and bend it so that you have at least 0.5-1 inch of straight metal, or get any small metal pin but not too thick that will bend or touch the center piece sticking out of the USB-C port.3. Scrape along the gap of your USB-C port, avoiding the center piece of the port. Dirt/dust/debris collects inside the hole so that's why when you plug in any USB-C cable it will feel wobbly/loose instead of tight if the port was clean.4. Blow on the port now and then while cleaning to remove any loose dirt/dust/debris.5. Plug a USB-C cable in to test that it's now snug/tight instead of wobbly/loose, and you are done!*ORIGINAL REVIEW*Bought this same cable in 2021 (march) and it was fast charging, bought it again in 2022 (nov) and it is NO LONGER fast charging. The pictures will show the difference between the 2021 and 2022 versions, the 2022 slow charging cable's head is slightly darker blue/gray in color, and the inside of the USB plug is purple instead of black.Tested both cables using the same phone with the same power plug, all 6 of the new 2022 cables were SLOW charging. Very disappointed, because I recently bought a different brand which was suppose to be fast charging but was in fact slow charging, so I thought I would go back to these cables since they were fast previously... but clearly not any more."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works great when you find a compatible power source;UPDATE 2/8/2023: Didn't work at first on one power strip straight into USB, but did work on another. Also tried with a power brick and that worked on the original strip. So, if you have issues try a couple of different plugs.---------These don't work with my Samsung A23. Tried 2 in a power strip that another device is plugged into and working. Phone says replace cable but they are brand new.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works great but...;"Product works great and appears to have great durability.  Two items of note that may or may not be of concern to you.  First, there is a green LED at the charging end of the cord that is always lit.  I'm sure it uses a small amount of electricity but it's more than zero, as if it wasn't there.  Doesn't change color when charging, just lets you know it's plugged into the wall charger.  Second, the cord is not that flexible.  It bends and can be would up but not real small circles without it springing back straight.  Maybe 6"" circles is about the most it likes.  If you want higher durability and don't need to wind up the cord for storage this may be your winning choice.  Enjoy."

5.0 out of 5 stars;Great deal! Fast charging!;These work great with all of my devices!! Gave one to my son and one to my brother. Pay a lot more in any store for these!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great for the Cost, but not Fast Charging;With my old lightning cable it could fully charge my phone in 30 minutes. This one still takes the standard time to charge my phone, so around an hour and ahalf give or take. But for the price, it is what it is. Hard to beat having 5 charges so I won't complain too much.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great charger still working;Great chargers all five still work great
5.0 out of 5 stars;BEST CHARGING CABLES EVER;Hands down THE best most sturdy charging cable I've EVER used. Far superior to even the chargers that come with the phone! Highly recommended!!!👍⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good quality cable;Good quality cables at a more than fair price
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good;They look great. Heavy built.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Heads up;4 out of five were good
4.0 out of 5 stars;Worth every penny I paid;Cord length is perfect for the purpose I use for.  It looks sturdy but can't rate durability at this time.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great value, I did not rate durability yet because we have not used but for 1 day.;Love the length and charging power but durability has not be tested yet as we have only had them one day.
4.0 out of 5 stars;5 pack usb-c;Eating to see if they last
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great Customer Service;Charger worked great at first. Then after maybe a month it just randomly stops working and says my phone will take over 20 hours to charge. Customer service however, replaced it fully and they chargers are working great.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good;Good
4.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn’t work with all chargers;These cords won’t work with some chargers.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Second time purchasing;Braided wire adds durability. Just remember to use the correct wall adaptor!
5.0 out of 5 stars;The Best;Everything is good
5.0 out of 5 stars;All four cables work and are still working.;I like the cables mostly because they are still working and the price was good.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Built to last;Like the length and the re-enforced phone end.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Sometimes a bit stubborn;They like to spool up like a garden hose and pop out of my phone sometimes.  That can suck.  Also I kind of wish I'd gotten different colors.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works as described;Fast charging cords. The cords are well made and sturdy.
4.0 out of 5 stars;It fit the need but wasn’t that I expected;This is a package of 5 individual cords each with a type C end and USB. I was thinking that this was a single USB with five type C ends. It was needed for charging AA batteries at the same time.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Look nice. Fast charging? No dice.;I like the apparent quality of these cables.  Since we have 6 Android phones in our house, I wanted thisulti pack to have a couple backups.  The length of the cable and the quality ni am happy with.  My biggest issue, according to the product description was that it fast charges. it does not.  I have multiple fast charging bases and none of them make this cable charge faster.  Samsung fast charger, newer Samsung faster charger and even a new Belkin dual charging base will change the speed.  What's worse is, it actually charges slow.  I got a 10% charge in 30 minutes on this cable vs 90% on my shorter cables plugged into the same base.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Product works as described - speedy delivery;Product works as described, speedy delivery, would purchase again from this provider.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good overall;They were supposed to be fast charging but don't charge as fast as the manufacturer's cable. The length is good and the insulation is durable. Overall I like the product.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good chargers but small cord.;Good chargers they work but the cord length is very short.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Flexible and Cheap;"For the price, five cables that are six feet and braided is unbeatable. All cables worked as expected and prove to be quite durable when it comes to constant flexing. Only thing to note is I would not say they are ""fast charging"" only managing 3A but that was expected when purchasing."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Creppy face cables;I feel a little daunted by then with that face printed there! Do they want to conquer us?Otherwise cables are perfect. (After erase those creepy happy faces)
4.0 out of 5 stars;If you have the Pixel 6, you will need to remove your case to charge;I enjoy them for my Pixel 7 pro, my husband has to take his very basic case off to get his phone to charge.
4.0 out of 5 stars;1/5 does not work;The first chord from this pack that I opened did not work but the second one is working, I don't know about the other three yet. But the length is perfect.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good value, not durable;The protective metal sleeve dislodges and slides around.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Not very quick;This cable don't charge that well. They say that they are quick charging.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Affordable;Fast charging good. Length good. All good. Overall good. Buy more
5.0 out of 5 stars;GREAT PRODUCT;I bought these for me and family members. They love theirs and I love mine.  I can now charge my phone and still move about in my room while charging.  I would DEFINITELY recommend these.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great value;Very sturdy
4.0 out of 5 stars;good product;have not used them long enough to give a real review, but so far they are good
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great chargers;Can’t beat the price and work fantastic
3.0 out of 5 stars;Long cords;Long cords and sturdy however not fast chargkng
4.0 out of 5 stars;pretty good;I have 1 out of the bunch that's a little finicky on fast charging. sometimes it does sometimes it doesn't. For the price though I guess one shouldn't complain.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good cheap cables.;Used these for over a year with no problems at all.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Low Quality Charger Head;Not too much to say about it. its 6ft long and works, just unfortuante about the Usbc end having loosely attached casings. So the usbc end can bend easily if you don't pay attention to the little casing sliding off.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great value for 5;We've only had them a couple weeks and 1 out of the 5 stopped charging.***Update*** The company was very quick to respond to my review and sent a replacement.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Does not always charge device.;I just started using these cables and when you connect them to a device to charge it, it does not charge the device completely.  I thought the problem was with one cable, but I have the same problem with the entire batch of cables.  I used another brand of cable and they seem to work fine.I connect the cable to a charger and device and it shows connected.  A few minutes later, the charging process has stopped and when I reconnect the cable, it will not connect.Update (04/30/2022):  The vendor contacted me and replaced the original cables I ordered.  The new set of cables appear to be working as designed.  I'm pleased that the vendor stood behind its product and replaced them without any drama.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Was a very affordable price;So, far it's being one month and no complaints yet
3.0 out of 5 stars;waste money, not for fast charge.;These cables are not designed for fast charge.
3.0 out of 5 stars;I paid for a 5 pack and only received 4;Product works great but it says 5 but I only received 4
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good price, good quality;Can't comment on durability since I've only had them a few day but they work. Fast charge is working. Good price and it's a sturdy feeling cord. I've used 3 of them and they all are working.
4.0 out of 5 stars;comfortable length;Not too long.  Do not have to push excess wire out of the way.Not too short.  Do not have to sit next to an outlet.Cable looks and feels sturdy.
3.0 out of 5 stars;The charger lasted about 6mos;I feel that chargers is like buying a cheap used car. It is never going to last longer than a few mos. That's all I got.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good enough;Good length,  charges well.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Decent usb cords on the cheap.;I'd buy these again.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Es un cable resistente;The media could not be loaded.
3.0 out of 5 stars;What happened?;I purchased these twice before - they were great!  So great, in fact, that they all walked off with various family members.  I ordered them again, at nearly twice the price, and they are awful!  I have tried two of them today and my phone barely recognizes them.  It keeps asking if they are plugged into a power source!!  I have tried multiple sources, same results.  Barely charges, definitely not high speed.  I don't know what has happened, but they went from 5 stars to 1 star in my book.  3 for overall quality based on the older ones only.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works;Great product
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great deal;Saved me a bunch of money. Got 5 cords for half the price of one from best buy, or a gas station.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Love them;Affordable and fast love them
3.0 out of 5 stars;Great durability and length, but incredibly low charging speeds.;I have absolutely no idea why this charges so slowly, but it does work out for me as now I just leave my phone to charge overnight. This would be great for you if you want something like this, but if you want to charge your phone faster, then you should buy a different one but if you wanna leave your phone overnight, its a good deal!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Long chords;They do like they’re supposed to and so far my granddaughter hasn’t broke it which is a plus good job good job
3.0 out of 5 stars;good material, but no fast charging;good material, but no fast charging
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not consistent;We bought these to use in different locations throughout our house. They don't seem to last long and the charge is very inconsistent on them. Sometimes we get a fast charge, but mostly a slow charge. Disappointed with this product.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Shorter than advertised, weirdly...;"Of all the things about a charging cord that could be wrong, I never though it would be...  These ""6' long"" cords, aren't!  They're over 5', so it's not a huge difference, but, hey - size does matter!  :)Haven't had any issues with other aspects of the cords - plugs fit fine, durability seems okay after a couple of months of use, etc."
5.0 out of 5 stars;Make sure your power box is of good quality  as it is a powerful charging cord;Works greatUse a good brand usbc power supply box. And older one will get hot.Cord length appropriateSeems durable so farCan’t beat the price for a 5 pack of quick charge cords.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Stiff Cord, pro and con depending on need;Seems to charge fairly quickly, assuming you're using a fast charge power block.  As usual with cords, 6ft is more like 4ft usable, since cords and cables aren't generally pulled taut during charging, or leisure.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good for the price.;Pretty solid cables for the price, not a whole lot else to say.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Best cable for its price!;Great cable. It does tend to buch up and coild until you used it alot.  Best value as it works and cost much less compared to others.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Inconsistent;3 of 5 have stopped working after less than 1 month. They are barely moved each day and have no damage, they just stop working. And they do not charge quickly, even when connected to appropriate wall adapters and outlets.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Very Good;Love the cables. Very sturdy and holds a fast charge.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not as expected;Item said to be fast charging but it was not. It took about 6 hours to fully charge my andriod phone when my phone was at 25%.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great cables at a great price!;Durable cables, good length. Thicker than is typical so less likely to break due to loops, twists and kinks.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Too long to charge;Take to long to charge
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good price;Good prices for the amount of chargers. They come individually packaged which I liked to be able to store for when I actually need them.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Work, but don't last.;They work, but they don't last long.  I guess that's why you need so many.  I burned through these in no time.  Meaning, the fast charge capability is lost after a limited number of charges, and thereafter, it charges the device very slowly.  They didn't cost a lot, but I need fast charging.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Working Well;The order came quickly and is working as desired to allow fast charging to my android cell phone.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Wears quickly;Used these for about a month or so, but a few of them just stopped charging my devices. Haven't done anything wild with them, just typical use.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good thing there's more than one in the package.;I had a hard time getting my phone to charge. (Samsung galaxy s20 I think) tried another cord from the pack and it worked OK. I didn't use the factory wall plug so it didn't do super fast charging. They work but mine had at least one dud in it so far.
3.0 out of 5 stars;1 of the cords did not work. Casing slips off.;Used on my wife's and my cell phone. Didn't like I paid for 5 working power cords and only 4 worked.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Seems to work but it's not 10ft;I measured the very end of the metal charger from end to end and is only 9ft 9inchs. Seems to charge decent will update if something changes. Overall good product
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not the best cord. They work;They tend to charge erratically. Not great quality
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works as designed.;Works as designed.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Ends keep breaking;I have bought several times. The ends bend and break and don't hold a charge after awhile. I expected them to last longer. I re-ordered to give another shot and same thing happened.I just ordered others from a different company this week to replace them.
5.0 out of 5 stars;inexpensive cables that feel very solid.;They came in on time, with minimum excess packing, what i ordered, and when i expected it.  Hopefully they will prove as durable as they feel.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Average;Serve there purpose, but cheap
3.0 out of 5 stars;"DOES NOT ALWAYS SUPPORT ""LIGHTNING CHARGE""";The cords are great, but I notice that they do not consistently allow for a fast/lightning/rapid charge. You have to unplug it sometimes at least once or twice until your phone indicates the charge is in lightning mode. I had my phone discharge totally several times until I figured this out.  I kept them after figuring out this quirk!  It happened on both my cell and my wife's cell.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good value;I haven't tried all the cables in the pack yet, but the ones I did work.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Na;Na
3.0 out of 5 stars;Ok charger cord;I have purchased multiple cords in the past and never had issues. These don't seem to work with all usb c chargers.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Cords that last;These cords will last you a while, they worked really great right out of the package and have not worn down on the tips. Good buy
3.0 out of 5 stars;Seem well made, but time will tell;Just a bit stiff in use, not like you would expect braided cable to be..  note they don't work well on ALL our USB C devices.  the phones with a curve where the C port is does not allow the cable end to plug in fully it seems and if you bump the cable or phone while it's charging you can stop the charging action and not know it.  Seems like the metal end could be a touch longer or the plastic end be a bit shorter to work better.  Such a high rating by so many reviews has me wondering about build changes over the years.
4.0 out of 5 stars;It is not a fast charger;The length is great. Tight connection. Not a fast charger, and I thought it was.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Arrived quickly;Product arrived quickly and as advertised.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Be careful with the product info;Part of this is my fault.  I read a 5pack of 6ft cords.  When I received them they were 3 footers.  Went back to my order and realized there was an option to click on the 6 footers and for some reason the 6 ft are cheaper then the 3 footers which makes no sense.  Anyways I bought to fast without looking further into it. My fault and their fault.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good;Good
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great quality!!!;I am always hesitant to buy charging cables on Amazon because I know it costs much more than it should. I had a time crunch and needed some cables. I was more than pleasantly surprised at the charging speed, durability, and quality of these cables! They truly look and feel like they're going to last forever. I use phone cables in my hobby electronics projects, too, and I tested these with a multimeter and found no issues at all. Great product!
3.0 out of 5 stars;didn't fully charge?;"I gave this 3 stars because they seem durable and the price was a bargain, but it did not seem to work right for my purpose.  I used one to charge husband's hearing aids that I needed a cable longer than the standard one that came with the unit.  It uses the ""c to a"" cable so thought this would work for that purpose.  It did charge the hearing aids, light turned green indicating charge was complete, but the hearing aids died in the middle of the afternoon.  Typically they work the whole day without going dead, so for some reason these are not compatible to his charging unit.  Will probably return."
4.0 out of 5 stars;It works.;It is too early to tell overall, but it appears to be  more sturdy than the typical cords that come with a cell phone or tablet.  Why they want a person to rate something before one can really know is beyond me.  An early rating should only be a bad one for such a simple item.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great charging cords;Bought these because I had bought a bunch of cheaper cords that stopped working after a couple of weeks. After several months, these cords show no sign of problems. They are a great length and durable enough that they can be used constantly without worry of malfunction
4.0 out of 5 stars;Does it's job;So far so good
2.0 out of 5 stars;Glitchy with one of my tablets;These have been great, except... upon arrival, one of them would not charge one of my tablets. Gave a warning about moisture. I followed the instructions but it didn't matter, it always gave the same warning with this tablet. It charged the other tablet fine, so I let it go and used the others to charge that particular tablet. Months later, 3 of these cords are saying the same warning with this tablet, but the tablet charges fine on other cords. It's weird for sure, but only happens with these cords. So as long as it's not giving you a warning about moisture on some of your devices, they seem to work. However, it's rather annoying that I can't charge this tablet on these cords now. That was kind of the point in purchasing them.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Very nice feel.;We live around these cords.Why not buy a cord that looks nice?Feels nice?And isn't stiff as a board.These cords checks all the boxes.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Broke easily;I put it in my pocket to charge with my extended battery.  It damaged the type c part. Thought it was a bad core. But all 5 are crap.Update  only 2 we're broke 💔.  I'll give it 2 stars 🌟 🤩 ✨️ 😎 ♥️
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging;These are pretty durable and seem well made but they are not fast charging as the description says. I've tried multiple outlets with multiple plugs and have concluded these are in no way fast charging. They are actually pretty slow.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not for all phones;Charges well the portable chargers and beats, but does not connect well with Samsung phones
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging;Only a slight upgrade from the crappy cord I used to have. Definitely not fast - takes 4+ hours to charge my phone. My bfs charger can do it in under 2 hours, but he won't trade me. Lol
3.0 out of 5 stars;Great for 3 months;These work great for a while, within 3 months one stopped working and now 9 months later the only one out of 5 that still charges is the back up one for emergencies that has not been used until all 4 others have failed unless we got a bad batch of chargers would not recommend if you want longevity. Otherwise not worth it
3.0 out of 5 stars;Great for when you need a charger in a pinch;My original Samsung charger ended up breaking so I got these. They aren't terrible by any means (for the price at least) but I have a hard time believing they actually fast charge. My phone says it's fast charging but it takes longer than the old original fast charging cable. If you need fast charging I'd skip on these, if you just need a charging cable and no time restrictions, these will work just fine.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Right on the money!;The is the second time I have ordered this. I love them. Great product
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging;Ordered these for work, home and car. I first notices at work that it wasn't fast charging, I thought it was just from the dust at work so I paid a closet attention at home and that's when I noticed that it wasn't just a regular charger but it keeps disconnecting from my phone while charging. Naturally I grab my husband's phone at home, same thing. Next day at work I asked a coworker to borrow their phone and try it. For some reason if you charger wireless or direct it keeps pausing the charging process and the faster charging doesn't work. I also have tried with and without fast charger charging wall blocks to plug into.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Cheap;5 cord for 13 bucks was a steal, but the cords were all very bad, didn't not charge phone fast as advertised, and were pretty fragile. First day I received them they worked well,but on the they broke down and it would take am absurd amount of time to charge my phone, I'm talking 4, 5, with 2 of the cords saying 11 hours. But still not a bad price for 5 cords.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Acceptable cables;One cable out the five pack did not work correctly. Also my phone could not draw a full power charge when using these cables and plugged into a Ford truck. Length is great and durability OK after a few months of normal everyday use.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Excellent High Powered Charging Cable - NOT STANDARD Charging Capable;This cable is excellent as long as you are using a higher voltage / high speed charging base.  If you are using a standard usb charging base such as the ones you would find in a WalMart, Home Depot, common stationary store, or if you attempt to use the usb that's built into a standard wall outlet or splitter, you will be  sadly disappointed.  For the most versatile cable, do not buy a 'High Speed' cable.  Purchase a well made 'Standard Cable'.  This way you will be able to use it in public locations such as the airport/planes, or the coffee shop.  This cable has a specific requirement that may not always be available to you if you leave your 'High Speed Base' at home or work by accident.
3.0 out of 5 stars;One cable broke after a few days of use;I bought these in bulk because these cables don't last forever, but the first one I put to use lasted about a week before it would no longer charge my device, turns out it was a faulty plug end.So far the others I've put to use have worked much longer. But a quick failure isn't a great sign.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Charging power;To charge my devices
3.0 out of 5 stars;it works...sort of;These work sort of. They are not fast charger. Have found after use they do not want to stay plugged into my phone. Should have spent the extra money for better ones. These is will work but wouldn't buy them again.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Extra length makes charging tablets more convenient.;Awesome extension for tablet charging.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great buy...;Thick, durable cords that don't bend at the tip easily.  I go through replacement charging cables for my phone like water. So I'm constantly ordering new ones.  These seem to last a while.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good purchase;I've only used 1 cord thus far. But they came exactly as described. They seem to be good quality that should last longer than some of the cheap, thin chords. Just remember that they don't come with a charging block, in case you need one. I'm very happy with it so far. If anything changes, I'll update my post.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Does not last;I really like the obvious indicator so I know which way is “up” when inserting this into my computer, but the cord stops working after only 100-300 hrs of use. It doesn’t physically look broken but my Xbox controller disconnects with increasing frequency until I switch it out. Doesn’t matter which end I unplug and plug back in so it’s not from wear and tear.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Loose Connection;I have a Samsung S9. After a month, one of the cords won't charge phone because the connection is loose.  Another cord won't connect fully to my daughter's pad and charge it. Cost is low and cords seems to be about the same quality as you would get from dollar type stores.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great charger;Loved the multi pack a and the cord length
5.0 out of 5 stars;They charge fast and are durable.;I am a truck driver and I am constantly going through c cords for my cell phone. Quality just isn't what it used to be, eh? But the truck stops charge exorbitant amounts of money for sub par quality cords. Ive had these now for united some time and they charge quickly. I tested this by plugging the cord into my battery pack an then into my 15% phone. My phone advised of cable charge and that it would be fully charged in 1 hr 20 mins. I used the truck stop cord and it advised for the same 15% that it would be fully charged in 2hrs 30 mins. Yeah. Im sold. Im getting these cords in 3ft, and 10ft lengths. Sold.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Short Durability;This charger does not last really long, each of mine only last for 6 - 10 weeks
2.0 out of 5 stars;Terrible cords;Bought these cord because they look like ones i bought previously,  but they look like good cords. however,  they will not stay plugged into phone charging port.  Any movement or vibration and the cords fall out.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Half of them didn’t work;Purchased about four months ago and first impression these seems great. I currently have two cords left standing out of the entire pack. Some didn’t even work straight out of the package. Now I’m on the hunt yet again…. The struggle of charger cords. I gave two stars for my two charger cords that are still going strong.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not durable. Outside looks strong but inside isn't very durable. Goes bad in a few months;Not durable. Outside looks strong but inside isn't very durable. Goes bad in a few months
4.0 out of 5 stars;So far they have been good;It's a fast charging cable and so far they are still working
4.0 out of 5 stars;Charges fast!;Charges fast!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Convenient!;With the amount that comes with this, really convenient, couple in the house, one in the car, couple spread out on other travel bags or something. Only thing I wish these had was more length. Everything else is great
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good;Good length and price. Durable
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great product;Product is exactly as advertised.
4.0 out of 5 stars;They are good but will not fit in all chargers.;They do not fit in all chargers
4.0 out of 5 stars;Better review will come through practical use;I need a few months to practically test this product but so far I'm as happy as I can be with it.
4.0 out of 5 stars;USB A to USB C Cable;Item was received as expected in good condition.  These work fine but they don't have the grip to stay in the USB C end like I'd expected.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Very short useful life;I always wait a while to place reviews.  I bought these last August.Durability and workmanship can only be measured after substantial use.  Nice to have a quantity of 5 long cords, but perhaps the reason they give you five is they know they don't last long.  The first cord I pulled from the pack began losing connectivity where it plugs into the phone after a few months use.  The second lost it's turbo and started charging slowly after a month.  The third did the same after 2 months.  After setting my expectations low on cord number 4, it lasted a surprising 4 months but then lost connectivity recently.  Cord 5 is in use as of July 2022.  I use these to recharge a single cell phone.At the present rate, I will burn through all cords in about a year.  Compare that to the recharge cord provided with the phone that is still delivering a good connection and turbo recharge with no problems for the past 18 months.  I took a close look at both cord connections to the phone.  It is clear these cords show noticeable wear after a couple months while the 18 month old Motorola cord has none to mention.  They also fit more loosely even when right out of the box.  Amazon recommends this product.  Obviously they have not tested itClearly the workmanship on these cords is sorely lacking.  It's too bad because they look and feel solid...they just serially fail way too soon.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Defective cord;One of the charging cords of this 5-pack is defective. Does not charge my cell phone at all. The other four cords are fine.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good Product;Nice construction
5.0 out of 5 stars;It works as it should;I like the cord
5.0 out of 5 stars;not one broke!;I'm a very accident-prone person, and with such I needed this pack to not have to order a new charger every month. I've had this pack for months now, and not a single one has broken!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Work okay, not perfect;One cable didnt work, but i have not tested in multiple devices yet.  The other ones have a bit of a hard time staying plugged in phone, they pop out easy.  My other cables don't have that issue.Not sure if it's a dirty port on my phone, or cavle issue.
3.0 out of 5 stars;They're Pretty, but they're JUNK;Good looking cable that's junk. With very light use, half of them have already been thrown in the trash. The ends have loose connections, although from the outside they look great!I won't buy these again.
2.0 out of 5 stars;These cords suck;I have Moto 5G 2022 when I have an actual fast charge usb type-C 5v 3.1 ampvwire my phone will register as turbo charging! this company claims fast charge but my phone isn't reading them as turbo charge so with that said they maybe 5v but they ain't 3.0 amp that's for sure 5 out of 5 of these cords do not say I'm turbo charging! (which they should) so it's definitely the company's b.s. not just a single cord that was bad. I even Payed extra for same day shipping for this crap I'm not happy with them at all.
2.0 out of 5 stars;These aren't that good...very disappointed!!!;I was excited to get these. They feel sturdy but the end doesn't stay in my phone and it does NOT seem to be fast charging. I am very disappointed. I hate to leave bad reviews and I wanted these to be great because they look good but if they don't work right...what's the point??? Kind of bummed about this.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Hard to connect;Cord heavy, quite durable, nearly too bulky not pliable. One of our phones plug port won't connect to and 2 phones hard to connect or plug in. It's states not supported charger or a knock off on phone screen. Great price but I'll probably send the 5 back. (we have 6 phones in household)
2.0 out of 5 stars;Good length, bad ports;"The length was good, they were what I was needing and happy with that part. The unfortunate part was when I tried using and plugging the usb-c part into my phone it read ""bad connect, slow charge, check connection"" due to what I feel may be a simple factory mishap in production due to the actual usb-c metal part being shorter than needed to fit into the phone correctly and charge how it is supposed to. It was 3 out of the 5 that were that way, so not all of them, but still unfortunate.  The other two that were properly made work great."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Not very flexible;LOVE the length, hate the stiffness.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charging speed;"Don't expect  these to  charge at  the full capacity  of a type ""c"" port.  These are derated due to the wire size inside.  Great durability. Not great for charging  fast rapid or any of that"
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good deal;One quit working after a few weeks. But other than that so far so good
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charge;Slow charge time. It does charge but bot as a fast charge cord. And it is attached to a fash charge wall adapter. I have rebooted phone to see if it was an issue on my end. It wasn't. If you need a charger this will work especially for 5 cords but dont plan on it being fast
4.0 out of 5 stars;Worth the money.;It’s good value pack if you need multiple cords.
2.0 out of 5 stars;NOT what most of Us are Looking For;These are really strong cords, really packaged nice BUT for MOST of Us I am sure these are NOT the connections we are looking for. We have a LOT of USB charged products in Our home, a LOT, and NONE of them fit the ends to these. I don't even know what these are for! Be careful, if You, like Us are regular electronic users because almost guaranteed, despite the picture looking like what You need, it is NOT . These are wider at the ends and fit NOTHING that I have found yet. Again, do NOT buy unless You are SURE this is what You need, because I searched and googled and looked at pictures and these do NOT fit my phone, my camera, my JBL speaker, earbuds,....ANYTHING!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Meh;"Fresh out of the pack I got the ""slow charging please use original charger"" on my android with and without the case on it. Once I flip it a few times it will charge normally. My phone is only a few months old so it isn't the charger port itself. I used another brand cable and did not have this issue."
3.0 out of 5 stars;doesn't fast charge my OnePlus 6;It does charge, does transfer data (I think, can't remember) But doesn't fast charge. Feels quality other than that. If you don't need fast charging perfect cable.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charge or bad connection;"I purchased these in June and and gave 3 months to verify before posting my review. I had based my purchase on the great rating and reviews, but the product I received has been a disappointment. The kids kept telling me their phones weren't charging etc so I started using the cords. I get a ""check your charger connection "" warning even thought thr cord us properly plugged in. Even when I do not get a warning, the charge is very slow and takes hours longer than my other cables."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great product;I like the cords being so long and they plug in tight
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works great;These are durable and seem to work just fine. The charging is slower but I also am using them with a multi port charger so I don't know if that makes a difference.  Perfectly satisfied.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Breaks pretty easy;Bought these for my vehicles and Android auto.  None work for that now in about 3-4 months.  Definitely don't wear well... probably be fine for the house.
3.0 out of 5 stars;NOT a Data cable.;I only realized these cables are explicitly for charging only after I purchased them and attempted to link two devices together with them, and got no communication. They do not make this clear in the description.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Durable and well made but too slow;Very slow charging speed. My phone has 25% of charge right now, I plugged it to charge using this cord and it shows that in 2 hours and 46 minutes it will reach 100% of charge. Too slow
3.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't last;Love the length. They don't last. I needed all six for every few months one died.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging;I like the durability and length of the cord,  it works very well for my kids tablet but it's not fast charging at all. I've tried several fast charging bases still no less than 2hrs to fully charge tablet
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good quality;Good quality cable, not as flexible as I would like.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Loose engagement;Charger works great when plugged into my phone but a major inconvenience is the plug doesn't stay firmly engaged in the charging port and falls out/disconnects pretty often
4.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't seem to be a fast charge;I wondered if my phone would charge faster with this cable. So I plugged my phone into my old cord, the phone said 1hr 20min until fully charged. I plugged in one I just purchased, it said 1hr 50 minutes until fully charged.
4.0 out of 5 stars;They work as expected;I like the length and they fast charge.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Make sure you know what length you want. I didn't.;Wish I had gotten longer cords.
3.0 out of 5 stars;i havent had it plenty time;lent is perfect , charging time seems little slow.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charge but they all work;They all work but they all slow charge our devices. No data either. But they're cheap and they work 🤷🏼‍♂️ took off the shield on the c-end because it interferes with device cases
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good;Good
3.0 out of 5 stars;Takes forever to charge;The cords are great and durable but they don't charge as fast as they should. It takes 4-5 hours to get my phone charges with these but given the price and howanu cords I got I'm not complaining
4.0 out of 5 stars;The cords work good.;The cables work good they seem to hold up well over the 4 weeks that I have Been using them.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Going to buy more;I'm the biggest cord guy in the city. I know cords like I know my children. These is some cords I would recommend buying.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good Deal;Good Deal
3.0 out of 5 stars;Price is good but not kid proof;We have not found a charging cord that is kid proof the code is very good and they last and the price is good we have not found a charging cable that is kid proof so we will keep buying these cords until we find a cord that is kid proof lol
5.0 out of 5 stars;Exactly as Advertised;Fast charging, great length, everybody can charge now. Goes great with a 12-18 outlet surge protector with usb ports
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great deal.;Great deal. I wish they had a higher amp option. They don't feel like they will break anytime soon. Now I have one for most rooms in my place.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good;Decent quality. Nice and long charger cords. They work.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging without proper adapter;Good product but will not fast charge unless you have a proper adapter.
3.0 out of 5 stars;2 stopped working in a month.;2 of these stopped charging within a month. No damage to the cords at all.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging at all;These are supposed to be fast. They are not fast. Actually, the ones I got at the dollar store are faster. Cord length is good, though. But I won't be buying these again.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Some of them stay in the phone, Some dont.;The Bad: I ordered these because I obviously needed more charger cables. Once I received them, I opened them up and started using them. The very first thing I noticed was that the end that goes into the phone wouldn't fit inside of the hole for the charging port. So I then cut the hole bigger so I can use it. After all said and done, 3 out of the 5 I got, wont stay in the phone when's its charging. I thought it might be my phone and tried my wife's phone, which Is identical to mine, and I got the same results. Our phones are only, maybe, 6 months old. So its not the phone's.  The 2 good ones will stay in the phone like the charging cords we got with the phone. If you wanna use your phone while its charging then dont buy these.The good: When I use these cord's with the fast charging transformer, they actually do fast charge my phone. The quality of the cord is good. The length of the cord is good. The 2 good cords I got stay in and charging while Im playing on my phone.  The overall durability of them seem good, but I havent had them long enough to know 'how' durable they really are.In my opinion, next time Im honna spend more money and get a better cable.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good for the price, almost as good as a quick charge cable;No problems or issues with any of the cords. And works good with quick charge
3.0 out of 5 stars;good chargers but don't expect to get the color you ordered;I received the wrong color chargers TWICE so don't buy if you're expecting to get a specific color. After them failing for the second time I just decided to keep the wrong color and the chargers seem to work fine for now. Good length and charge fast.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Don’t work;I’ve tried two out of the pack of five and both charge at a snails pace, to the point where I can’t use the computer while charging. Additionally, I don’t know why this happens but so far it has only been when I’m using these chargers, my applications just stop working or quit. It isn’t the computer, when I use my normal Apple charger it’s fine I’m truly at a loss. I wouldn’t recommend these if you plan to use them for any kind of work.
1.0 out of 5 stars;No good for data transfer;Every single one of these cables gives a *device* disconnected error at random times while trying to transfer data.  The issue persists across 2 Pixel 7's, a Pixel 6, a Galaxy S21 and an S22 and occurs on 4 different PC's and a Mac.  Based on the inconsistent performance for transferring data I'm throwing all of these out an ordering replacements from another brand.  I'm not sure if it's just one pin, of if the power is also coming and going, but I'm not willing to buy a new phone to save a few bucks on cables.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging 😒;Not fast charging 😒
2.0 out of 5 stars;Stay away. Won't support fast charge. Clearly missing pins.;This is a get what you pay for story. Won't charge a Galaxy device faster than a trickle. Looks and feels decent quality, but that's not what I need cables for.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Decent price and quantity;Good quality, fast charging.
2.0 out of 5 stars;They don't last long;The shorter ones.  So far, I haven't used the longer ones for the same amount of time.  The shorter ones, I use in my car to hook my phone up to Android Auto and after awhile, they lose the connection frequently.
2.0 out of 5 stars;The cables constantly unplugs.;None of the cables will stay in my phone, keep falling out Samsung Galaxy.
2.0 out of 5 stars;NOT A RAPID CHARGER;This is a nice long charger but DEFINITELY NOT a fast rapid charger as described.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great Quality;recommend
3.0 out of 5 stars;Works with my Samsung phone / not with iPad Air;I like everything except that my iPad Air will not charge using this cord. And yes, I tried every possible combo of adapters and outlets.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Already stopped working;Only had these for a few weeks and the first one I used has already quit working. ☹️ at least you get multiples for the price!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Maybe an anomaly...;"These have worked great for months, but just the other day, one of the cables ""fried"".  It was connected to the charger on one end, which is typical to keep that side plugged in, but not connected to my phone or anything else on the other.  It just started sizzling and smoking.  I immediately unplugged it.  I have since used other cables in that same charger, so charger is OK.  Glad I was around it when did this.  If no one else has ever seen this, then it was probably just an anomaly.  Rest of the cables have worked for months with no issue!"
5.0 out of 5 stars;It was great;I loved it
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not Fast Charging;The length is awesome. What isn't awesome is that it's descrias fast charging...no, they arent.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Short;Could be longer, could charge faster
3.0 out of 5 stars;Takes forever to charge yoir device;If you are looking for fast charging, DO NOT get these.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Pretty Good;"While these are definitely not the thickest or most heavy-duty USB-C charging cables I have owned they are definitely the least expensive I have seen for ones that are rated for fast charging. The braiding is of good quality. The cable thickness is noticeably slimmer than other ""premium"" fast charging cables I own though. There really is not anything in the way of stress relief on the connectors either, which will definitely shorten their lifespan. Still, I can't complain much as they are far, far cheaper than most of the others I have purchased."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Decent cables for charging phones on the wheels;Both my wife and I have android devices with Type C charging port.  We were tired of carrying our original charging cable back and forth all the time. Since we travel a lot in our car, we thought it would be a good idea to have a spare charging cable specifically meant for charging the phone while on the road.We have been using this for the last couple of days and it seems to be decent so far. Since the charging speed depends on either the charging head and not the cable itself, I have not seen any drastic change st the speed at which it charges. But, it serves the purpose it was bought for.
4.0 out of 5 stars;2 weeks in no problems...;2 weeks in no problems...
2.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't last long or charge fast;Took around a month for my first charger to have a problem with the cable and it never was fast the cable
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not made for fast chargers;Ive used this cables with my 3 different fast chargers and they just dont work as some other cables that do make my chargers work as they should
5.0 out of 5 stars;Very well constructed.;Heavy duty cable, and metallic shield at the connector.These work great with my Samsung Lightning chargers.
3.0 out of 5 stars;They don't work very well;These cables look nice, but they don't charge very well. I've had them for about 3 months now and they started out fine, with the exception that on the second day of using it, the cable caused my phone to overheat and shut down to the point it wouldn't turn back on. About 30 minutes later after unplugging it and allowing it to sit, I finally got my phone to power back on. The phone had 40% battery when it did this, so it's not because the phone died due to lack of power. Now a few months later, they won't effectively charge my phone in the car or even if plugged into the wall. I've even tried it on my laptop. When I plug my phone in, it doesn't even recognize that it's plugged in. The charging light and lightning bolt don't show up at all. It might appear for a second and then it's gone. I've changed out the brick for the wall and the charger in the car and it always seems to be the cable. The same brick or car unit works just fine for my husband's phone cables. Yesterday, while attempting to get some tiny charge in the car, the cable caused my phone to shut down again. Thinking that maybe it was the one cable out of the pack of five, I rotated to a new cable and every single one of them have this issue. Like I said, they look nice, great material and all, but they don't actually charge anything effectively.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Didn't last too long;All six chords are no longer working just shy of a year after purchase. They worked great while they lasted. Disappointing to have to replace them all.
4.0 out of 5 stars;No problem so far. I’m liking these a lot;Timely shipping, seems to be the perfect length
3.0 out of 5 stars;Lasted Six Months;These were fine while they lasted, which was about six months. I'm disappointed and will try a different brand.
5.0 out of 5 stars;I'm a huge fan of roped chargers!;The last set of roped chargers I had lasted over THREE years before losing and/or the rope started to slide down the cable. I have 1 that still works but they're discontinued so I had to find another set. The quality of these remind me so much of my last set so I'm confident they will last more than a year :).I can't comment on the fast charging because my phone has a known glitch where it doesn't fast charge - terrible, I know! But, it tells me how long it would take to charge and I compared it to my last charger set and it was the same so I'm happy!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Does NOT fast charge.;Does not fast charge. Sometimes it says fast charging for a moment when you first plug in but changes to normal right after.  Very misleading to advertise it as fast charging. Would have purchased something else if I knew. Otherwise good quality braided cords at a great price.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Unfortunate durability or quality control;I am an engineer who uses these cables to flash code I've written on to different devices.of the 5 that I received, 2 of them have stopped functioning as proper data cables.  They still offer power to devices but the communications are broken.This is annoying because I don't put these through any day to day strain - they just stay at my workstation plugged in to my computer...  It would be more understandable if I was packing them into a backpack or something every day.While they work, they do work however.  For a charging cable I like the length, look, texture of the product enough. Just wish they worked for communications/signals a little more reliably.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Kinda nice;So far the 2 out 5 that I'm using are pretty nice and doing the job.
4.0 out of 5 stars;You get what you pay for.;Overall good product for the price, but don't expect it to last forever. I find myself having to replace these wires every 6-7 months.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Seating connectors is iffy.;When I plug the phone into the car, I have to make sure I'm getting good electrical connection.  So far, if I carefully wiggle the connectors, I get it to charge.
3.0 out of 5 stars;One slowed down a few months in;Overall been happy with the brand, and got a number of cables from them. This particular pack one of them suddenly stopped supporting regular charging. Only charge super slow. Others work fine with regular use. Good to be aware though.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Works great until it doesn't;Worked great while it lasted. The length is great! My lifestyle may be the factor why it didn't last however these are the only chargers so far that don't last that I've bought.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Appears well made;Appears well made.  Check back in a year and see if they still work.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good cable good price;Nice product sturdy but stiff. Doesn't feel like it will break easily but also holds shape so it gets caught on things when charging.
5.0 out of 5 stars;19 months and still working;"These are very good USB-C cables. I purchased this product in March of 2019. At the time of this review it is Oct. 2020. Other cables I've used on my Motorola phone fit loosely and would disconnect. It has been 19 months and these still make a firm connection and I don't have to worry about my phone not charging. They are showing little signs of wear and the ""TurboPower"" fastcharging function of my phone works whether plugged into the ""Power IQ"" compatible adapter in my car, or plugged into the wall charger supplied with my phone."
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not so great;Didn't last long at all before it stopped working
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works;Works
3.0 out of 5 stars;Decline Charge;This charger started off so wonderful.  Slowly it stopped working.  I got 2 good month in.  Let me add they were stationary the entire time.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Quality and durability;Wires are still charging great till this day. The quality of the connection pull sucks though. They become loose or fall off over time. Other then that its pretty durable.
5.0 out of 5 stars;good vValue;Does what they are supposed to do.  I have 4 kids, so its almost impossible to find my phone cable, as someone is always misplacing theirs and finding my cable in the block, tethered it is supposed to be.This set allows me to have a good chance of having a charger in my car and at the office and a spare one.Color coded , for easier thief detection
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not 6ft;Ok this is misleading. It's not 6ft. Dissapointed.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Look good and working great so far! Awesome price on a quality cord.;Look good and working great so far! Awesome price on a quality cord.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Get what you pay for;They look nice, but had one start having issues after 2 weeks of use. Get what you pay I guess! It loses connection with my phone in the car if jostled.
2.0 out of 5 stars;STIFF, SO FREAKING STIFF;Cords work as designed but are miserable to use if you need to use your device while plugged in. They get all twisted up like a garden hose. WAY TO STIFF.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good;When purchased I didn't notice that they were a 5 pack so that's a plus but I have had an issue with one if them not wanting to work correctly, in all still worth it
4.0 out of 5 stars;great value for cables;I am fairly satisfied with these other than they were not as durable as I had hoped for. 2 of them broke within a couple of months. ALTHOUGH they were in the back seat of the truck with the kids whom didn't bother to not step on them or move them out of their way.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Product is okay;Did not like the material it was made of!
2.0 out of 5 stars;They fall out of a Pixel 3;These USB Type C charging cords are awful. They fall out of a Google Pixel 3. I mean you plug it in and leave it alone. Come back in 15 minutes or so and the cord is disconnected from the device. Does not matter if the phone has a cover on it or not.It is maddening. Also seems to not charge at times.I would not buy again and wish I would not have bought previously.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't last. Phone says use the cable you phone came with. Charges really slow.;Doesn't last. Phone says use the cable you phone came with. Charges really slow.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Bad quality;At first few days of using the cable was quite good. It was fast charging my s22 and there was no issue,cable felt very ridged and connection to the phone was solid and strong. After some time this metal cover(SMALLElectric text) of the type C side of the cable came off. As you can see it in the photos it was glued very poorly on the rubber of the cable. I was okay with this as the cable was still functioning well.after some more time of using cable it started to loose connection with the phone and was slow charging the phone. I threw the cable away and used another one as I order 5 of them. after 1 week of use same thing happened with the second cable. I am very disappointed.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Sturdy cables;Cables always breaking and losing them. So far these are pretty solid. I bought a couple packs of the 3' and 6' cables. Should never run out now.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Updated - Sturdy but not fast charging;"Updated 10/11/18:Seller contacted me and sent out a new set of cables. They were just as sturdy and stiff at the first bag. I'm sure the things would take quite the beating because they really are quite tough.I've still had mixed results with them. Sometimes they fast charge, but it won't come up on the phone as ""fast charging"", but I can swap to an older type C cable and the charge time jumps up by 45 minutes or so, but I can plug one of these back in and the time drops by quite a bit, but still not ""fast charging"".I've updated my review to 3/5 ""it's okay"" because they really are VERY sturdy, and they do seem to charge well, but the fact they don't register as ""fast charging"" leaves me a bit put off. The customer service has been very good, and I would buy from the sellers again (just not this item).The cables are very sturdy, almost too stiff. The reason why I am giving it a bad rating is because they are NOT fast charging, or at least the ones I got weren't. Maybe 1 out of 5 will actually fast charge, and sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. I can user any of my other cables and it's fine, but these do not fast charge for me."
2.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charging;"Charging on these are really slow. I have them plugged into the surge protector I use with all my other USB chargers.  I even get the ""slow charger"" warning when I plug my phone in."
2.0 out of 5 stars;Fast charging fire hazard;New review!! As of July 27th, one of the cables actually did start smoking as it was charging my phone! I'm not sure if it was the charger itself or the cable but 1 out of 5 has already started malfunctioning. Luckily, my phone was in my hand when it started so I was able to unplug it!I saw some bad reviews about fire hazards and burning charging ports, so I was a little skeptical and reluctant, but I'm happy to say I haven't had any issues!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good Solid Cables;I really like the cables. The charging power is as if I had the original cable and adapter. The cables were fit really well in the charging port. I mention this because sometimes the after market cables fit loosleyand won't get a good charge. They charge very fast and we'll made. I anticipate they lasting a long time if used properly. Definitely a good buy!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Great cords but 2 didn't work.;2 of the cords didn't work but customer service help me with the issue.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works great, stiff but well built and durable;Great for a rugged environment. Stiffer than you expect but much better constructed than your typical cable.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Did not stay attached to phone, low charging power;I don't really review things but these were, sadly, disappointing.My phone was low battery when I first got these. When I plugged in the first 2 chargers to my phone galaxy S8, the phone said that it would take 25+ hours to charge my phone. Even unplugging them and plugging them back in, every time it would say 25+ hours.The next 2 chargers said 3+ hours and that is 2x as long as I'm used to for this phone.Only the final charger worked when plugging it in, but it would not charge my phone unless it was snugly attached to the phone.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not a long term solution for gaming;I think it's fair to say that nothing good last forever and these cables are a embodiment to that. I've used these cables (6ft/2m) for a few months now for charging my phone and it gets the job done but when comes to gaming with my ps5 controller it doesn't work well. After maybe 2 months the fabric on the cable gets worn out and doesn't keep my controller connected to my pc. And yes I know that xbox controllers are better because they made for pc but I like the feel of the ps4/5 better but these cables don't allow for that long term. So yeah, find a more reliable cable.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Product meets requiremenets;Cables meet requirements, fast charging and data transfers.  Overall quality is excellent
3.0 out of 5 stars;Decent cables, but too stiff;The cables charge my devices, I get fast charging on Samsung devices with an approved power brick. I just don't like how stiff and rigid the cables are. I get that may indicate quality, but it doesn't work for my charging station.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Love these;Hey are thick cords and super durable. They are my go to changing cord!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Meh;If you use a case, the charger end is so wide it won't fit past my cast to plug into phone!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Worked for a few days.;Worked for a little while, but now every time I plug my phone in it says moisture detected.  I can use a different and one and it does not say that.  I tried all 5 of these and they all make my phone say moisture detected.  Cannot use.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good charger;Works just like it's supposed to. Durable than most chargers
5.0 out of 5 stars;I would but again;Better than buying from store and super good price on
5.0 out of 5 stars;College Student approved!;These do a great job! I have one in every room and they are totally worth it
3.0 out of 5 stars;LOOSE CONNECTION;They have a very loose connection , one didn’t work at all. You get what you pay for these are very cheap so expect cheap quality . Charge okay tho
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good cords;Doesn’t really fast charge but great value
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good for money but lacking durability;Data transfer stopped working with this specific cord since only a couple months of use.Charging still mostly works, but don't expect to get a lot of work out of it.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Worst charging cable ever;Those are the worst cable I bought in my life, at the beginning I was doubtful that the charging issues are from adapter but as soon as I tried another cable I became sure that the issue is the cable itself. I tried all the different ones received but they all have the same problem: they don't fit correctly into the USB-C port to be able to charge the phone you need to hold the cable by hand and this is while the phone is without the case. They definitely need to review the design, a long 10ft cable without the right sized port is not enough.I am planning to return these asap.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Durability;The length of was shorter than I expected that was my fault for not getting a longer size
1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesnt support fast charge, have tried with more than 1 phone;It looks nice and everything and it's long but becuase fast charging doesn't work for all 5 cables I got, it can take you a whole day for the phone to charge. So, waste of money.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Cord;Cord
3.0 out of 5 stars;Less that 3 weeks;Was very excited at first...less than 2 weeks in and 1 has gone out/not charging. We only started using 3 when we got these. So since 1 went out, we are now using a 4th.I'll update if more go out....
2.0 out of 5 stars;USB C plug doesn't fit into phones well;I was very happy with the shipment, the lengths, durability, etc.  However, they have never plugged well into the USB C port on our phones (two different Galaxy 10 phones).  Every one of these cables has to be pushed in as far as they can go, and can't be off center in anyway or I get an error on the phone that the cord is not connected properly.  All other brand cables I've gotten (including the ones that come with the G10 phones) work every time with no issue whatsoever.  There is never any concern with them on whether they are connected properly.  With these, it looks like I'll have to revert to wireless charging until I find another brand that has the six foot cables.  It may work fine with other brand phones (maybe even different Galaxy phones--we have a G10 and a G10e) so can only speak to these.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Extremely slow charge;I bought these wires some time ago. They are either all defective or they are just bad. I tried Charging my iPad, and it takes a full 5 hours to fully charge. And if I try to watch something or read a book on my iPad, it actually does not charge fast enough and my iPad still loses charge, while “charging”.
3.0 out of 5 stars;These are stiff.;I was hoping that these would a little more flexible than the ones that came with factory products. They are well made but stiff can't make them lay flat and they don't like to coil. For the price and if you don't care how stiff a cord is no problem. But they work.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good Charger Cable;My 5 year old daughter consistently breaks here Fire HD cable.  This value pack is great!  Not nearly as sturdy as the original charging cable that came with the value is worth it.  I assume it will change any other type of C type device.
2.0 out of 5 stars;UGH;I have had nothing but problems with these cords.  They all went from staying connected to the device to being lose or not connecting all the day in just a couple of months.  I have tried other cords on the devices to make sure its not the device, NOPE, its the cord.  I was have been really disappointed that I have to jiggle and wiggle and it just right to get it to stay charging.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Low quality;I ordered these as sticking suffers for everyone in our house and of the 3 that have been put into use since Christmas... all have stopped working. It's a major let down and i won't be ordering anything from this supplier in future.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Per5;Just as advertised and work great
2.0 out of 5 stars;2 out of 4 had a loose fit;I bought these six months ago. One of the four immediately had a loose connection to my phone. If the phone was moved slightly the connection tended to be broken. Another one developed that same problem a few months later. Note that the problem is not my phone. Other charging cables fit well, and I have the same problem with the bad cables on two different phones. So far that's a 50% success rate. I don't recommend this product.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Get the job done;Not much to say. They're charging cables that charge.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Should offer vary length but quality is good.;Could have offered vary length instead of all five being same length.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Somewhat disappointing;With a fast charging brick I couldn't barely get regular charging much less fast charging. Super embarrassed I gave one to a co-working touting it as a fast charging cable. (So I couldn't return without full package). Live and learn I guess.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Unreliable, but good for price.;After about 3 weeks of use, you will have to keep unplugging and plugging back into phone/outlet, etc. to get it to charge correctly.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Great ONLY AT FIRST;These cables were great but they only lasted a couple weeks each. They all eventually lost to keep up the charge or they connection internally was damaged that they had to forced into side pressure to charge, the outer casing fell off on some though that did not interfere with charging. I  would only buy these if you have an event were many might need to charge their phones so that that you don't worry if they take them because of how great  they were for their length.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Quality USB C cords;Great product. They function as intended and haven’t failed us. What more could we want?
5.0 out of 5 stars;These are the best cords I have  used;The reliability
4.0 out of 5 stars;Large stiff cables, but good quality;Cables are not as flexible as what I prefer but good quality
3.0 out of 5 stars;USB C connection does not stay in Pixel phone;4 of the cables are useless 3 will lose connection if the phone is moved at all, 1 does not connect at all for data and one works. Pixel phone is fairly new and the cables that came with it stay very secure even connected while driving in car using android auto.Update: I cleaned my charging port with alcohol and a toothpick and the cables connect well now. One cable does not work at all but 4 out of 5 are fine.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great replacement cables.;I purchased these cables for my new Samsung Galaxy S8 phone. The braided cordage is thick and strong. And the connectors fit snug in my phone. With these, I was able to replace one of my indoor cables, one for my car, and another for my portable charger. The fourth will be kept with my travel gear and the 5th will be a backup.I am pleased at their performance so far. I have a couple chargers that support 'fast' charging and these cables work with them very well. Only a few tines have I seen a message of 'slow charging' and easily remedied the situation by pulling out and reinserting the cable.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Best purchase;Fast charging, sturdy and has last me longer than all I've ever bought. My very best purchase and will order again.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works great;I recently got a new phone that uses the C charger. Since the phone itself only came with 1 cord, I definitely needed more cords. I bought one at a gas station and it is hit and miss when I decides to work. So I went looking on Amazon and decided on these. Got the 5 pack and they all work great. Very happy with this purchase.
4.0 out of 5 stars;It workd;It's a lil snug on my Samsung phone.  It works for now
2.0 out of 5 stars;Didn't last 4 months, all have made it to the trash.;Enough said.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Phone has lost charge while I write this review. It's plugged in.;Product continuosly has trouble maintaining current. Using samsung S21+ Ultra.  Other cords  from different packs work great.  This brand however disconnects, and takes 12 hrs to charge my phone. Dont tell me it's my adapter box, i have 2 different samsung adapters, a 4 pack of off brand fast charger adapters, and a fast charging car adapter.  These cords have the same issue on EVERY adapter.  As I write this my phone has lost 2% while plugged into a samsung high speed adapter. Kinda sad. Will not be purchasing any other items from this seller.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Reviews Not Accurate: UPDATE (+1 Star);The seller has contacted me, offline, offering a refund in exchange for the deletion or update of my negative review below. (+1 star for reaching out.) They've let me know that a new manufacturer has been secured and the issues I outlined below have been addressed.I am not sure why I'm being contacted outside of my review after all this time, but a refund is not necessary. I would just like the product that I paid for.  I will make you a deal, seller. If you would kindly send one of the 'new' cables for me to test and review? At the end of 30 days, I will update this headline and review to reflect my experience with the new product.Not sure where all the positive reviews came from. The cables I received are not rated for fast charging regardless of the device being charged or charger. Further, the plastic covers on each end (Both small and large end) are loose (Were not heat-shrunk enough) and will not stay in place, making connecting both ends difficult.My kid's S9s and our S10s all threw errors when we connected using these cables, even after restarts and trying several different chargers. Tablets, android, iPad all same-same. You might have better luck but I cannot recommend these cables at any level. Too cheap to send back - just threw them away and ordered others.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging 😭;Not fast charging. Great price just not what I was looking for. I'll keep it because I'm too lazy to send it back.
2.0 out of 5 stars;SLOW charging;They charge, but VERY SLOWLY.  Love the long cords.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good selection;I just received them, but I can say that they look quality and resistant.  I especially like the flexibility of the ends.Recién los recibo,  pero puedo decir que lucen de calidad y resistentes.  Especialmente  me gusta la flexibilidad  de los extremos
2.0 out of 5 stars;Quit working properly;These worked well for about a month and a half. Then 2 out of the 5 stopped working. 2 more were okay for about another couple months and then they didn't want to work properly and didn't charge half the time. I only have one left that is still pretty much functional.I shouldn't buy such cheap cords, but I didn't have a whole bunch I could spend and I expected them to last more than just a few months. Especially since there were 5
3.0 out of 5 stars;2 cables aren't fast charging and are very hard to insert.;3 cables are working/charging very well. However 2 cables are not fast charging and also are very hard to insert...not happy with those two cables.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging ... Slow;Slow charging NOT AS GOOD OR AS  FAST  as JSAUX cords that I have bought before.. I'M DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT
1.0 out of 5 stars;Don't bother buying garbage;Do not bother using this cords, it will not charge your phone unless you'd like to wait 11 hrs.  I'm blaming the box and the cords I bought.  Do not sell inferior products just for monetary gain, I've used these for less than 2 weeks and how else can I spell garbage?
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good for price;It was good Quality, and charges well. However the grey covering of the charger slides off and could cause you to damage it easier.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Went through 5 cords in less than a year;All 5 cords never left my wall charger but they all got some sort of short after about 2 months to where I am on my last pne and none of them fast charged...ever.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Does not charge our Samsung Tablets;Our Samsung tablets would slowly drain power or not charge at all with these. We have bought many other brands that work fine. Unfortunately we bought these as backup and when we finally had to use them it was too late to return.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Adapter got super hot with these cords attached;I would never buy again. We bought these for the hospital for when I gave birth because they say to bring long cords. It felt like the wall adapter thing was going to start on fire from being so hot. Even tried once we got home and same thing. Time got the best of me so i just threw away instead of returning.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good price and seem sturdy;My wife got a new phone which needed a different cable than her old phone. This multi pack seemed ideal as it allows cables for work, the car, the bedroom and living room so she always had one conviently located. They work well and seem to be well constructed. Hopefully they will last.
1.0 out of 5 stars;NOT ALL USB C CORDS ARE CREATED EQUAL!;"When you look at these cords compared to other cords on Amazon, you're thinking, ""yeah, what a great deal.  Let me buy a set.  All cords are the same right?  A cord is a cord is a cord"", so I thought.  I purchased a few of these cord sets.  I gave them to different family members to charge their Google Pixel devices.  Everything was working well until, at random, family members (who live in different residences) started reporting the same problem - the phone would stop working all together.  After researching online, Google engineer Benson Leung indicated that there are some USB C cords that can damage your device because they don't supply the correct voltage.  Unfortunately, I believe this is the case with these cords as well.  They ended up frying the devices so that they don't work at all.  It short circuits the device so that it's basically useless.  I had to replace a number of Google Pixel devices because of this.  I really wanted to enjoy these cords because they're braided and durable, but if it can't give the correct amount of current and damage the device, it's not worth it.  The voltage issue with USB C cords isn't common knowledge now, but I will work to inform my friends to get name brand cords and not to try to save money on the cords - it's not worth it.  Most people won't think about the cord damaging the device and think that it's the device that's faulty, but that's not always the case."
5.0 out of 5 stars;Short cable;I have several Samsung devices and my cable management for multiple length cables was a bother.  With these 1 foot cables every one of them are constant and I no longer have a mess of charging cables all over the table top.
3.0 out of 5 stars;3 good cords 2 unable to use did not fit disappointed;Only 3 of the cords fit 2 are unusable  very disappointed after paying for 5 therfore I could not give 5 stars
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good;Good product for its price. I have been using the charging cables for a few months, I like that the USB C is a bit longer as it creates a more snug fit! So far only one of the five wires stopped working. Charging is good too.
1.0 out of 5 stars;You don't want these;One of the cords does not work at all & the others all charge very slow. For instance my phone is on 10% battery & if i plug in one of these cords it says 7+hours until full. If i use my fire tablet charger it says about 2 hr 30 minutes until full.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Charger won't stay in any device. Easily slips out;For a quick fix sure. Long time probably not!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Very cool and high quality;Cool design, good durability, good price for the quality.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Sirven pero no son de la mejor calidad;Sirven pero no son de la mejor calidad
4.0 out of 5 stars;Very good cables.;Sturdy product, great packaging. Very happy i bought them.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Decent USB-C cable but not good braiding;The USB-C cables work well enough, but the braiding seems very cheap and just feels like very thin cloth, just waiting to shred. The cable are way too stiff, but for my use they will do. For all this these only deserve a 3 star rating, meaning they will work, but don't expect too much out of them.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Meets the standard.;I found it as described.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Fit tight and snug;Excellent chargers
1.0 out of 5 stars;Will not last.  Disposable.;These cords charge fine at first. They are fast. The length is as described.  They will not last however.  I tried to use them in my car, but I need a new one every month.  If you hit a bump or need to pick up your phone, you'll lose connectivity with your vehicle.  They might be better suited for a less used connection, but otherwise expect to run through them quickly. Additionally, quality varies between cords.
3.0 out of 5 stars;kinda cheapo;look i know its silly to complain about the braiding on one of the five of
2.0 out of 5 stars;No duraron mucho;La carga es buena y rapida,y lo largo es fantastico fue la razon que los compre, pero no las use ni mucho tiempo y ya 3 no funcionan como debe de ser, cada rato esta fallando y dice que carga y despues no esta cargando.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Half of them don't work, but the ones that do work are great;Half of them don't work, but the ones that do work are great
2.0 out of 5 stars;Data transfer is garbage;"These work fine for charging. They all have sporadic disconnections when using them for data transfer. Android Auto was impossible to use with these cables (I tried 3 out of 5 of them in two different cars). I eventually tried a less expensive ""generic"" cable and had no problems at all.If you only ever need these to charge an item, they're great. If you ever expect to have to use them for data, they're terrible."
1.0 out of 5 stars;Poor quality;These cords drain my batteries faster than they charge.  Quite disappointed in this product.  Would like to send them back for a refund.
3.0 out of 5 stars;As a whole good deal for a bundle of chargers however the chargers themselves aren't perfect;Not exactly fast charging but also it isn't stable or constantly charging if you move yr phone so while it works at charging your phone or device if you can afford a better one then look further
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works great;This cable works like it is supposed to.
1.0 out of 5 stars;A half foot short;All the six-foot cords measured a half foot short. I didn't bother to test them, because the seller didn't bother to measure them or sell honestly. I reurned them promptly.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Sturdy;Great value!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great price for the product!;Great price!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Did not last long;Did not last long
2.0 out of 5 stars;Arrived damaged;Save your money. 3 out of the 5 were badly damaged, was able to fix one of them. Other 2 even though I was able to get it to sit properly in the USB port after manipulating it, they won’t charge now.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Neither worked;They won't charge any device and I've tried power plugs that I know work. Waste of money.
4.0 out of 5 stars;It was ok;the charging power wasn't a fast charge like my previous power cord
3.0 out of 5 stars;Convenient but not durable;These are nice and long, which make them convenient, but it has only been a couple months since I received my order and, during that time I've used two of the cables. One stopped working within 1.5 months, and the second stopped working within 3 weeks. Hopefully I have better luck with the remaining cables, but as of right now, I would say that they are very convenient, but seem to have poor longevity and durability.
5.0 out of 5 stars;excelent cables;if you are looking for type C cable this are your cables.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Finally a fast charging cable;This has been a great Cable so far. I bought few to have in various places so don't forget to tote my cable around. Very fast charging!
5.0 out of 5 stars;USB cable;The USB cables are exactly what I wanted, extra long and rugidly built.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not very durable;In less than two months, one charger has stopped working. Overall I think the value is good, but don't be too rough with these.
1.0 out of 5 stars;KILLED MY PS5;Only had this item less than 48hrs and it destroyed my PS5. My PS5 caught on fire and the USB part of the cord is now black and my PS5 won’t turn on at all
5.0 out of 5 stars;Awesome price point;The best Samsung charging cords anywhere near this price point, especially for a 5 packs set. These cords are high speed, and have great quality feel to them(braided insulation). They are short, so I'd recommend looking at the seller's other longer cord packs, but for me these were perfect for areas where excess cord length gets in the way, like my desk at work, USB port on couch, and when plugged into the center console in my car. The value for the money can't be beat!
4.0 out of 5 stars;not bad;Extremely long cord which is awesome but the little tab already fell off. Which if it doesnt cause any problem with charging is fine with me. Like the quantity for the price and they do charge fast
1.0 out of 5 stars;These don't work for lostopped working after a week;This cord fast charges for about a week then switches to slow charge, then stops working all together.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Definitely. Recommended Bought another set as gift;Definitely. Recommended Bought another set as gift
4.0 out of 5 stars;noting;this is the type of charging length I was looking for.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Ah;It's a charger
4.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect for us;Love these do not bend and break easily. Especially having a son whose rough on everything. They charge without any problems or the cord getting kinked. And i can keep 1 in the car and each room without having to constantly move cords from room to room.  Very satisfied with this purchase.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not So Bad, Great Price;Its ok. I noticed without a charger block/cube, it charges very slow but charges very fast with one. My issue is I can't move my phone around while its charging or it will constantly connect/disconnect. Chargers usually don't do that until you've had it for a while.
4.0 out of 5 stars;These cables feel and look strong, but...;These cables feel and look strong, but until they are “teen tested” after Christmas, I will hold off on the 5-Star rating.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Muy buen producto;Excelente material
5.0 out of 5 stars;These cords work;This is a great value to get so many cords for such a low price. The braided cord feels sturdy and durable. I like the shorter length of these as it doesn't contribute too much to wire clutter. I feel this is a good purchase as products are switching from micro USB to USB-C but still have all of their old USB power blocks and computer ports. Previously I had one cord that I had to juggle between my home charger, work charger, car charger, and computer connection, now I can have one cord in each location.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Multi function chargers;I ordered the 5 pack and they worked for a few days then they stopped charging.  Very disappointed.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Just got it.;Just got it.  Seems sturdy.  Hopefully in 6 months I will be able to say the same.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Product fail;2 of 5 so far have failed within a week of usingI'll be returning
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not very durable;The covers on the ends of the cord have fallen off of every cord in the pack.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Well made;It's built well, very durable.  No splitting or fraying.  The length is great to use in bed or even plug in the front outlet in a car and use in the back seat.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good Product;Worked as advertised with a good price and prompt shipping
1.0 out of 5 stars;VERY STURDY;Cords length was great, connecting points seem to be better So far doesn't seem to be loosing tight connection from daily use plugging n unplugging as many Cords Quickly Become loose and DOes NOT stay in!Only problem is no Flexibility where Cords n connection attatch Too stiff sticking straight out so must have a flat surface or tall stand when charging and if connected while using device must hold out away from bodySTIFFNESS is a Big hindrance After time a bending it starts to cause power not to continuously flow at least  in All 5 of my cables I GotI don't leave house often so disconnecting is very limited 2 times a day max but The reduced flow of power causes my plugged in devices to die NOT Truelly charging unless left alone and even then Reduce Charges by over 75% on 3 devices of 5 cords thats an average
2.0 out of 5 stars;They're Not Fast Charging;If you're searching for fast charging cords, please seek another brand. They do charge but not quickly.
2.0 out of 5 stars;I do not recommend;Got this have one away then used one. First one lasted 3 days. Ok waited a while then used another lasted 8 hours. I plugs my phone in it and charged then my brother hooks up to it and it charges. Well I go to use it again and phone would say it's not right anymore. It wouldn't fast charge nor regular charge. Only would slow charge after. Have 2 left and not even going to use. Them even the one I gave away lasted 2 days
4.0 out of 5 stars;Quality;The product is a good quality
2.0 out of 5 stars;Won't stay in my phone;The USB c connections n slowly comes out over time and will fall out of my phones. My older cords don't have this issue
3.0 out of 5 stars;Quickly need to replace these;I thought they seemed durable and I appreciate the value, but if found that they quickly need to be replaced, so I've gone through a package of 5 in the amount of time I'd expect one or two to still last.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Okay 👌;Okay 👌
1.0 out of 5 stars;Cord will NOT connect / charge.  Three cords work of five.;Confused ordered five but two cables do not work.  Did not know until needing them a few months later.  Why?  Will not charge or connect.  Why?Three cords work of five.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Bad durability;Purchased this on February 17th. It's been barely two months, and this is already happening. I haven't been pulling the cord or anything--I've been gentle with it, and yet the inside of the cable keeps getting exposed a bit more every day. It charges fast, but for safety reasons, I would look somewhere else.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charging;"I have used 2 of the cables from the 5-pack so far. I'll probably throw away the other 3.  Both of the ones will only ""slow charge"" our devices, and both of them appear to be wired wrong, since the usb-c end only worked when it was oriented in one specific way.  I couldn't plug it either way -- only one way would allow a charge or data connection, and then it was only a slow charge."
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great quality cords for less;The quality on this is surprisingly good when you consider the price. I would pick this over all over options.
1.0 out of 5 stars;NOT AS ADVERTISED;Bought a 5 pack of green cables. Instead of a package of 5 cables with green connectors, I received a bag of spaghetti cables. It was literally a bag with tangled cables inside. 3 purple, 1 black. I didn't even get 5 and on top of that 2 straight up didn't work, 1 overheated my Samsung 5g note ultra. Additionally, all the cables had these springs wrapped around them, but some were bent/stretched and this forced the connector to be at an angle to the cable. 1 of the cable's sheathing was frayed at the butt of the connector. Can't recommend.
3.0 out of 5 stars;They are ok;Have not used one yet they look heavy duty and will do the job
2.0 out of 5 stars;Good while it lasts;The chargers work great for about 2 or so months, then the time to charge slowly get longer and longer till it takes 8 hours to charge your phone and it only works if you plug it in a certain way.
1.0 out of 5 stars;So called 5 pack contained only 1 cable and it was broken;"Only 1 cable was present and it had been folded so the insides were protruding from the braiding. So much for Warehouse deals supposedly ""checked"""
4.0 out of 5 stars;very durable;These charging cables are heavier and sturdier than most.  The only negative thing I can say about them is the fact that the length isn't long enough.  3ft is just not long enough, but it isn't a dealbreaker.  These cables will last quite a while!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Ruined my phone's charging port -_-;Blame the cable, or blame the phone, or blame the user.... End result, my phone won't charge after attemptimg to use one of these cables.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Speed of charging;These are a WASTE OF MONEY....look real nice but SUPPPPEEEERRRSLOW CHARGE!!!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great buy!;Love it other than the sturdiness could be a bit better but for its price it worked great!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works;Nice cord, rather stiff
2.0 out of 5 stars;Losing charge while phone is plugged in;Product worked great.... For about a week. Now it keeps disconnecting over and over. I made sure to check that the connection is secure to the outlet, then to the power adapter, and to my phone. it's just the cable itself. I've never seen such a short life for a charging cable.The length is great. It feels durable, but none of that matters if the cable doesn't work. Thankfully you get 5 in a pack, so hopefully at least one or two last more than a week.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Do not fit;It would not charge my phone.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great value.;These cords are a great value. Very durable and the cord length was great.  Would definitely order again.
1.0 out of 5 stars;These cables fall out so easily;I have a Galaxy s10. If I put the cable in a certain way it goes from 1 hour charging time to 6-8 hours of charging time. I've woken up to my phone barely charged. I was looking to replace the cable that came with my fast charger, and I got this bulk (and yes it's durable) cable that is unsatisfying. It's not about the size of the cable it's about how you use it and I can't use it 50% of time.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Fine until it's not;I ordered 6ft but only got 3ft. So that's annoying. Each one these cords stopped working just outside the return window. They worked just fine for about 6-8weeks and now they don't charge. My phone's and devices show that they are charging but the percentage does not increase. Change out the cord and bam they start increasing charge.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Fake nylon braded - way to ridgid;"The media could not be loaded.
                



 People are leaving reviews on here on how this cable can handle a lot of amperage. If you know anything about how electrical components work with one another then that's irrelevant as your phone & other devices can only handle so much power anyways. The whole point of having a nylon braided cable is for it to be flexible and not ruin the charging port of your phone over time like a rigid cable does. This cable is more rigid than even the old school thick USB cables. If you're looking for something that's flexible this is nowhere near that. You can feel the cheap material in your hand and the see the poor build quality when you hold it in your hand. So I also added a video so you can see for yourself, hope it helps."
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works as expected.;Nice sturdy cord that charges as expected. Was exactly what I needed.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Buen producto;Buenproducto.con el tiempo se despega el emchufle.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Useless for charging Google Pixel 3;I figured cable technology was simple enough that affordable options would be satisfactory, and was initially very pleased with the price, appearance, sturdiness of these cables... But that soon changed when I began using them. I understood they're not fast-charging cables but expected a lot better. When plugged in the wall, it charges my Google Pixel 3 about 5% per hour -- compared to >50% from the original Google cable. If I try to still use the phone while plugged in, including for low-power apps like email, the % at best stays the same but usually continues to drop. I've also used this cable to charge via my computer and car outlet, and it completely fails to charge -- it doesn't keep up with the battery loss from sitting idle! Other reviews and Q&A said it works for Pixel, and any type C USB, but the performance must wildly vary.As such, I don't touch any of the 5 cables, they're good looking but useless. Don't buy these.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good Cable Good Price;No complaints about the cables. Not expensive and appear to be a good quality. I've been using them for a little while now and have had no problems. The seller sent out the cables the same day that I ordered them. TY
4.0 out of 5 stars;Super Charge;Great charge and sturdiness, but not sure about the durability have not had them long enough to totally confirm.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great C style charges;Seems to be well built and charges fast based on the charging block used.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good;So far so good
5.0 out of 5 stars;For the price I can't complain.;So far so good.
1.0 out of 5 stars;None of the cables charge my phone;These are pretty bad and unreliable. They charged my phone for a day or two then stopped working. All of them. I do not recommend you buy these.  This is the old saying you get what you pay for!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Worst cable charger EVER;Charging power is pretty much nonexistent.  I plugged it in at 12 midnight, with 78%  power.  When I woke up 8 hours later the battery showed 33% power.  Because I had thrown out all of the packaging, I'm stuck with it, so now it's going in the trash.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Okay for the price;Does not rapidly charge
5.0 out of 5 stars;I will purchase again!;I have purchased this product before , I have no regrets.... they have my business!
3.0 out of 5 stars;These work fine in most cases;"These work fine in most cases, but if you have a device with a USB-C port that is sometimes picky about making perfect contact, these are not recommended. I have purchased a few different brands of cords for charging tablets and phones, and these are my least favorite. My Samsung S8 is very particular about how it's plugged in to charge, and I have to try several times and push VERY firmly upon plugging it in for the phone to register that it is a ""fast charger"" connected.  If I don't do it exactly right, it will charge at a much slower rate, probably 1.0 amp speed. This is not an issue with the Samsung and Rankie cords I own.That said, my other devices like these cords just fine for now. I always enjoy having the tough braided cords."
1.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charge;Got these because of the ratings and it said fast charge but they are JUNK! If you consider 3 hours a fast charge then they're for you. Used with a fast charge wall adapter or just a USB power source and still no difference! Tried 2 different cell phones and a tablet and was slow for all 3! Spend the extra $ and get something better.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Never buy this cord;The description says that it is fast charging that is why I purchased them but it is not fast charging at all.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Charger permanently failed first time hooked up to three units;Charger junk after hookup to three units
3.0 out of 5 stars;Horrible durability with great charge. Disappointing.;I've had these cords for a few weeks now and already the cord doesn't charge in one direction. I have to input the charger a certain way in order for it to charge properly. When it is charging though, its very effective.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good product;Works fine
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great value;Would definitely recommend.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging;iPad will die if using it on this charger
5.0 out of 5 stars;🥳;Works Great!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Bad charging;It doesnt charge my phone effectively i was wondering why my phone loses charge and i went back to an old cord an it works way better good stand in but if i woulda knew sooner id ask for a refund
2.0 out of 5 stars;Most of these have fallen apart;Half of my cords had the top popping off and had issues charging after a few months of use
3.0 out of 5 stars;Didn't wear very well;Doesn't work for extended period of time,  works well at first, then dosen't stay plugged in!
3.0 out of 5 stars;not durable;works great at first but after a week of using I have to hold the cord at just the right angle for the cord to charge my phone, thought it was a fluke but 3 of the cords have done the same
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great value, good quality;Only had them for a week but seems like they are high quality durable cords
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good charge;Product amserms to be a sturdy construction and has charged quickly.
3.0 out of 5 stars;One of the cords did not work;One of the cords did not work
4.0 out of 5 stars;Type C charging cables.;Son needed extra charging cables for his Note 10 and h=these work great.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Great at first but don't last long.;The length is great for these cords but they lost any charging capability after the 2 months in use. I have tried different plugs and directly into a USB outlet with no luck. Not worth the money to only work for such a short period of time.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Thick and sturdy;These cables are thick and sturdy, but do not seem to charge my phone as fast as my old charger cables - - but also different type of phone and maybe thicker charges slower? Not sure, but they will suffice.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Too long to fit galaxy note 9. Had to file metal to fit;Filled usb c side so the electric contacts connected within the phones port. Worked great after 2 minutes with a file.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Junk;Does not stay charging, too loose for the port, stops whenever it feels like it... Over all.. Junk.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Sturdy and durable USB-C cables!;"I had to buy some new USB-C charging cables, in bulk, because my friends ""borrow"" them and I never see them again. These cables are the perfect length and I do like the durable rope-like cord a lot...seems like they'll last a long while. I have them all over now, at work, at home, in my car, in my bag... just so I know my phone will always be charged no matter where I am. Hopefully I don't need to buy more but would definitely buy these again if I have to!"
4.0 out of 5 stars;Pretty good, just not very fast;My only issue with these are that they don't charge very fast. Useful as spares for guests or overnight but not when in a rush
4.0 out of 5 stars;USB-2 Speed for Data, but fine for charging;These work great as basic USB-C charging cables and can be used in a pinch as a data cable - but remember it's running at USB-2 speeds only.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Looks good, fits baaaaaaad;Few more times and i believe this would have damaged my new phone. Fit horribly to the new devices. Returned..
2.0 out of 5 stars;Works fine for power but not data;If you just want a long charging cord, these work great.  If you want a long cable for connecting to a PC or radio for Android Auto as in my case, then keep looking elsewhere.  These seem to charge fine, but all 5 failed to serve as a connection to android auto in any of my vehicles while other long and short cables work just fine.
4.0 out of 5 stars;As spec'd;does what its supposta
4.0 out of 5 stars;Woking great;Working great. standard length. Good quality, way better than rubber/plastic charging cables.Now no one has to fight over chargers...we all get one. Extremely fast shipping
3.0 out of 5 stars;Minor cosmetic issue: The metal piece  that covers the plug fell off after a few days.;The metal cover that is wrapped around the USB-C connector, fell off.  I could probably glue it back on.  The cable still works fine, it's just not as pretty as it was.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not capable of quick charging;These are nicely made cables and I like the flexibility they have but there is one major issue. They cannot fast charge your device. These are only good for data transfer and slow charge. I was a but surprised by this considering the thickness of the cables.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Seems like a good deal but a month later and one or two work;Seems like a great deal, but these are extremely delicate. One didn't even work straight out of the pack.
3.0 out of 5 stars;"Not ""Fast Charging""";Plugged in and it said charge time FOUR hours.  Unplugged and plugged old charger in and it said charge time 1.5 hours.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Worst cables ever.;"BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK! One of the cords came unable to charge because the ""cap"" on the end that goes over the USB C end was too long and covering most of the USB C. So when you plug it into your phone, it just falls out. The other 4 cords were okay. (You can kind of tell from the picture. Left is an okay one. Right is the bad one that immediately falls out)After about 2 weeks of using these, my husband's phone completely died. We took it to a repair shop and they determined it wasn't the battery or the charging port. They said if you buy cheap, bad charging cables, they can cause this. We had our phones (old now cause we were forced to buy new ones) for 3 years with no problem. Once we started using these chargers, problem. I would not buy again. I've meant to return them but with every going on in the world, it wasn't a priority and now I'm past my return window by 4 days.. I will just throw them out. Buying Anker cords like I should have in the first place."
2.0 out of 5 stars;some seemed okay, poor quality control - 1 did not work immediately, second stopped working;first time i regretted buying cheap cables. quality problems... .2 seem to support fast charging. i cable did not work at all out of the package. second stopped working within 2 months. too late for return window. planning to replace. Did not damage my devices though, so that's good or lucky, i guess.
3.0 out of 5 stars;May not last long.;Usb 3 plug moves backwards in the plastic housing. Couldn't figure out why it kept coming out of device being charged will only a little movement until I noticed the metal end seemed shoter. Cables is sturdy but plugs are not firmly fixed to it.
5.0 out of 5 stars;High quality at a good price;The cables were delivered quickly, before the promised date.  These work great for expanding the charging options for my electronics.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't work AT ALL with car adapters!!  Useless in car...does not charge at all!;"Seems heavy duty, but must play with the connection to get to ""Fast Charging"", otherwise, just normal charging.  Except, they do not work at all with a car adapter...does not charge at all, which is why only 2 stars!  My advice, go with another supplier."
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great cables;Ok cables. Do the job.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Didn't last long.;Worked perfectly for a month or so then after about two months they all stopped working.
4.0 out of 5 stars;NICE SET OF CORDS;THESE WERE VERY WELL CONSTRUCTED. AS I ALWAYS BEND THEM, THESE COULD HANDLE IIT WITHOUT SPLITTING. WOULD BUY AGAIN
2.0 out of 5 stars;Slowest cords I've ever used;"Bought the cords based on positive reviews, but these cords are horrible at doing the one thing they are meant to do which is charge the phone. The company claims fast charging, and they might actually charge fast on a quick charging brick. The problem is on every other charger whether its plugged into a car, computer, or ""standard"" charging brick, it charges so slowly you might as well not even have it plugged in.At least with other cords and a ""standard"" charging brick, the phone would actually charge. These cords are essentially worthless. Wish I could return them."
5.0 out of 5 stars;Fits well and charges fast;Works well! I was worried if the casing around the plug would be to wide. I have experienced plugs that would not work because they did not fit with the case. I am happy to say these are thin enough for probably any case and they fast charge.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good value!;Long enough to allow your children to play with their tablets in the back seat of the van. Become ineffective sooner than I would like due to same children bending frequently. Still, I recommend.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Highly recommended;I bought other months before but I love the quality and if a speed of these.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Push until it Clicks!!;I use this on my 2019 IPAD Pro the cord works great but you have to push it until it clicks and locks into the iPad or it won’t charge properly. Compared to the apple USB C cord it’s much thicker. This cord allows me to use my older iPhone wall usb chargers, usb surge protector outlets and usb wall outlets. Great Value with the multi pack!!
5.0 out of 5 stars;works well;as what I expected
4.0 out of 5 stars;Usbc  cable;Pretty good quality plus u can't beat the price.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Prompt delivery.;The cables were delivered as scheduled. They are a gag gift for a friend, so I don't know how well they work. The cables look to be better built than cheaper cables out there. I would buy from this company again.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good;Charging my phone
3.0 out of 5 stars;Don't work;They stop working after a week or so not all of them worked but I was already out of time to complain about it.  Will not purchase these cards again.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Does not fast charge;"I give these cables 2 stars because they are advertised as fast charging and they do not. I am using an OEM Samsung 25w charger on a Zfold 3. The phone just says ""charging"" and shows a 20 minute difference charging from 50% to full charge using these cables vs OEM.They appear to be good quality, at least at face value, just received them. I would give them 5 stars if they were advertised properly and I wasn't looking to fast charge."
3.0 out of 5 stars;My view after 1 year of use;I really like the construction of the cable and felt pretty sturdy. After about 8 months of use, however, there is a failure with all of the cables. Its possible that after inserting and removing the cable, the contact are no longer stable.My tablet and phone, regardless if I am using the Samsung fast charger or any USB charging (even my laptop), the device states that it detects a slow charging. Replaced the cable in the past 12 months, works for a couple of months with no issue and then the issue restarts.I also noticed that the device connects and disconnects numerous times if you move the cable just slightly.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Super slow.;Took all night to charge my phone.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Average;About average
3.0 out of 5 stars;Difficulty in keeping pluged in.;Very hard to keep them plugged into the phone.  Bought others from another vendor and have no problems.  They do a good job if you could keep them plugged.
2.0 out of 5 stars;USB-C side is loose, unusable!!;The cables are well made but are unusable.  I must of gotten a bad batch of these cables, the usb-c side of the cable has a very loose connection in anything I tried.  All five of the cables have the same issue.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not worth the money;Very disappointed, bought these in December 2021 and now on my last cord.  These worked good at first, but they would end up shorting out.  Only used them at night to charge phone.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Tight fit;Stiff cords. Tight fit
1.0 out of 5 stars;Poor Quality;Beware- these chargers are very slow... 1-5% per hour... I'd recommend finding another product.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Disappointed;Bought this brand a few times in the past with no problem, but this pack, it seems all 5 cables don't work on any phone in our house. ??????
3.0 out of 5 stars;Cheap, make sure you check every cable before using.;I ordered these cables because they were inexpensive and good enough to have as spares around the home and the office.  They arrived quickly and seemed alright at first, but the quality is not very good.The USB-C connector on at least one of them has one metal pin out of place and sticking out, which seems like it could damage my devices.You do get 5 for $10 (which is very cheap), but be prepared to toss one or two away as they aren't of the best quality.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works ok;No problem so far.  Was surprised on packaging.  Bit over the top for just usb cables.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Fine, but not the cords I ordered;I ordered 5 3ft cables and got 2 6ft cables instead. I did not want 6ft cables because they're way too long, but they work and I don't really care enough to return them. Oh, well.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not Fast Charger;The description is misleading. These are not fast Charger cables hence taking 2 stars away. I gave it a 3 stars because the length was on point.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good price for quantity;Package arrived when expected. Chargjng has been great thus far. Not super fast, but not slow either. Charging speeding is decent. Good price for 5 cables. Would purchase again.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great price and quality;Great longer cable for charging phone, tablets or anything with a USB C connection.  Very good quality and feels very durable.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't last very long!;"In my experience, these lines ""fast charge"" for a few weeks and then perform intermittently.  The price makes it worthwhile."
5.0 out of 5 stars;5 STARS;5X 6 foot charging cables that you can connect to Android auto for  9.99
4.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charging for Samsung Galaxy s10e;Sturdy and durable cords. Only issue is the slow charging for my Samsung Galaxy s10e.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Short life span;These cords come in a pack of 5. I bought them in Dec. It's now April, & I'm using the last one. Each one worked fine in the beginning, but quickly decreased in charging speed until they hardly charged at all. I frequently got a msg from my phone that it was charging slowly and to use my device's original cord. I liked the fact these cords were 6 ft long & appear on the outside to be durable, but their life span is very short. Obviously, I do not recommend this product.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Absolute trash;These have the effectiveness of an old cable that's starting to fray, where you have to wiggle and adjust it til it gets to the perfect angle, and only then will it charge. and they charge very slowly. Extremely frustrating.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Work as expected.;Ten feet is surprisingly long.
2.0 out of 5 stars;This product suck;This product sort of sucks. When I tried to use it with my fast charging adapter, it has to be at a specific angle for it to fast charge my phone. If not, it will charge normally and/or most always will not charge at all. When its in a specific angle and I get to have the fast charge sign, its not fast charging at all (with the slightest move, i will loose the charging ability). It took about 3-5 minutes for it to get 1% - if I'm lucky its 2-3 minutes for 1% (my old cables will charge faster than this). I don't think I will reorder this. I took the risk and change the brand of the cables I used to use, and I'm sort of regret it.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Mediocre for Android Auto;They seem to be well constructed cords. However, it took me several attempts to get it to work with my car's Android Auto system which is the only reason why I bought them. Seems like they're not designed too well for that purpose
3.0 out of 5 stars;They don't last long;I've had these cables for less than a year.  bought 5 so I could have one in my office, one in my car and one in my wife's car ( I didn't want to have to transfer /move them all the time, plus I thought they would last longer if I didn't move them).I've been stranded now 2 times with a dead battery because I couldn't get a charge through one of these cables.  Now i'm down to 2 that work but I can't trust them so I'm looking for a different brand.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Bought in January;Bought these in January and some of them already don't work. Some do still. Super annoying they didn't make it a year min.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Does not charge iPad Air 2022;"It does not charge freshly bought iPad Air 2022 at all. Neither quickly nor slowly. When plugged into iPad, instead of charging, it says: ""Unlock the iPad to use this accessory"". And, even after unlocking, nothing happens. Other cables I have don't do that.All in all, it goes back to Amazon"
5.0 out of 5 stars;I never know which kind I need...So I just buy a few of each.;These aren't the right plugs for my phone.  I hate these tiny little plugs!  Not you fault.  They fit my buddy Dave's phone.  He likes them a lot!
2.0 out of 5 stars;bargain charging cords, limited life;these cords look and feel high quality, and they worked for me, except for one whose plug cover separated from the plug on the 2nd week of use, then partial functioning.  Not sure how the others will fare, but based on this limited data, and no clear means to contact seller for correction, I do not recommend.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great price but not very good charging power;They're very well built but they dont charge very fast. Great for the value though,  and for use in the car or if someone needs to borrow a cord.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great value for price! Speedy shipping!!;They work really great! And I have enough for every area of the house I need done for, plus some extras. Speedy delivery and great quality for the price. Will buy again!!
4.0 out of 5 stars;That's it's pretty good;Pretty rugged
1.0 out of 5 stars;Worthless. Slow charging;The three ive tried so far are absolute garbage. They are trash. Don't waste your moneyEdit: I have tried all of the chargers and they are all slow charging. 6+ hours to full battery.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good buy!;These charging cables are perfect.  They are very sturdy and well made and the cable us thick.  They work really well, too!  I also like the length.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Not 6ft long as advertised;It definitely is not 6ft. long
2.0 out of 5 stars;Waste of money;I bought these, thinking i was getting a great deal, to tell replace a good that would lose connection when I moved my device. First one of these out of the package did the save thing. But the bullet and bought a name brand cord and it functions perfectly with no issues.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Data transfer;Good
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great Cables and Value;Great value for what you get. Snug connections on both ends and adjustable USB end gives it features that most other cables don't have. Great value that you get a decent amount of cables for the cost of two brand name cables.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Usable but not very durable;It did not break down on me but the USB-A end becomes a bit loose. It is usable only if you don't move around a lot.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Disappointing;I am not sure they sent me the correct cords with the WHITE ends...  the phone did not charge well and maybe charged 5% after sitting connected for an hour.  I used one of my other cords (both had black tips) and it charged 50% in about an hour.  TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT
2.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped Working with Android Auto App;Worked well for a few months. Then Android Auto would not connect my phone to my car using the cable and it suggested I try a different cable.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Working fine;I feel like I can never have enough charging cables and now that we all have to have the C version in my house, I bought this pack. I've only used a couple of the cords but they worked fine  so far.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Charges fast;Came quick. Works good. Charges fast.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Seem to be good quality.;Good price.  Good service.
1.0 out of 5 stars;DO NOT BUY;DO NOT BUY, these BRICKED MY HUSBAND'S PHONE. Husband started using these before me and noticed it was getting more and more difficult to charge his phone. The chargers stop working quickly and short out, but we didn't make the connection. We just blamed the phone itself and started saving for a new one, continuing to use these until the phone would not charge at all. Phone is now completely useless and will not charge or turn on. Recently started using the chargers for my phone as well, as my old charger finally broke, and quickly noticed my phone developed the same difficulty charging. It kept getting worse until I switched to a different brand. Again NOT SAFE, NOT GOOD FOR YOUR PHONE, DO NOT BUY
2.0 out of 5 stars;Don't Last Long;These cables come loose way sooner than most.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Connectors Off-size;The connectors are off-size so the are pulling the from my iPad, Google phone, and all the charging blocks takes some effort. The impedance might be too high as all my devices charge more slowly with these cables. It was easier to donate the to Goodwill than to return them.
4.0 out of 5 stars;50/50 fastcharge;It sometimes fast charges and other times it doesn't but hey 5 cables for $10 is a good deal.
4.0 out of 5 stars;long cord;Love the length, it seems like good quality so far
2.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't allow super fast charging.;Purchased for use on a note 10+5g and note 20 5g ultra. They do fast charging but won't do super fast charge. 45watt  tried them on 2 different chargers and confirmed the usb cables are to blame.  My phone is at 50% and it says there is 50 minutes remaining to full charge. (Fast charging)NOT A SUPER FAST CHARGING CABLE!!!!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great lengths.;"I use it for my new 10"" kindle that came with a 3 ft. Charging cable."
5.0 out of 5 stars;Very pleased with the purchase. Works with Samsung S9 for a fast charge.;We've used these for about a month and they work great. They also work with my Samsung Galaxy S9+ for the fast charging.Unlike other cords that we have purchased, these cords are much thicker and seem to be more durable. Overall, I am very pleased with the purchase.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charge;Durable. Slow charge
1.0 out of 5 stars;These cables are worthless;After about 100 charges they just stop working. No visible damage on exterior.My phone charges with a different cable, so it has to be these cables just stop working for some reason.Don't buy.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great cords;They are sturdy. I like the they are wrapped. I've never had one fray or start to fall apart. They charge well. Super happy with these cords.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Junk! Do not buy!;"At first they would fast charge, but I had to keep plugging them back in repeatedly to get them to do so. Now I am barely getting slow charging (went from 8 hours to now 38 hours) and a lot of charging error warnings on my phone! Only had these a few weeks and am here, looking for better cables.... ""Amazon Favorite"" is listed on these, so I felt compelled to write this review."
3.0 out of 5 stars;Charge great but super thin!;very thin line that looks like it can snap if you simple pull from your phone.....  --------  --------(=
5.0 out of 5 stars;Sturdy cables;Nice cables nice and sturdy.
4.0 out of 5 stars;good quality;so far , so good
3.0 out of 5 stars;Charges well/not durable;Product was delivered on December 28th. Noticed the chord is frayed today (January 25th). Less than a month. Used daily however not in a high traffic area. Charging power is great.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Don't buy this one!;Takes forever to charge.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charging;Charges very slow compared to Samsung oem or a few other brands, with the same socket
1.0 out of 5 stars;A bunch just don’t work;Constantly stops charging my phone and is a slow charge when it does. My cable of last resort
2.0 out of 5 stars;dont buy;all of the cords I got almost double my usual charging time. If I reposition the cord it helped speed it up slightly but not by much. Would not recommend
3.0 out of 5 stars;Nice cords but slow charge;The cords are durable and quality material but they charge all our devices much slower than the charging cables devices came with.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great Deal;a quality product for a good price
2.0 out of 5 stars;Charging is too slow I checked all cables.;I connected the cables to multiple base and the results are same.
3.0 out of 5 stars;6 months later, who knows!;Requesting a review on first impressions is ridiculous. Looks can be receiving.How do you review longevity or durability on an item thats less than a week old. Does it work to actual specks, don't have the equipment to test it.Arrived in two days. Item looks great. Worked ok the couple of times I used it.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Cable de tela algo rígido;El cable parece de buena calidad, pero al ser de tela no es muy flexible.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great!;I really like these cords. I needed backup cords for my iPad and MacBook since I loose them like people loose keys!! These cord worked great with both devises. Definitely will buy more as soon as a loose these ones lol!!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Garbagge;Garbagge
5.0 out of 5 stars;Fast charging;Really nice design fast changing love it I will definitely will buy another one
5.0 out of 5 stars;Amazing;Great product with best price. Fast charging works perfect. If one cable will go 6 months without any issue I will buy more packs.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Usefulness;Very hard to attach to the phone. Probable is too big plug to put into the phone
1.0 out of 5 stars;USB a end fell apart on each cable, junk;They charged great but each cable broke with limited use. The USB a end pulls apart from itself easily and then stops working. Buy a different brand.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good cords but, not fast charging.;They came in good packaging. They are good cords. They are very sturdy and durable but, are not fast charging cords like the claim.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Garbage Straight Out of Package;Brand new cords don't work, went through the whole pack in 3 months. Don't waste your money.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Fast chargers;Perfect chargers with long wire. My original broke and it has onky been two months thats why I bought a five pack this time. And the price is great for this deal, also they charge fast.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not very durable. Did not last.;Cord length good, but a cord does not last long.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great charging cords;Great charging cords. Significantly better quality than chords I've bought previously. They feel much more substantial.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Junk, not supported;They won’t charge my devices because it says it’s not a supported charger!!  Do not buy.  Took 3 hours to get 17% charge.  I didn’t realize until it was too late to return. Junk!!
3.0 out of 5 stars;So so...;These cable do the job but I wouldn't buy them again.  They are very stiff and don't stay in the phone.  If you pick your phone up to look at it you have to double check to make sure it is still in and charging as they come out very easy.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Solid wires, not cable;I had ordered some other USB-A to C cables previously, they were great. When I went to order more, they showed up as lightning cables only.These are stiff, solid-wire cables, and I expect to break quickly. They are not what you want for cables for charging your phone, but only for permanent connections.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good quality, wish it charged faster;I purchased the cables because it came in a 5-pack and had a great rating. After using the cables for about a week, I wish they would charge the phone faster, though.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Cheap junk;As the title says.  They are cheap and perform that way.  Tried to use them for use with Android Auto and all of them (yes, all) caused problems with Android Auto.  I pulled the cable out of my other vehicle that I thought I had paid too much for from AT&T store and Android Auto works flawlessly with that cable.  Total waste of money.
1.0 out of 5 stars;NOT WORTH IT;The 5 pk didn't last very long. Maybe a month before realizing all the cords were the problem. They took too long to charge.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Good... At first;I used these for the past few months and 3 of them have already stopped working. The cords are not damaged and I don't know why they suddenly became defunct. The charging power was average.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Durable, but a little stiff;The cord is a little too stiff, so it is sometimes hard to keep my phone where I want (it just slides back where the cord wants).
4.0 out of 5 stars;Exactly what I paid for.;So far they work great!!!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Ok for a quick fix;The quality wasnt as great as previous charging wires that I've ordered. They just dont last very long.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Fit as expected;Charging is ok, but construction isn't the best,  one of the three is coming apart at the  phone end.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Not bad for the price;It is a little difficult when inserting the charger to the phone, it sticks a bit.  Otherwise no complaints so far.
5.0 out of 5 stars;WORKS GREAT;Well made. Shipped FAST. Works great with my Samsung S9+
5.0 out of 5 stars;Durable;Great chargers. I tend to go through chargers like crazy because I often to the big no no of using my phone while plugged in. I have been using these for several months now and I am still using the first. It has lasted longer than any other charger I have had.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great value;They usually sell these types of cords for about $10 or more in the stores. Here you get 5. And they're all well made.  If you have a phone with a c type usb do yourself a favor and pick one of these up now and never have to worry about being without a charger cord.
1.0 out of 5 stars;AWFUL EXPERIENCE;"I received these chargers that were marketed as ""fast charging"" and they took 4 hours to charge my Galaxy S21. It is a complete lie. Then when I tried to make a return, the company decided to only refund me half of what I paid. I don't know how they're allowed to continue selling these when it's a complete lie and scam."
5.0 out of 5 stars;work great fast charge;wish they where a couple inches longer.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Does not fast charge;Charges fine but not a fast charge as advertised. I've tried several fast charging blocks and none of them have made the cords fast charge like I was wanting. The cord itself is sturdy and works well so far. I've used for about 2 weeks
5.0 out of 5 stars;👍;Sturdy and great for fast charging.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good cables;Not much to say, they work, good price.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great product for the money;Good quality, quick charging
5.0 out of 5 stars;Excelente producto;Excelente producto su material es excelente y se ajusta bien para los Xiaomi y para los Samsung que vienen con el puerto tipo C realmente lo recomiendo.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't hold up well to daily use;I bought these to plug my phone into the car for Android Auto. Initially worked great but after a few months of use I noticed that the phone started to lose connection with the car any time the cable would shift (and got progressively worse with time.) Eventually the housing for the USB C connector began to separate as well. I swapped for another cable from the pack which started great but also suffered the same fate. Don't recommend.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great value works great .;I use these for charging our galaxy phones, works great.  Have couple in my car and the rest for the house.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great cables for cost.;Work great. Quick charging works on HTC and Apple phones that I have. Cables feel durable, no problems.
4.0 out of 5 stars;It works.;It works.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Muy debil.;Funcional pero son bastante débiles. Tienden a cortarse del forro aunque sigue cargando.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Pass;While sturdy, these cables are trash. They charge my son's Nintendo Switch, but almost nothing else. 2 thumbs down 👎
3.0 out of 5 stars;No muy bueno;En una semana me dejó de cargar un cable
5.0 out of 5 stars;Much thicker than other cables;So far I am very impressed with the thickness and quality of the cable build.  Using it to charge my LG phone, handles quick charging no problem.  Hope these last
2.0 out of 5 stars;Seems durable, but doesn't act as a fast charger even with my oem power brick.;Cord is plenty long, feels like it'll hold up well, but the charging is significantly slower than oem cable.
5.0 out of 5 stars;As described;Good value
5.0 out of 5 stars;So far so good;It's only been a few days of using these, but so far they work and seem to be very heavy duty
3.0 out of 5 stars;Nice cables but now a failure;These are nicely constructed cables and all of them worked with my new phone.  I buy several so I can leave one plugged into my surfing PC, one in the car for charging and one in my travel back pack.  I have reduced my star rating to 3 after one of them just failed.  It's only use was in the house to charge my phone once every evening - so it didn't even last 1,000 times.
1.0 out of 5 stars;FIRE HAZARD! do not buy.;"05/01/20. I've had these a few months now and already three of them have gone from ""fast charging"" capable to ""slow charging"" to almost no charging at all with my Moto X4 phone. They seem well made but after using them for a bit it's obvious they wear out very fast. Would not recommend.06/06/20. One of these cables nearly lit my bed on fire. I plugged it into my phone and got sparks in return. If I had been out of the room, it would have caught my bed on fire. Had my phone checked at a local repair shop and they warned me that off-brand cables and charging blocks are not made to the exact same size specs as brand-name ones are because that would be copyright infringement. The poor fit of off-brand cables causes many problems and I'm throwing the remaining cables out."
4.0 out of 5 stars;Work.;I haven't had one go bad yet, in about a year's worth of use of multiple cables in different places, including in the car.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Do not buy;Comes with a few cords, none of them work well.I’ve used them on a Nintendo Switch, Macbook and Bluetooth Headphones and only the headphones were able to charge. Would not recommend buying.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Meh.. Loose fit;Doesn't work well with s21 ultra. Charging port is clean of debris, without a case, and the cable still wobbles around. Sad thing is that it's ALL of them that wobble.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Quality;Great price, good gravity.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Cord lasts a few months - then goes to the trash;I ordered a pack of 5 cords - almost like clockwork after a few months each cord quits working.
2.0 out of 5 stars;USB-C connector is crap;Only had em for a week and already hate them. Something is off with the USB-C port. It doesn't feel right when you plug it in. You know how with any decent cable you can feel it when it fully connects? This doesn't do that. As a result, the connection is garbage. It WILL NOT stay connected.If you're never going to move the device once you plug it in, they're alright, maybe. But, practically speaking, they're frustrating and almost useless.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Works;Ok
2.0 out of 5 stars;Bought a 3 pack and all 3 cables have connection problems with multiple devices.;Doesn't work without special positioning. I will gi back to original samsung cables.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Gets the job done but not the best;Get what you pay for. Doesn’t charge as quickly as a real cable.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Like lipstick on a pig.;S20fe. Can't get better than slow charge no matter the source.  Exceptionally slow and inconsistent during attempted data transfers: often several minutes per gigabyte, more often lost signal and failed file swaps. But hey,  at least i can set my phone down anywhere in the room all week while it recharges the battery drain from leaving this review.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Metal tip is slightly long, does not insert completely, phone stops charging;These cables are very durable.  But after using these cables with different brand cell phones in the family, I found that the length of the metal tip is slightly longer than other brands of charging cables.The metal tip is only 1/2mm longer, but causes the contacts to disconnect and stop charging sometimes.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Just another regular charger cord;Good deal for 5 cords at 6' each. Bad deal if you expect them to charge faster than a standard cord.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Satisfied!;Fast charging, enough length
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good cable;Works great.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Best price out there;Decent charging cords, but ports bend pretty easily.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Supports Fast charge/ Quick charge;Update: 1/19/203 out of 5 cables had given up, 2 are still going. 2/3 came loose at the connector, 1 looks perfect but stopped working, while these are fast charging compatible, both samsung and moto complain about the cables. my JSAUX cables are still going strong after almost 10months.I had used few other generic brand USB-C cables in the pastSome of them were, Icesmart and JSAUX. These cables are pretty good starting from the build of cable and connector tips, this seems sturdy. 5 cables for 10$ at this quality is a steal deal for me especially as I keep losing the cables very often.and the best part, these are Fast charge compatible, which means your phone won't complain about the cable and charges fast at 2.5 amps
4.0 out of 5 stars;I would buy again if needing more.;Works as expected.  Seem very durable and good quality so far for the times they have been used.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Charges, But Intermittent Connections for Data Transfer & Poor Durability;Plastic caps at ends of cables come off easily. communication between phone and car or computer using the cable is intermittent...and has been for all 3 cables since just after the return period.  One good point: at least the wiring for the charging lines has continued to work for all three cables in package.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Amazon review;Came fast and work great
1.0 out of 5 stars;Cheap;They only lasted a month
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good;Good
2.0 out of 5 stars;Fragile;I see why it was a 5 pack. I left it plugged in and when pressure is put on it sideways, it sort of folds over. Charges ok if no sideways force is applied
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great for the price;These chargers works well with my phone and it charges fairly quickly. The amount of chargers you get for the price is worth it.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Worth Every Penny!;I was a little worried due to the cost but these cords are much more durable than the original type-E I got with my Galaxy S10E. Works great so far and is capable of fast charging. Great item!
4.0 out of 5 stars;The cords are thick and sturdy. I am looking forward to them lasting along ...;3ft is shorter than I expected. The cords are thick and sturdy. I am looking forward to them lasting along time. The packing is very nice!
3.0 out of 5 stars;Ok;Doesnt charge very well but does its job.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't charge well;If I use my phone at all while charging, it literally will not charge, it says it is but it's not. I started at 48% and now I'm at 44%. It seems durable and it looks nice but it doesn't charge phones quickly enough. Currently using my broken charger (has to be at a certain angle to work) while I type this review because at least it chargers my phone. Dont buy this charger unless you don't need your phone.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Decent purchase.;I received the cords, one out of the five cords did not work. Any movement caused it to disconnect. So I have 4 out of 5 cords that work. Overall a decent product except for the one broken cord.
5.0 out of 5 stars;More Bang for your Buck;They came in nice packaging that I am keeping to keep my cords in. The price was great and they work perfectly.
1.0 out of 5 stars;awful!;I drive for Amazon and each of these cords did not even last two full work days. they not only don’t charge after one day, they actually drained the battery on my device. you get what you pay for and pay for what you get. save your $$ and do not buy this product.
2.0 out of 5 stars;It does not support fast charging;The only reason I gave 2 stars is because the cables don't support fast charging.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good cords;Works like should
5.0 out of 5 stars;100/10;charge super fast ...
3.0 out of 5 stars;It's ok;The charger worked well for a while however after about two weeks there was a short in the charger wire
5.0 out of 5 stars;Flex- Cord;These do a great job to change fast when connected to a turbo charger head.
5.0 out of 5 stars;They work!;I've had these for 2 weeks and no problems yet! They work on my samsung galaxy s10 and microsoft tablet.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great price for a great product!;Great mutipack is charging cables. I can have several at home, at work, in my car, & in my bag so I'm never without one without spending a lot of money.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Do not buy.. .;I bought these about a week ago and none of them were fast charging and only one is working now.... Not sure if I got a bad batch of cords but I definitely wouldn't recommend buying them and taking the risk. They are nice n long but they don't charge.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Very convenient when upgrading your phone to one that uses the new plug.;Had to get additional power cables for my new phone.  Cabels take the current required for fast charging without a problem, and the cable count allowed me to replace all my charging stations in one go.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Does not support fast charging;Nice quality cords. They work well but do not support fast charging on any of my devices. Not a bad deal for a 5 pack of cables.
3.0 out of 5 stars;not sure;It seems my phone takes longer to charge using these cable.  I am not sure why but it seems odd.  As for anything else about the cables, they are a bit shorter than I needed but build quality seems good.
3.0 out of 5 stars;USB Type-C Cable 5pack 6ft;These were supposed to be rapid chargers and they are not at all!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Fire/burn hazard!;I bought these chargers back in April of 2021. We used them occasionally, but they ended up not lasting long. I recently found one and started using it at my desk, it was working fine for a couple weeks, but just now I got a notification on my phone to check my charger port, went to touch and burnt my finger. The end of the charger was melting and extremely hot. I pulled it out by the cord and unplugged it from the power bank. I do not recommend buying one of these.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Sloooooowwwwww;Feels sturdy but charges so slowly no matter what power source I use. It won’t keep my iPad Pro charged while I watch video.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Takes forever to charge my phone.;Low quality. Takes forever to charge my brand new phone.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Does not fast charge;Good back up cables for the price, but do not fast charger even with my Samsung adapter
3.0 out of 5 stars;Great Quality Braiding on Cables;3 Stars for Charging. I don't think these will give maximum quick charging.3 Stars for Data Transfer. I only got 40 mb/s from a USB 3.0 port. Anker braided gives me 250 mb/s transfer speed.5 Stars for Braided cord and connection end quality.
3.0 out of 5 stars;not fast charging;Had problems with connection and isn't fast charging
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charger;Not fast charger
1.0 out of 5 stars;Bad Cables. Buyer Beware! Do not buy.;"I rarely write reviews since most reviews we read are questionable at best. However, I have to say something regarding these USB cables. Every one of them ""went bad"" very quickly. By that, I was either getting warning pop-ups on my devices when I used these cables or they simply would not charge, period.I really don't know what sort of electronic wizardry goes into USB cables, but whatever this suppler used was from the dark side. I guess you get what you pay for at $2 (USD) a pop!"
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works and a good deal;Works
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great quality, good price I'd buy twice...A+;Tired of buying cheap.. But these seem to have decent reviews.. Im writing this after having them a few month with heavy use right as a purchase more for friends.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Buy them!;I like how the chords are a like more durable feeling then regular ones.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Horrible;Purchased 2 packs of these. And they stopped working within 2 weeks and i was unable to return/get refunded for them.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Very nice quality!;These power cords are high quality and charge extremely fast. Each cord is a different color so everyone has a designated cord on the power bank.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charging;I connected this cable to a known fast charger and it charged slowly. Tried another known fast cable to the same charger and it charged fast. Don't recommend this cable for fast charging.
1.0 out of 5 stars;FIRE RISK;DO NOT BUY!!!I was charging my phone, then I suddenly heard a crackling noise. I couldn't figure out what it was and it started smoking!I immediately pulled ot out of my phone and threw it without thinking and went to pull it from the plug. It melted my couch within the 15 seconds it touched it!Good thing I was using it, we charge our game controllers when we sleep, that would've started a fire and burned our home down!!!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Good quality, but not durable.;The cords are fast charging, but only 2 of them were working upon arrival.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Nice  product;I would buy them again.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not 6ft;These cards are not 6 ft. They are about 1 to 1 1/2 feet.
1.0 out of 5 stars;These are definitely NOT fast charging.  I will be returning them!;They are definitely not fast charging.  I tried them in my Samsung wall box and they charge very slow.  I tried them on my car it says 3 hours and 1 min to charge from 50%.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Looks great, durability not so much.;I love the build quality of these cables however after that everything goes downhill.  After using the cable for less than a month I started getting the low so slow charge warning on my cable.  I then tried connecting this in my car for Android Auto and got nothing until I bent the cable back at a 70+ degree angle.  I thought it was an issue with phone at first but I then discovered that the OEM cable (being twice as skinny) worked without a hitch.  I was really rooting for these cables to be a solution as I wanted to buy more.  I'd say save your money on this one.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Dose not fast charge at all!!!;I used two quick charge 3.0 devices a wall charger and Anker powerbank and both are certified. These cables can not charge my cell nor my co workers cell at all it can can not even stay powered while I use my power bank this is the only cable I have ever had do this not to mention only slow charge while using fast/quick charging devices. This is horrible. It feels super comfortable and looks beautiful but it's purpose to charge is simply horrible. I tried using four out of the five and same issues. I am going bank to Anker I at least know I pay for quality even though they are a bit pricey.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Fabric;Very stiff
3.0 out of 5 stars;Some cables didn't work at all;Some cables didn't even work.
5.0 out of 5 stars;My mistake in purchasing;These chords do not provide fast charging. The description is inaccurate.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Break quickly;The wires stop working after only a month or so.
5.0 out of 5 stars;phones;nice
2.0 out of 5 stars;SLOW charger;Takes 4.5 hrs to full charge. Not a fast type charger as advertised.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good products;Good products, good quality
5.0 out of 5 stars;Nice product;Exactally as expected. I liked the nice touch of each being individually packaged within the same package separated by perforation. They feel and look of nice quality and each have a little smile face on them.
1.0 out of 5 stars;FIRE HAZARD;I bought these when all our phones switched to USB c. They worked great for a while, then the first one melted the cupholder in my car after a few months. I assumed being a cupholder that maybe there was some liquid in there that caused it. Fast forward to today, I came home to a burning smell in my kitchen this cold was plugged in to a base but nothing at all on the usb c end. I found it was so hot it was melting the cord and the lithium backup battery next to it... if you buy this , DO NOT LEAVE IT PLUGGED IN WHEN NOT IN USE. I am extremely lucky it did not burn my house down. By the way I only had this plugged into a 1.0 amp base, and as you can see in the picture there is no damage to the cord or the end.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Excellent buy and long length;Excellent buy and long length
3.0 out of 5 stars;They work but a piece came loose;A plastic piece at the USB C end came loose and now I have to fiddle with it every time I charge, which is an annoyance. Works fine otherwise.
2.0 out of 5 stars;MEH...braided sure but not exactly strong and rarely work on my quick charger for my S8 unless replug them in a few times. C-;Not as good as I had hoped, yes they're braided but one I use for my phone daily is already becoming quite used on the very end so the braiding isn't that big of a deal unless this was metal like nylabrand or something. They also are VERY picky with my Galaxy Phone. I never get Fast charging unless I pug and unplug the cable several times, whereas any other cable I have always fast charges...Not thrilled about them at all. They bend at the usb C end and stay like that and then start coming apart. ?ive bought these twice because of price but have the same issues so I won't buy them again.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great;Great
2.0 out of 5 stars;All 5 stopped working within a few months, worked great until then.;Worked great at first, but some started disconnecting within a few weeks and all of them broke within a few months.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Does not fast charge;Does not fast charge at all.
1.0 out of 5 stars;These fail VERY quickly;I can only imagine that the other reviews for these cables were posted before people used them for very long. ALL 5 OF THESE CABLES FAILED WITHIN A MONTH... If you order them, good luck...
4.0 out of 5 stars;Great price and work good for charging my phone;Great price and work good for charging my phone. The only complaint I have is that the cable itself is really thick.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Durability Problem;Three out of five have failed in under a month of normal daily use. I've never had a batch of cables fail so quickly. Will not buy anything that even looks like it came out of the same factory again.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Won't buy again.;Didn't last all of them had a short in them.
5.0 out of 5 stars;charging power;Its exactly what I needed
1.0 out of 5 stars;TAKES ALMOST 4 HOURS TO CHARGE;I'm not sure how this is Amazons top pick. Phone was at 15% and it said it would take 3 hours and 45 minutes to reach the full charge. All of the chargers were like that. Waste of money.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great value;Great value, solidly built.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Well worth it.;Well worth the purchase. Decent cables for the price. Dont hesitate.

3.0 out of 5 stars;slow charging;Tried several different charging adapters that all fast charge and none of these cord will fast charge.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good durable cables;Love these cables, they charge my phone fast and seem very durable.  Great value for the price.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Awesome;Perfect!!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging like description but will still get job done;The item itself seems pretty sturdy and feel like they will hold up to use. The length of the cords is nice too. One issue I have found is the description lists the cords as fast charging but I have not seen the fast charging actually happen. I have tried various usb plug adapters and car charger and still nothing. They still charge fairly well but really was looking forward to the fast charge capability.
1.0 out of 5 stars;The USB-C tip is too wide for Case.;The USB-C tip is too wide for my case. It does not insert far enough and does not lock in securely. Returned for refund.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Fits Moto G7 Power;These fit my Moto G7 Power. So far so good, mostly they are in storage for backups for when the current one fails.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Exceptional;Limited plugs in my apartment. Needed long charger cords
1.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped working after less than 2 weeks;Must have gotten duds as they stop charging after less than 2 weeks.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Too soon to tell but working well so far.;This feels like a good product, data transfers are quick, and charges devices well. however, one of the cables is already having issues as it connects and disconnects when the phone is moved while plugged in.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great quality and price.;Exactly as advertised.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Crisp;Clean
1.0 out of 5 stars;These are not lightening chargers.;Highly disappointed. These were supposed to charge things fast and they most definitely do not. Even plugged into a lightening box, they charge super slowly and break really easily.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Excelent;Excelent
3.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charging on Note 9;"Cable seems to be well made and sturdy .  A little bit stiff . Contrary to other reviews this cable is not a fast charging cable. My phone Note 9 notifies me that it's "" slow charging""when I use this cable."
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect size;Great product and sturdy craftmanship
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not a single one works;I was excited to try this charger I got a five pack and not a single one works, i tried different ports around the house and not one worked
2.0 out of 5 stars;Will not connect to iPad Pro;Construction quality is good, and I think they would last a long time. But, do NOT buy these with the intention of connecting any iPad Pro to anything. They will not communicate. It will keep trying, every 2 seconds. I ended up giving these to my daughter for use with her Samsung phone. Now she has all the cords she needs. :(
1.0 out of 5 stars;1 out of 5 cause that's how many work;Out of the 5 pack we have only had 1 that works consistently. None have worked for Android auto though. Only to charge the phone.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Del 100% de los cables, ninguno funciona.;No me funcionó un solo cable. Me parece muy extraño. Probé los 5, con diferentes cargadores, original de Apple primero, después adaptador de mac, otros. Ninguno funcionó.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Durability issue.;Product seems great and feels sturdy but after limited use the plug no longer stays in the phone's charging port. The cover on the usb-c end is also sliding off.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Charging cor;It  is actually  longer than I needed.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Broke;I night them and I think in 2 month all broke down and gone.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good back up.;I have only had this for a few weeks. It is sturdy and changes but not fast. I would recommend it as a backup/spare.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good;All of them work perfectly. I like the smiley face on them, so you know which is is which. Sturdy and durable. Nothing to complain about.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great quality and fast chargers.;These are good chargers that charge your phone fast.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Durable cable, tight connection;Seems like a decent cable, but a bit too stiff for what easy use.  The USB-C connector is VERY tight.  To the point where I feel I may damage the port on the phone.  For that reason I don't think I'll use these cables.  Fast charge.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Look and feel durable but might lose connection;The cable looks like it wont break easily, but while using it in my car with Android Auto it keep losing connection, on both my Galaxy S9 and my wife's Note 10+
3.0 out of 5 stars;They don't snap into device 100%;"I've used these for the past week. They charge and transfer data fine if they are positioned ""just right."" They do not connect positively to my devices. Anker cables are better. These are just cheaper."
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not a fast charge, slowest cord compared to my other cords;I got this because of the star reviews. I have tried all the cords on different I phones and devices, along with different outlets in my house, other people's house, and cars everytime it's over 5-8 hours of charging time, when my other cords are 1-2 hours charge when I plug them in right after trying this cord, or putting my phone on a wireless charger. Very disappointed
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great but not fast;Strong cable, but isn't fast charging at all with a lightning adapter.
1.0 out of 5 stars;not fast charging at all...;These cords are not capable of fast charging at all. I bought some cheap ones from the gas station and cut down my charge time in 1/2 the time as these.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging;Charging power
5.0 out of 5 stars;Quality;Fit securely, fast charging, durable.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Unreliable connection;They do not always make contact with the USB ports... They need to be wiggles or proped just right. I would not recommend these. I had this problem with every single one from the set, tested on multiple devices.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Great;N/a
2.0 out of 5 stars;They've stopped working;They stopped working after a few weeks.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Bad quality!;Very bad quality!!!I bought  the 5 pack  in February  and i need to buy other cables  now because  one by one stopped  working, they  don't  charging non of my phones or tablets any more!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Sturdy cable;Very sturdy charging cable.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Cable got hot charging phone and burned granddaughters finger.;Been using these cables for awhile and everything was fine until one of the cables got hot enough to melts plastic. The charger I was using wasn't a fast charger. I feel that if this cable was plugged in longer it could've started a fire. The phone had zero percent battery and was plugged in for an hr. After child got burned we tried to start phone and it was still at zero charge. Plugged different cable and phone started charging normally and battery percent went to 1 percent after a few moments. I have the bad cable and can upload a photo if needed.
5.0 out of 5 stars;No probs;I rec'd these about a week ago. So far they work great and charge my phone quickly.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good Quality;Got to have multiple cables for charging my phone.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Best bang for your buck;Good chargers charges fast does the job
1.0 out of 5 stars;These are the first ever cables that don't work. Probably using fake reviews.;I bought this pack feeling like I had circumvented the emergency need to buy overpriced gas station USBCs . At least those worked every time. I have tried 3 cables from this pack and none of them seem to be able to transmit power.I will be returning these.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Only came with 4 cords.;Amazon doesn't have an option to correct this without me having to send all of them back even if the four I have work fine. I need them now, so it's very frustrating.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Excellent product.;Excellent product. This is the best and most durable charger I have found. IT DOES NOT BREAK LIKE EVERY OTHER CHARGER. One of a kind!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Very Finicky with my S9;The wire looks great, heavy gauge, etc.  However, I have issues with it charging my s9, it just does not say in the charge port.  If I plug it in set it down and dont move it all is well.  If I try to charge and use the phone at the same time charging starts/stops.  Similar if I try to charge while in my car.  Its happens with multiple of the wires unfortunately.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Longer life span;Fast charging
4.0 out of 5 stars;Type C cords;These cords seem well made.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not what I need 😔;Connecting to doves some of the time not all the time.

2.0 out of 5 stars;No duro nada;Buen producto, el largo del cable era excelente, pero comenzó a despegarse la carcasa plástica del conector eso provocó que el conector quedara débil y hacia mal contacto en el celular

2.0 out of 5 stars;Bad fit that does not stay connected to devices;I have used these cables with a number of USB c devices and the connector does not fit snug and often falls out.  Would not recommend these cables
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;They work pretty good. Just make sure you have a power brick that can handle the charge.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not durable;Were it connects to the phone a plactic cover is not glue good it cama off after 2 day. Quality not to good but does charge fast.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Love these type c cables;Love these type c cables. Very sturdy and made very well. I purchased five just in case one or more didnt work. But, im still on my first one and its been months. Love it!!

5.0 out of 5 stars;Durabnle Fast Charging;Fast charging, durable material, on time delivery.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works as described.;Came when they were supposed to and all seems good. I will give an update on durability if they wear out quickly. But otherwise, they are great.

3.0 out of 5 stars;Ok charger i have samsung galaxy phone and it does not support fast charging;Fast charging does not work sorry
2.0 out of 5 stars;Thicker and less flexible;The cable is thicker than other braided cables and less flexible. After a week of use the cable still has the bends in it from when it was in it's original packaging.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not as advertised;It's not 6 feet. It is 5 feet, 6 inches end-to-end. It is not very durable. It charges now, but I'm skeptical that it will last long because it is obviously not high-quality. Why Amazon recommends this is beyond me.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Extremely slow charging;When used with my phone it will take more than 9 hours to charge.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Pack of 5, only 2 in opened package;Only 2 of 5 cables arrived. The package had been opened and stapled closed.
5.0 out of 5 stars;They work a designed.;I'm really impressed with these low cost Type C charging cables. They're just the perfect length for the car or laptop use.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Stopped working;Just like all the rest of the cheap cords. They stop working. Seriously what does it take to make a durable charging cable?
5.0 out of 5 stars;Work very well;Was looking for this length with assigned specifications, purchased these. They have worked flawlessly so far.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Ok;Works good wires are strong won't break easy but does not like to stay plugged in to my or my wife's phones when driving
5.0 out of 5 stars;Nice to have a stash;I use them to charge my Samsung S9 at the house, in the car, at the office and at my cousin's.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not worth the price to break in 5 days;Needed them since my phone only came with a chord that didn't fit into a USB block. Was super excited since these seemed like they would work for a longer time then what I was used to for the phone I had traded in. Unfortunately, they are not which is pretty sad considering my ones were from the dollar store...
1.0 out of 5 stars;Terrible;These cords wear out super fast and have a terrible connection.  Do not purchase this product
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good quality cable for the money.;Love the shorter cable for car. Very sturdy.
5.0 out of 5 stars;would buy again and again!;Great cord. Very sturdy and they work great!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Half don't work out of the package;Beware. Half of these do not work out of the package brand new. Also braiding starts to come loose after a while
5.0 out of 5 stars;Easy th use and well made of quality material.;The USB Ccables are well made and the cloth coverings make them easy to find in my tangle of charger cords without looking sturdy and flexible. Well worth buying the multi pack.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Terrible at charging;I am constantly getting a message on my phone that it's slow charging.  It also heats up my phone. Not good chargers.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not actually quick charging;This is just blatant false advertising.  I bought these specifically because I wanted long quick-charging cables.  These are long but they aren't quick charging.
5.0 out of 5 stars;There are 5 chargers included.;There are 5 chargers included.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great cables;There really good cables, have not had a essue yet have had them for a few months

1.0 out of 5 stars;It's very slow charging;Don't buy this it is very slow and my phone take 10 + hours to charge and I just got new phone this week my bf phone also charged very slow
1.0 out of 5 stars;These do not work;These cords do not work. I would like a refund or a set of cords that work. They do not power  on at all.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Crapola;Do you get what you pay for? 5 for $10. Yep. They only work with a very powerful charge going through them, and then slowly. They're now my cables of last resort. The worst ones I have owned that don't function even when new. Can't handle a 1.0 amp charger
1.0 out of 5 stars;Does not charge;Wow it sucks so bad, like laughably bad. Length and durability as assumably right, but the problem is I can plug it into something that another cord could take maybe 2 hours to charge, and it says 18 hours, I doubt my phone is even charging at that point, it's probably just confused and dying slower.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good find.;Good price.
1.0 out of 5 stars;The wrong USB cables for what I needed them.;Nice cables, but the wrong USB cables I needed for our android phones and other products.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good Product;Will buy again
5.0 out of 5 stars;I a lot of bang for your buck!;These chargers are high quality, very surprising!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Excellent cables, perfect made and charge your phone as you expect;The cables are perfect, durable and attach to the phone perfectly. I will recommend it 3k (yes, like tony stark).
4.0 out of 5 stars;good product;easy to use and good quality!
4.0 out of 5 stars;Cables tipo c;Me parece buena calidad.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good but not so great.;The side that goes into the phone breaks super easy.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging;I plug my Samsung note 10 plus and I get a warning that it is slow charging will take 10 hours to charge. And if you are doing something while its on the charger it can't charge it fast enough it will die.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good buy;Love these... durable and appear well made.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Charging cable;I like how I have 5 pack for a decent price
1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesnt work at all, DONT BUY!;doesnt work at all, i threw them in my old tech box in my basement and i look forward to buying something else that works.Doesnt work well with my Oneplus 6T, it charges very slowly and i have to apply pressure and put it in at an angle, my original oneplus charger works without any of these flaws and it charges faster.Doesnt work in my Xiaomi Mi 10T Lite 5GDoesnt even fit in my Hyperx Origins 60% keyboard.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Does not work;None of the cables work
2.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't last;The cords worked well at first, however each one has slowly declined in reliability. For example, I'll plug my phone in to charge and it will say it will take 10hrs to fully charge. Also, when I plug the cords into my computer to transfer files from my phone, it will continuously disconnect on it's own. Overall, I'm disappointed and frustrated that I need to find new cords (again) when they are only about a year old.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not 6ft cords;Not 6ft cords, cords all together equal 6ft
5.0 out of 5 stars;love it;perfect
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging;This was not a fast charging cable as informed
3.0 out of 5 stars;its okay;break easily
2.0 out of 5 stars;Way too stiff;I guess sturdy means extremely stiff. If you need cables for your car these are way too stiff. If you are attaching to a device you are not moving these will work. Sorry I bought these for my use
3.0 out of 5 stars;Poor quality;My husband ordered these for his Samsung 8. He was disappointed, said they weren't work very well. Still have to return them.
1.0 out of 5 stars;One if these chargers doesn't work;I haven't tried the others yet.  They arrived quickly and in good condition but the only one that I have tried so far, took the phone up only 2% in 45 minutes!  So I gave up on it.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Useful;Is great cable!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Dosen't last;Product works good at first after a week of use you need to start playing with the connection for it to charge.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Just not the charger for me;I gave 3 away with no complaints besides 1 person saying their phone doesn't hold a charge anymore since using the chargers. Now I kept 2. One is still new scared to use. The other MIGHT'VE blown my phone out and didn't give me a full charge ever and then my phone never came back on. It was a new Stylo 4i only had 3 weeks. 1 person said their phone still working great so I'm iffy.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works well;Works as advertised
3.0 out of 5 stars;Good;Good stuff
3.0 out of 5 stars;Do the job but you get what you pay for.;Seemingly well made cables, do seem to fit a tad bit snugger than most of the cables I've used but that could be a positive.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Top quality, True Deal!;Nice suprise! A True Deal with exceptional quality. Even a knitted wrapped outer cover, Sweet.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good Quality;Great Cables, a few of these will help you phase out the old USB standard.
2.0 out of 5 stars;All failed within 5 months;Two of these did not work from the beginning. The rest have failed to charge each lasting  4-6 weeks. I now have one left that gives me a message on my phone saying there is a slow charge.
2.0 out of 5 stars;NOT fast charging;It will charge, but it definitely takes longer to fully charge than the cord that came with my Samsung Galaxy.
5.0 out of 5 stars;power cords;do like this power cords.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't last long.;It works great for a week or so as fast charging then it stops charging all together. I've gone through all 5 cables now and this last cable isn't fast charging.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Reduce the long charging cable;Needed a 3ft charging cable inside my vehicle, works great sofar.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Does not charge well;Bought these and have used only once but they do not charge. Took out in class to charge my tablet and it would not keep up, kept plugged into another cord from the same pack overnight and still was not halfway charged. I cannot return them unfortunately.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Very stiff cable. I don't like em!;Like you, I needed some new charging cables. Thought I'd give these a try. Got them quick & all was good from the seller. But the cables are stiff, not very flexible. I find that I just don't like them. Now I gotta try something else.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Will update later;Ok so far, but have dissapointed by so many cables in the past, so I will update later..
2.0 out of 5 stars;Fast as a snail!;My wireless charger charges faster than these cords. I wanted durable fast cords for in the home and car, they ARE NOT FAST! It doesn't take 4+hrs to charge a phone that started at 40%.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging!;Not even close to fast charge. Save your money.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works well as replacement cables for USB-C;They do a great job as replacement cables for charging my Samsung S8 which uses USB-C
2.0 out of 5 stars;Does not last more than a year;Lasted a few months
4.0 out of 5 stars;Four Stars;Great item strong threaded wire prefect for quick charge
2.0 out of 5 stars;Expected better quality;The charge fast but the quality is not what I expected, one of the cables broke just after two weeks of use
1.0 out of 5 stars;Pass;All the cables didn't charge my note20 😪
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not very flexible but adequate.;These are not as flexible as I would like but otherwise seem to be okay.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good;It is good
1.0 out of 5 stars;Slow to no charge;Literally will not change anything. Came with 5 cords and only one worked.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great price;Great price for 5.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great buy;Cables work great
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good;Exelente products and quality price thank you
1.0 out of 5 stars;Great build, slowest charge ever!!!;This product looks as described and appears durable. Unfortunately nobody could bear use them as they charged...so ....s..l..o..w..l..y!!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Wrong size charger;Had to return-the end which fits into the iPad was too big-at least I received it
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not as advertised;Of the five that came in the pack, only 2 were usable. Fast charge does work if you have a fast charge block, but that is not always possible. If you use anything other than a fast charge block, they will barely trickle charge. Galaxy Note 10 lost charge while plugged in. Nintendo Switch gained 2 percent in a hour.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great;This is a good deal plus very very durable.
2.0 out of 5 stars;NOT 6FT;These were NOT 6ft. They were MAYBE 5ft. False advertising!!! The only reason I didn't give 1 star is because they seem to be durable.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not very durable;Not a very durable cable. The plastic that covers the USB came off.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Won't stay connected to phone;These cables suck. They refuse to stay connected to our phones. The slightest jolt and they stop charging your phone. Avoid at all costs. They're worse then the broken ones they were bought to replace
5.0 out of 5 stars;Still my best cables.;Got them a while back. Still my best cables.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Failing;After not much use these are failing to maintain contact at the phone end plug.  Not a good product.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great quality;I was surprised at the great quality considering the price. Very happy!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Worked briefly, then not;Worked great for about 2 weeks. Then it would onlt fast charge in one direction. Printed side down. Now it takes 6 hours to charge the phone. Unfortunately you are better off paying more for OEM product
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not a rapid charger;Definitely not a fast charger but does charge as regular  cable. I tried 3 cables on 2 different phones and adaptors with same result
5.0 out of 5 stars;Perfect;Perfect
1.0 out of 5 stars;Nice for the price but not amazing .;These chargers charge good like in 2 hours my phone will be full from 0 to 100 but other chargers would take only an hour and ten minutes so these are good but not great . Update:: these are absolutely horrible they charged my phone for about a week but now it says 6 hours until fully charged very very bad just pay more and get something that works .
1.0 out of 5 stars;Don't Bend It!;You get what you pay for. Went through a whole 5-pack in a little over six months
1.0 out of 5 stars;Junk;They worked a week now takes  5 hours to charge my phone instead 2 lol
1.0 out of 5 stars;Failed in a week;3/5 cables failed while charging galaxy note 9 within 1 week. Maybe I got a bad batch? Regardless I have no faith in the longevity of these cables and will be looking elsewhere for quality cables. Really disappointed because these were a lightning deal, some things are too good to be true. Would not reccomend to others.Edit 6/28merchant emailed me and said they would refund my order if i changed my review. while it's a nice gesture, the woman proceeded to blame the faulty cables on a manufacturer's problem and assured me they switched suppliers. I would proceed with caution when buying anything from this seller.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Takes too long to charge;It’s just taking forever for my computer to charge up with this.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not worth it;Bought these a couple weeks ago. They get a short in them quickly
3.0 out of 5 stars;Too short;Pretty much too short to be very useful
1.0 out of 5 stars;Extremely poor quality and durability;The type C connectors on all 5 cables are so poor that they make intermittent contact with my phone.  I have extreme trouble making contact at all.  I am throwing them all out and will buy Samsung cables.  BTW, my one Samsung cable works great on my phone.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charger;They don't charge fast.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't last;Bought this 6 months ago.  The first one has already quit charging.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Buyer beware;You know through the years I brought many cable cord speed on the charger cord for my phone enable all fantastic.DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY. They lasted about not even a month first you got a plug it in and it works great week later you plug it in doesn’t work you pull it out plug it in on the other side and it works what color charge cord only works on one side and then they completely go dead so all the cords at kim the package died within a month.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Quality cord.;Very nice product.  Excellent price.  I will order more.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Slows Charginng;Cable charges about half as fast as my previous one on the same charger.  Otherwise, it works fine, but I bought it for my car using Google Maps and it doesn't keep up  with the battery drain keeping Maps open.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Charge good. Build quality bad.;Plastic trim/cover on charging end came off on two of the cables so far. One didn't stay on longer than. The first week. Charges well though.
1.0 out of 5 stars;I had cable plugged into USB port and it burned my hand. I have blisters;I have NEVER had telephone charge cable do something like this. I took hold of end that connects to phone and it immediately burned blisters onto my thumb and forefinger. I unplugged threw on floor and my grandson asked problem. Was still so hot it burned his hand too
5.0 out of 5 stars;Fast and durable;Durability
5.0 out of 5 stars;Five Stars;high speed charge and data transfer no issues have been using them for over a month
5.0 out of 5 stars;They work!;They do what they are suppose to
1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't charge while phone in use.;Not sure if this is by design or I got defects cable.My pixel 6 pro will not charge while phone in use.Besides looking durable, it pretty much useless...Update:. It stopped charging altogether now only just a couple months of very limited usage
2.0 out of 5 stars;Well built, but stiff and doesn't stay plugged in;These cods are well built and appear to be sturdy.  However, they do not stay plugged in to my phone (it is an S8).  Any little movement and they come unplugged.

1.0 out of 5 stars;They stop working;They stop working
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not flexible;I took off 1 star because they are not very flexible.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Temp USB;These subs work fantastic in the beginning. but after a few months, you'll be replacing them.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works great;Works great.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Useless;I bought this for the company I work for and they started failing the week we got them. Had to buy new ones
5.0 out of 5 stars;Made well;Fast charges Note 9.  Made well.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Definitely buy it. It's worth it.;Works better then most cables and very sturdy
1.0 out of 5 stars;Product was not for an I-phone!;The product was bought for an I-phone and of course it does not work with an I-phone. Shame on me. Shame on you for not making it clear that the product would not work with an I-phone. Sometimes you need to protect us from ourselves.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not durable!;When I received the product I was very excited. The cables are thick and seem very durable. 20 days later, the one I use the most, maybe 3 times a week, will not rapid charge my phone anymore. Not sure what happened but very dissapointed. I would not buy these again. Back to the drawing board on looking for good cables.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good chargers;Loved them. Fast and durable.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charging.;This cord triggered the slow charge alert.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Overheats;Purchased in 1/2022 by 3/2022 three of them went to slow charging, 4/2022 one starts to overheat. I should have bought a good quality charger, not these hazardous cords. DO NOT BUY!!!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Stop. Do. Not. Purchase.;All of them worked for a few days or so before they shorted out. Would start disconnecting, or wouldn’t connect in the car. It was a waste not just with my phone by boyfriends as well. Purchase a name brand cord and don’t mess with the hassle.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Better than expected for a budget bundle;Been using them for a few weeks now. Seem to be of very good quality and feel very sturdy.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Scared to use it!;Hadn't even made it to plug in before it was falling apart!.  The sleeve that covers the type c charging piece fell off!  I hadn't even touched it.  Makes me a bit concerned about the safety of using any of it!
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not so good;I'm sorry I have to rate these so low. They will not stay connected. I have no trouble with the cable supplied with the phone so I know it is not the phone that is in problem. No charging and no connection indicated by the phone.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Meh - Phone connector iffy and no fast charging;Great price for 5 cords, but they are of questionable quality.  What do you expect for this price right?  They will not transmit data nor do fast charging reliably.  Several of the ones we bought no longer make good connection with the phone.  I'm going to have to buy a higher quality product, so this was really a waste of money.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Very good and sturdy product.;Longer cord.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't fast charge android A03s  tried many adapter boxes;Length is good price is good wish it fast charged my phones though.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Pretty disappointed;Bad design. You get what you pay for.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Does the job;Awesome
5.0 out of 5 stars;👍;👍
2.0 out of 5 stars;Disposable USB-C;Three of the cords no longer charging.  I mean I purchased about 10 months ago but shouldn't the cords last longer than this?  In hindsight, next time I will pay a little more for better quality.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Absolute waste of money;"Each of these cords was a total bust. I had to insert and remove the cord several times in order to find the ""special position"" where my phone would fast charge. The default charge speed was slow charging, and I would watch as my phone's battery would drain faster than it charged. This was the case with every single cord. Do not buy these, these are complete trash."
1.0 out of 5 stars;each one failed in less than a month;Each cable failed after less than 1 month each. I don't recommend this brand.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Don't recommend;Not a fast charger. Charges slow. actually decreased percentage while charging.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Wasn't Fast Charging;My phone would tell me there was an issue with the cord every time I plugged it in. It would charge, but take about 4 times longer than my original fast charging cord from Samsung.
1.0 out of 5 stars;doesn't charge my ipad pro;I am really disappointed. with all the reviews saying how good these were I was excited to get them. Yet, I get the same message I always do when I get 3rd party chargers for apple products. I plug it into my Ipad Pro and it comes up with a not charging message or this product isn't supported. Will return. I am really bummed because apple chargers are just so expensive
1.0 out of 5 stars;This is not fast charging!!;This is the slowest charging cord I've ever used.  I would never recommend these!!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great set of cables;Really good quality.  I love these.
2.0 out of 5 stars;One didn't work.;One didn't work but the others were fine.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Garbage;Like many others have said the cable us junk. Doesn't stay in charging port.  I wake up to no charge.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging;Charges slowly, cable quality is questionable.
1.0 out of 5 stars;I did not get  6 foot cords. FALSE ADVERTISING!;It wasnt as described it is not 6 feet long
1.0 out of 5 stars;Did not work;None of the cables would charge. Hooked up an older cable I had. It worked. So these are defective.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not the best;I bought 2 from that one, one of them all the cables worked fine the other one 2/3 didn’t work at all
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good value;They seem like good tough cords.
1.0 out of 5 stars;It sucks with charging;It has been on the charger 2 hours and is only at 49%
2.0 out of 5 stars;Very hit or miss when it comes to fast charging;The cords themselves are good quality and quite sturdy, but I find that they rarely fast charge my Moto Z4, regardless of which charger I am using.  They also seem to back out of the charging port quite easily, much easier than similar cords I have purchased.
1.0 out of 5 stars;None of them worked. 5 cables, all defective.;Horrible product. Do not buy.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Don't charge at all.;These cables do not charge at all.

3.0 out of 5 stars;The cables to their job. However, the seem ...;The cables to their job. However, the seem a bit loose sometimes compared to the ones that came with my phone.
1.0 out of 5 stars;You get what you pay for.;One of the cords did not work at all out of the pack. Two were defective resulting in slow charging. One stopped charging after a week. So out of 5 cords I have one that still works a month later. But at least they're long 🤷‍♂️
1.0 out of 5 stars;Cannot charge my phone, not rated correctly.;I bought these short because I got tired of the bigger ones breaking so quick. Lo and behold it didn't even matter because my phone promises me it connects to a low power charger and after hours it maybe goes up 3%. Useless
2.0 out of 5 stars;All broke within weeks of using.;Every one stopped connecting and charging after just a couple weeks of use
1.0 out of 5 stars;The end of the cord pops off;
1.0 out of 5 stars;not fast charging;the charger isnt fast charging and some doesnt work
1.0 out of 5 stars;Fried my phone in less than an hour.;Turned my phone into a brick. Just plugged it in with the new cord as I usually do. I've used several different cords to charge my Pixel 3 in the past. This one fried it. Won't power on, completely unresponsive. Buyer beware!

1.0 out of 5 stars;Typical bad amazon search;I did a search for charge cords for my samsung cell phone droid charge cable and it's not for the droid but a newer phone.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great!;Arrived fast and they work! I don't know what more you could ask for the price
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great quality;Nicely made wires, looks like they will last a good while
2.0 out of 5 stars;Falls out;Plug doesn't seem to click in to place very well. If you move it a round it fall out of phone.
1.0 out of 5 stars;not fast charging capable;description is inaccurate
3.0 out of 5 stars;Stylish but avg quality;Quick shipment. Stylish. however, connections broke within several months. Not impressed with the quality
1.0 out of 5 stars;Last about only a month each in the car;Don't last very long in the car
5.0 out of 5 stars;Well build charger cables;Very well built and sturdy.
2.0 out of 5 stars;[Braided] Cable not flexible;The current version of this cable is very stiff and inflexible.  It wants to keep it's own shape (can't straighten completely).  It's not what one would expect from a braided cable.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works great;Good quality charging cables.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Don't Fast Charge or Stay Connected to Devices;Stay away.  Cables don't fast charge and won't stay connected to devices.  Issues with multiple devices using these cables.  Look at most recent reviews.  Returned.
2.0 out of 5 stars;No durability;Not one of these cables lasted more than two weeks
1.0 out of 5 stars;Garbage;These are absolute trash! Of the five one didn't speed charge right out of the package. It and another started overheating to the point of not being able to touch. Only one is still working and it's starting to not speed charge sporadically. I've had them for 51 days from April 2 to today May 22.  They've been used on a Galaxy Note 8 and a Galaxy 10s. Worthless waste of money, don't purchase them. You've been warned!
1.0 out of 5 stars;no charge , no data sync , do not buy, slow data transfer;no charge , no data sync , do not buy freeze
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not one of them worked to charge a Samsung cell phone;These do not work for charging a cell phone. Opened and tried all 5 with different chargers and not one of them worked. Phone threw an error message on every single one.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Dont fit anything;I thought these would be universal chargers that would fit many items....they fit nothing. I've tried giving them away, they literally are malformed or something. Garbage.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Crappy cords;The last woven cords like this lasted over a year. A single cord hasn't made it a month. Not worth wasting money on this brand.
5.0 out of 5 stars;nicely done;i use these on my S8... no tangle ,no dangle , good fast charge....
2.0 out of 5 stars;Beware of quality;3 of the 5 cables were dented on the big usb side and had to stick a knife in to bend them back out....didn't work I'll buy better quality next time I've already thrown these in the trash
3.0 out of 5 stars;Lots of wasted packaging;Product works fine, just very excessive packaging.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Slow;Slow charging
2.0 out of 5 stars;NOT a fast charging cable.;Its supposed to be a fast charging cable but its definitely not. It takes about 4 hours to charge my note 10.
1.0 out of 5 stars;NOT A FAST CHARGING CABLE;The description of this charger says it is fast charging but it definitely is NOT A FAST CHARGING CABLE! It takes forever to charge my phone and I have a brand new galaxy s21 ultra.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Great build, sketchy internal quality?;3 out of 5 could fast charge, but other than that, it's a great product.
1.0 out of 5 stars;They don’t work;Of the 5, two didn’t work at all and another only worked for about a week.
1.0 out of 5 stars;didn't charge at all.  C-head is too short to reach the contact surface of the phone;didn't charge at all.  C-head is too short to reach the contact surface of the phone
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging, Came broken;These cords are definitively not fast charging as advertised. They also break easily and one never worked on arrival.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Too stiff;These do the job, they haven't ripped but I don't like them. They are too stiff for whatever reason, maybe it's the material. But instead draping down as a regular charging cable they stick straight up and never lose the bends that they get from being packaged.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Would buy again;Great
2.0 out of 5 stars;Don't last;They seem to only work for about 2 weeks and slowly each one stopped working
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not durable;Cord is breaking at connection after 2 uses
2.0 out of 5 stars;Poor durability;These work well enough initially, but they tend to only last a few months in heavier use situations like in a vehicle.  I've gone through 3 of them in a year from daily use in a car.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Ok for emergency;Not a very good quality …
1.0 out of 5 stars;They did not work es compatible cord as advertised.;It said it would work with my phone. It said it would fast charge. Plug it in the phone and the phone says not proper charge cord will not charge fast use proper cord for phone. The site said they would be fast charging compatible for my phone and it did not work.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Nothing works after 1 month;We have gone through 3 of these in a month and a half and another 2 are charging pretty slow. Durability is the worst. Don't recommend it
1.0 out of 5 stars;Does not work.;I guess there's a reason they are so cheap. I bought this and literally not a single one of them works. One of them kind of worse if I move my phone around in the right spot.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Loose connection on Notes and Galaxy phones;These are simply terrible. They don't fit in tightly (might be phone specific but for both the Note 9 and Galaxy 8 having the same issues). If I move the phone around , I risk the connection screwing up. You don't know what you are going to get with these upon a charge. It may start off with slow charging and you have to push and unplug it to get it right. If you move it though , forget it. Pass on this trash.
1.0 out of 5 stars;didn't fit;said it was universal and it did not fit .
2.0 out of 5 stars;Could have been great.;C-type port cover already falling off, it could have been a great product. Big disappointment!!!!
1.0 out of 5 stars;"Cable ""fits"" moto G6 but doesn't charge";"The cord technically does ""fit"" inside the charging part for my phone, a Motorola G6, but it doesn't actually make a charge connection most of the time, and if I can wiggle it into the right spot, slight motion makes it lose that connection. Not very happy with this purchase."
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works;All charging cords worked as inteneded. Very happy
2.0 out of 5 stars;.;For some reasons the charger won't stay in the port, very loose.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Doesn't support Quick change;Cables don't support quick change
1.0 out of 5 stars;Smoking;Wire seemed to be great. Till it started smoking and sparking. Thank Goodness nothing was plugged in! Going to throw all the cables out. Not worth the fire risk!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Did not fast charge;The set I received did not fast charge
2.0 out of 5 stars;Ok;These was returned...order the wrong  one.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Buy again;Great product excellent service

2.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging;Not fast charging. Takes 8hrs to charge phone from 20% to 100%
1.0 out of 5 stars;Absolute junk;Had these hooked up for a week and not a single device will recognize the cable being connected to it and therefore won't charge anything.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Don't support fast charging as claimed;They do not support fast-charging which is the only feature I needed.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Love it;I love these, they're well made.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging;At least the cables i got are not fast charging and that's using the correct wall connector. The length is perfect and durability is good, I've only had them for a week. Wish they charged faster, maybe i got a bad batch.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Does not work with android auto;Does not work with android auto
1.0 out of 5 stars;Burned and damaged upon delivery.;Cables seem durable like other cabled chargers. The quality in delivery is absolutely unacceptable. There are burns on the package that has melted the charger to the wires and a missing charger. 2 seem undamaged but I'm returning this as 3 are not.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Seriously?;1½ hours for 20%? Really? I hate leaving bad reviews.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Five Stars;Been using for a bit now and loving them
1.0 out of 5 stars;Defective;My phone got VERY hot charging with this cord. Switched to a different cord I already had, and my phone stayed cool. Returned for refund.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Too hard to insert;I tried to save a few dollars by buying these over Apple cables. These are hard to insert and pull out and the cable is very thick and bulky. Going back to buying Apple cables.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not satisfied 😕;Cable does not stay in. Any slight movement of phone will cause it to lose contact or become unplugged.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Don't waste your money!;3 of the 6 cords did not work at all. The other three worked for about a week and now don't work either! I already got rid of some or I would send back!!!!
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great buy;Product just as described no issues great service
5.0 out of 5 stars;Impressed - very high quality cable;These are excellent well built cables
2.0 out of 5 stars;Disappointed;Cables started to fail after only a couple months of part tine use.  Multiple cables had sleeve ar type c connector side simply slide off.  Original cable that came with phone still works perfectly.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging;These are not fast charging cables.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Cumbersome cord;The cord is way too thick and barely flexible making it easy for the cord to disconnect from the phone charger port. Also the head (USB connector) is way too short and doesn't connect correctly making you have to shove the the cord into your phone which makes the cord once again disconnect from your phone easily. I wouldn't recommend.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Works Great;Form and function are perfect.  What's left to say?
2.0 out of 5 stars;Charges intermittently, not all the cables work;Although seemingly durable, Doesn’t always charge And the metal piece near the port came loose after weeks.

1.0 out of 5 stars;The worst charging cords I have ever purchased;They didn't charge fast but charged ok for the first month. Now NONE of them work at all! Literally, not 1! The quality is obviously terrible, don't waste your money
2.0 out of 5 stars;dont buy;the cable keeps coming off and it takes forever to charge my phone not even my old beaten cable takes that long
1.0 out of 5 stars;It stopped charging my phones;The cord worked well for the first few weeks but lately it's become a game of adjusting it in my devices for them to actually charge. I wish I could still return them.

3.0 out of 5 stars;So so;Does not fast charge my Note 8. Tried many different hubs
3.0 out of 5 stars;Seem heavy duty, but charge times are slow and all over the map;First, the charge time is slow and varies. I tried in a variety of outlets and adapters, and could never get them to charge as quickly as my Samsung factory cord. On average about 30% slower. The screen shots are the typical kind of results I see from these cords - note the range in the pics, not the main number.That's not an absolute deal killer for me, sometimes you need a long cord for work or whatever, and as long as it's got a net positive (not draining), it helps. Plus, I assumed the longer cords would lose a bit of power.These are thick and braided, with nicely reinforced necks, where shorts usually happen. Also a nice deep secure connection on the USB-C side.I do wish I had gotten an assortment with some shorter cables. Maybe you need 10 feet for a specific purpose (gaming, business, etc). I was just using to recharge my Samsung Note, and was tired of always being too far from the outlet, or from the dainty cords failing. But what I noticed was the extra weight from both the braiding and the length will pull on my phone, and I'm concerned it's going to pull  it off my desk or weaken my USB port. So that kind of defeats the purpose of the long cord.
3.0 out of 5 stars;If you like a big head and a thick cable;These heads on the USB-C side are very long, twice as long as head of  the cable that came with my Pixel.  The cable itself is also very thick.  If you like a big head and a thick cable...then this is the cable for you...but not for me.I was shorted a cable, only 4 when it says 5-pack, so i sent the lot back.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charging;Did not like the product quality
3.0 out of 5 stars;Work fine, but too thick;They work fine, but they are quite a bit thicker and therefore harder to use than other cables I've purchased.  Good price.
3.0 out of 5 stars;Slow charge;Slow charge
1.0 out of 5 stars;Failed within months;Unfortunately the first cable stopped working within 4 months of purchase and there is no option to get a refund or warranty replacement. Apparently very poor quality. Suggest paying more for a better quality item. I had this cord by my bed and charged my phone nightly and did not do anything to the cord that could explain why it stopped working.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not Compatible with iPad Pro (2018) for proper charging.;Cables aren't designed to handle proper higher watt charges. When my iPad Pro died I wasn't able to use this cable whatsoever to charge/turn on my dead iPad. I had to use a genuine USB-C cable from Apple.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging as advertised for Pixel 3a XL;So disappointed that I have used this cable with an OEM and a different adapter for my Pixel. It's not running fast charging at all. I know the adapters are good as they can do fast charging for my old Samsung phone with micro USB. Going to return it as it's no point to have 6 cables without fast charging.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Not for Apple Products;The sellers need to explicitly mention that this is not for use with Apple products.This cable will not charge:- MacBook (USB-C charging port)- iPad Pro (USB-C charging port) - tested with a 12W charging block and a USB port on a power bar.Save yourselves the hassle and stay away.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Only works on some of my devices.;I ordered these as a flash sale during Christmas. They work wonderfully with my Nintendo Switch.However, I purchased the 5 pack for use with my Samsung Galaxy S8+, and not a single one would make ANY connection with my phone, despite being the correct form factor. I wanted a dedicated charger for work, car, and home, but this companies shoddy quality thwarted my plans.To compare, my phone DOES take a (fast) charge with both my OEM cables, and another 2 pack of charging cables that I also purchased as another flash sale. It's just these cables that fell short.I ended up giving most of them away, as I could only really use 1 or 2 for my Nintendo Switch.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Charging takes forever;The price attracted me, but ordered a replacement from another vendor today b/c it takes so long to charge. Definitely not a fast charging replacement.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Cheap product that is actually expensive;Even though these are very cheap on sale, the quality is so bad that you will end up spending more when replacing them.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Not fast charging.;"Said it was fast charging. In reality it is "" slow"" charging."
1.0 out of 5 stars;good price;but wouldn't last long. few day change one.
1.0 out of 5 stars;The wiring cover is excellent. But three's one problem;The wiring cover is excellent. But three's one problem. The small end does not fit into the port of my cell phone, thank you very much!
1.0 out of 5 stars;Still looking;These out the box seem to all have shorts.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Don't buy !!!;Waste of moneyWill not stay plugged in
1.0 out of 5 stars;wrong;Not what i thought misleading
2.0 out of 5 stars;Very slow charging, returned;The charging time that usually takes my phone and hour said 5 hours for this charger. I tried direct wall outlet, extension cord, USB port, and different squares including a fast charging square but it still said 5 hours. I would not recommend this
5.0 out of 5 stars;Charges iPad Air 4 No Problem;I saw a bunch of reviews saying it won't charge the newer iPads, though I have not had any issue with charging my iPad Air 4. The cords are very well made, so much so that they feel more robust than the original Apple charger that came with it.
1.0 out of 5 stars;RIPOFF!!!;Not one cord lasted 24 hours, pure junk and Amazon should remove them I'm contacting Ohio's AG to file a claim for ripping me off
4.0 out of 5 stars;Work fine.;These cords work just as the description said. But they are stiff and hard to bend. Sometimes it is hard to find a place to set my phone because the cord is stiff and gets in the way.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Super;I'm really impressed at how good these are for the price I paid. They are durable and charge fast. They also stay in the phone very well.
5.0 out of 5 stars;does the job;Looks very well constructed. A little on the stiff side. This may make it a little awkward to stuff in a pocket or pocketbook, but for my use, it is just fine.
5.0 out of 5 stars;"Good stuff; great price; well packed & ships quickly";Excellent quality braided cables. They come in packaging that allows you to divide single cables - so you can put individual cables in stockings, etc. Very sturdy connections & braiding looks like these will last a while.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good value.;It is high speed and works well. Not sure how durable it is yet as I haven't had them very long. So far so good.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Don't waste your money....;SLOW....very slow at charging your phone. 16 points in 50 minutes. Not great at all. No wonder they're so cheap
4.0 out of 5 stars;Very stiff;Cables seem to be well made and fit good. Main issue is that they are very stiff  and not as flexible as other braided cables are
4.0 out of 5 stars;Good price;I have had these before for a different phone and they lasted pretty good.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good purchase;Works as advertised and expected. Good value for the price.
5.0 out of 5 stars;So Far So Good;Great value - they work great and have withstood my cats
5.0 out of 5 stars;Good price and they last;Been using them for about 6 months and they still look like new and i havent had any problems with them
1.0 out of 5 stars;Sent back;2 of 5 cables kept loosing connection.  It would  charge fine but data kept cutting out causing it to fail.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Simple, high quality, does what it promises;Great, love it. Just what I was looking for. Similar to Anker's higher-priced versions, but cheaper.
5.0 out of 5 stars;Great Stuff;They are working great!
5.0 out of 5 stars;A++;Perfect
4.0 out of 5 stars;Use right plug for wall outlet;Works good if you connect to right wall box or won’t charge

5.0 out of 5 stars;Great charger;Cord length was perfect and I like how durable the cord is, I don't have to worry about it freying.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Crap charge;50% phone battery life. When plugged in to charge.  Over 2 hours. Different outlets, different plugs,  and even flipping the the plug. Nothing worked. Not even a month old.
4.0 out of 5 stars;Chargers;It's okay but didn't charge phone that fast.
2.0 out of 5 stars;Will not connect regularly.;Constantly connects, then disconnects. When it does connect, it charges fast.
1.0 out of 5 stars;Defective;The product does not charge and it’s not sturdy.
