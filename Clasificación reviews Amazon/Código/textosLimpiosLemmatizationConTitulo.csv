stavo cercando da tempo una soluzione che non fosse il classico caricatore con filo e prolunga usb questo compatto e ha incluso un piccolo cappuccio di gomma per evitare sporco e urti molto pratico se utilizzato con prese orizzontali se l attacco usb verticale specialmente con un cinturino metallico come il mio un po pesante fatica restare magnificamente attaccato alla casa dell orologio non mai caduto per precauzione serro il cinturino quando lo carico tutto sommato terminus di prezzo lo ritengo un ottimo prodotto,4.0 out of 5 stars

l apple watch lo smartwatch che indubbiamente preferisco tra quelli che utilizzo ed anche quello da cui raramente mi separo viaggio e quando ho notato questo newdery caricabatterie usb magnetico mi ha incuriosito ed ho deciso di provarlo il dispositivo arriva una compatta pratica confezione del marchio e non appena rimosso ho riscontrato una discreta qualita progettuale e costruttiva con la scelta di materiali validi ben assemblati nel realizzare un piccolo dispositivo che mi ha trasmesso da subito buone sensazioni di utilizzo altri dispositivi per ricaricare viaggio il mio apple watch da mm della serie che rispetto questo newdery presentano una propria autonomia ovvero una batteria interna che qui manca ammetto che inizialmente avevo compreso che questo caricatore magnetico fosse simile ad altri ovvero che durante un viaggio fosse sufficiente porre sopra l orologio per avviare la ricarica mentre si tratta di un pur sempre pratico supporto di ricarica che necessita comunque di una alimentazione con porta usb tralasciando le mia iniziali sull effettivo vantaggio di avere un dispositivo da viaggio che sia esclusivamente un supporto e non un alimentatore autonomo messo alla prova questo newdery ho da subito apprezzato di come l innesto usb funzione con estrema sicurezza ed non solo collegandolo ad un computer fisso portatile anche ovviamente ad un alimentatore da muro per smartphone ed anche ovviamente nella porta usb della mia auto parte poi la colorazione rosa quasi confetto che rendono questo dispositivo femminile che maschile mi piaciuta la scelta di realizzarlo stile portachiavi e quindi dotato di un gancio che ne la grazie dimensioni compatte il design non male semplice linea e pulito con un sistema di aggancio del tappo che evita la perdita della copertura dell innesto usb oltre che per preservalo da sporcizie ed rotture sebbene devo ammettere che avrei preferito un gancio posteriore saldo magari acciaio rispetto ad un laccio pelle sintetica che sebbene risulta curato ed elegante potrebbe nel tempo logorarsi e tagliarsi alla prova della ricarica posizionando il mio apple watch sulla base ho riscontrato una buona potenza magnetica paragonabile alla base originale e ad altri dispositivi di buona efficienza che utilizzo con dei tempo di carica che ho trovato sufficientemente rapidi proporzione alla fonte cui ho collegato il dispositivo ovvero computer caricatore muro oppure porta usb dell auto nel complesso mi sento quindi di promuovere questo caricabatteria newdery per la ed costruttiva un dispositivo utile e pratico per un utilizzo ufficio viaggio auto che obbliga ad avere una fonte di non essendo autonomo con una propria batteria interna si tratta quindi di un valido aiuto che personalmente ritengo inferiore ad una base di ricarica per apple watch che essere indipendente e quindi utilizzato qualsiasi condizione e luogo volendo anche aperta campagna sulla cima di una montagna per che riguarda il prezzo di euro cui questo newdery viene al momento proposto maggio valuto che sia equilibrato per le caratteristiche del prodotto e la sua operativa quanto alla spedizione e consegna da parte di amazon sono state ancora una volta efficienti mi auguro che questa recensione possa esservi di aiuto e se avete dubbi quesiti non esitate chiedere,4.0 out of 5 stars
da ich meine apple watch laden mus und sie auch nachts trage reicht die zeit oft nicht au um sie ganz aufzuladen dann habe ich oft da problem das der ladestand der watch kritisch wird bevor ich sie zu hause nachladen kann da ich nicht da sperrige original mit der langen leitung mitnehmen war ich schon auf der suche nach einer handlichen da kriterium der handlichkeit da newdery wirklich optimal kleiner geht e kaum da finde ich richtig toll ich kann da problemlos jede hosentasche stecken wo e kaum platz wegnimmt und nicht auch macht e einen sehr robusten eindruck ist gut verarbeitet und e gibt keine grate nun habe ich endlich die die watch unterwegs fast laden zu da geeignete usb aufgrund de sehr geringen ladestroms fast zu finden sind sind z b auch pc oder notebook usb buchsen oder eine sogar kleine powerbanken geeignet mein einziger kleiner kritikpunkt ist die ladegeschwindigkeit um meine watch von auf zu laden hat e stunden minuten gedauert da ist nicht extrem langsam sondern bewegt sich auf einem niveau da auch viele einfache haben aber mit dem original von apple dauert eine ladung nur stunden hier ist also noch luft nach oben aber um die watch kurz nachzuladen um zu verhindern das sie sich aufgrund eines niedrigen ladestandes abschaltet reicht mir die ladegeschwindigkeit au diese bleibt den gesamten ladebereich bei ca minuten um nachzuladen dauert e ca minuten ich kann da jedem empfehlen der wie ich da problem hat mit der akkuladung oft nicht einen tag zu kommen,4.0 out of 5 stars
per quanto io non ami particolarmente il mondo apple casa abbiamo comunque un apple watch e quindi mi sono incuriosito nel vedere questo newdery caricabatterie usb se devo essere onesto alla fine il suo lavoro lo fa che bene decisamente molto compatto se ci troviamo nelle canne con la batteria e siamo sul lavoro posti dove non abbiamo portata il nostro caricatore originale questo risolvere egregiamente il problema come ferie invece di portarci dietro l originale ci basta una fonte usb e con questo oggettino non abbiamo problemi ovviamente la potenza e quindi di ricarica dipendono dalla fonte alla quale ci colleghiamo la forma ben studiata per renderlo meno ingombrante possibile la parte magnetica identica alla base originale le plastiche sono di se siete persone che rimangono spesso piedi con il proprio apple watch allora credo che questo oggettino vi possa aiutare ogni caso un idea carina e interessante io lo consiglio,4.0 out of 5 stars

medium could loaded mi personalmente la bateria de el reloj de apple tengo la version llega durar do aproximadamente con este cargador de newdery si te quedas estas punto de quedarte sin en el apple watch ante de ponerlo en modo ahorro de puedes usar este cargador movil que puedes llevar en el bolsillo mochila bolso incluso en tu propio llavero su e reducido e como una moneda de do euro tiene un conector usb el cual cuando esta en uso lo protege de los golpes polvo gracias una capucha que este lleva incorporada al cuerpo del cargador como veis en una de la fotos yo tenido que ponerle un adaptador usb usb c para poder conectarlo mi macbook pro el cual solo dispones de salidas usb c pero lo probado con un hub se carga perfectamente el reloj por el precio que tiene creo que merece la pena tenerlo echarlo en la mochila junto una power bank te aseguras de poder tener bateria para el movil reloj espero que esta haya sido,5.0 out of 5 stars
man glaubt gar nicht wie sinnvoll ein kleines die apple watch ist denn die uhr sich nur mit dieser art von ladepuck aufladen ist man aber unterwegs und die uhr hat fast keinen saft mehr kann man diesis kleine eine usb buchse z b vom laptop oder eines anderen usb laders stecken und die uhr drauflegen dabei ist da auch magnetisch genug da die uhr nicht sofort wenn nicht alles gerade ist ich denke sterne sind da angebracht,4.0 out of 5 stars
funziona piuttosto bene ed stato risolutivo molte occasioni si riassume queste poche parole il mio giudizio complessivo di questo supporto di ricarica usb per apple watch effetti lo sto utilizzando da circa tre settimane e pur avendo un comodo laccetto che ne consente l aggancio al portachiavi preferisco invece utilizzarlo automobile collegato ad un alimentatore da accendisigari nella pozzetto frontale della mia nissan qashqai lo ho sistemato innestato orizzontalmente ed alla bisogna appoggio sopra di esso il mio apple watch serie che rimane posizione grazie al magnete di cui dotato pratica nella mia esperienza quando lo faccio aderire orologio alla partenza e viaggio per circa un os arrivo l energia disponibile di circa il ritengo quindi che con poco di due ore lo smartwatch raggiunga la piena ricarica leggero colore simpatico ha un copri usb plastica gommata che rimane comunque connesso allo chassis quando rimosso dalla posizione di protezione questo per evitare di perderlo ovviamente nell uso scalda un minimo nulla di preoccupante il costo che equilibrato e comunque popolare il suo fiore occhiello e la cosa che lo rende un accessorio importante per chi possiede un apple watch e che come spesso ha di ricaricarlo movimento,4.0 out of 5 stars

caricatore per apple watch comodissimo viaggio compatto e con usb che entra entrambi versi con il tappo collegato al corpo con un piccolo cavo da non perderlo mai carina anche la colorazione blu per uscire dal classico bianco di apple come il piccolo dettaglio pelle per farlo sembrare premium nulla da segnalare riguardo la carica funziona benissimo forse non il veloce che io abbia mai testato usandolo di notte non un problema la mattina dopo il nostro apple watch sempre completamente carico io lo uso con un powerbank e lo trovo perfetto si anche usare direttamente su un caricatore muro sia rivolto verso l alto prezzo di decisamente contenuto rispetto originale apple un prodotto da avere,5.0 out of 5 stars

mi mujer se este cargador para apple iwatch ella se trata de un producto de calidad medium e verdad que e cuando tienes que ir de viaje pues ocupa poco e se puede usar como de llavero su e la verdad que muy chulo pero lo malo e que si lo usa como cargador normal de diario se calienta mucho por eso ella lo recomiendo solo en ocasiones donde puedes usar el cargador normal del apple iwatch se usa mediante puerto usb el color que mi mujer e pink ella le gusta mucho e un rosa bebe pastel la del producto el reloj se carga en unas do horas pero e verdad e muy muy lento en cargarse por eso el reloj termina mucho se trata de un producto que para una urgencia viaje que puedas disponer del cargador normal se saca de un apuro pero desde el punto de vista de mi mujer el producto se mejorar mucho el precio actual del cargador e de euro precio algo caro para ser un cargador,3.0 out of 5 stars

un cargador super que funciona bien con el apple watch con el que hemos probado con miedo ya que veces estos cargadores suelen funciona nada bien pero este va fino fino lo hemos usado con una externa con un cargador de pared en casos ha ido perfecto la potencia de salida e de v por lo que sobrecalienta el apple watch aunque tampoco lo carga con esto quiero decir que en cuanto velocidad de carga e como el cable original al tener la superficie imantada puedes ponerlo en una bateria otro cargador en forma vertical que se cae muy cuando accesible el poder cargarlo en horizontal para finalizar un par de detalles muy interesantes primero que el usb de entrada sirve en ambo sentidos por lo que hay que mirar en sentido se mete segundo que cuenta con un colgante para llevarlo en el llavero colgado de alguna otra parte tanto e un parte delantera junto la tapa del conecto usb como la trasera era un poco sobre este producto pero de probarlo ha parecido muy bueno recomendable,5.0 out of 5 stars
da die iwatch ist klein und kompakt der ladevorgang geht recht schnell und ist stunden bei der iwatch abgeschlossen sofern noch etwas akku vorhanden ist geht e auch schneller meist hat e bisher um die stunden gedauert die uhr wird magnetisch festgehalten das ein versehentliches nicht ganz einfach geht der magnet sie sogar noch der vertikalen ausrichtung fest den richtigen halt sorgt da aber die schutzkappe de usb steckers der einfach abgezogen und dann mit dem anderen ende auf den stecker gesteckt wird nur wenn da vertikal der vertikalen eingesteckt wird dann mus der magnet alles halten gerade unterwegs ein super die uhr leicht und kompakt und vom preis sehr ansprechend,5.0 out of 5 stars
todos sabemos que la carga del iwatch puede durar de un medio el cargador que lleva de serie viene con un cable yo almenos lo tengo puesto en uno de esos adaptadores para poder cargar varios productos de apple iphone iwatch etc con el que si lo tengo que llevar de viaje tenido tiempo de cargarlo pues que mejor que tener este cargador usb lo podemos dejar tanto en el coche como en la maleta usarlo en cualquier momento encima ocupa nada de espacio con cualquier adaptador usb usb lo podemos cargar mientras conducimos viajamos con transporte publico el precio lo veo aceptable si fuese algo ma barato ma esperemos que falle los la carga,4.0 out of 5 stars
